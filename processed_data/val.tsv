10	1	In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?	5	4	9
16	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have filled one with this priceless information and human interection. Computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, ""@CAPS3 and computer strength the @CAPS2. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands."" @CAPS4 hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wan't to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. In reality, computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it. Additionaly, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to reasearch @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things. Also, having the ability to learn about cultures can make peole peole and their cultures, they understand others something. Increase tolerance people are. Computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life. Lastly, computer and in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations. Bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happend in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can acess family members you scaresly visit. It can help you connect within your own family more. Oviously, computers are a useful aid in todays era. their advancements push the world foreward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach handeye coordination, give people the bility to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technologicall advancements. The world would be sectored and unified, contact between people scare, and information even. The internet is like thousands or librarys put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of palce you want people to live in?"	6	6	12
26	1	"Do you think that computers are useless? Or do you think they could be useful in many ways? I remember @CAPS4 my older sister had to do some research on @CAPS1, the computer gave her all of the information she needed. The issue to grapple with is, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly think that @CAPS2 does benifit society in many ways! Heres why, the computer allows you to get in touch with friends, research people, places or things, and relax and enjoy playing on a fun, entertaining website! My first reason is that @CAPS2 allows you to talk to family or friends so you all get back in touch if a friend of yours moved to a diffrent state, then you can easily get back in touch straight from the computer. ""@CAPS2's nice to send emails or pictures to friends, but if you do @CAPS2 from the computer then @CAPS2 gets done so much faster!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1, one of my neighbors. My next reason is that you can research anything you want like people, places or things and all refferances will come up. @CAPS2 is good to research for any projects, or school assignments you @MONTH1 have. I remember @CAPS4 my brother was working on his project. Everything he had trouble with, he found directly on the computer! My final reason is that there are alot of fun and exciting websites that you can relax and play on! These websites can keep you busy, and you wont be bored while playing! ""@CAPS4 im bored I go on the computer and play games, that I find on @CAPS5.com,"" @CAPS3 my younger cousin, @PERSON2. Computers @MONTH1 make people become adicted to them. Yes but, you will be learning some interesting things on how the internet works. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly beleive that they do benefit society, heres why you can get in touch with people, you can research, and play fun games! @CAPS2's now or never to decide what you think! Call me and we will talk this through."	5	4	9
37	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us. Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benifit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay intach with friends or family that live faraway, and stay orginized. Sometimes people are on the computer, learning and they don't even know @CAPS1. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, you automaticly see the news feeds of things happening around the world. Other times people go online diliberatly to learn. If someone is thinking about going to @LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about @CAPS1. Simply by searching equadore many choices will pop up you climate, sesonal weather, hotel options, and other farts. But thats not the only way people are learning on the internet. Now, many college students have the option of taking their lessons online. This is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay intouch with your friends if they moved away? I remember in second grade my bestfriend, @LOCATION2, move away. I was so sad. I badey ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a vidio chat! I felt like I was right their with her! This was great, and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. Another great way to stay intouch into friends and family is through e-mail. By writing a message and sending @CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easey, and your personal wants can chat and emails are a easey thing to send world wide. So many people love to type on a keyboard as well, but so many different papers that you type could be lost. I, for me, hate clutter, and I have so many school binders for papers to be lost in. This is why I take great advantage of typing my paper every chance I get. My computer keeps me orginiced because I could never loose my work. File save, is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. Then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy. I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason. Also, I myself am a much faster typer than I am writer so my work is a lot needey on the computer. As you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is goof for our society you can learn, stay intouch with friends and family, and stay orginiced. Many people, could agree with me. Don't you?	6	6	12
44	1	People are spending too much time on computers. People that spend to much time on the computer do not have time to interact with family or friends. People spened to much time on the computer. The kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. They also get tired every easy. First of all people spend to much time on the computer. @PERCENT1 of kids spend @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer. I once spent @NUM3 hours on my computer on @CAPS1. A lot of kids go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and iTunes. My friend spent @NUM4 hours on those websites. People spend way to long on the computer. Another reason, kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. @PERCENT2 of kids that spend a lot of time on the computer forget to study for test. Once I spent all night on the computer and the next day I failed a test. Kids forget to do homework to. My friend was having so much fun on the computer he forget to do his homework. Kids should get off the computer and worry about school.

I got so tired from being on the computer for so long I took a nap. @PERCENT4 of kids forget they made plans after school. One kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends. Kids need to get away from the computer. In conclusion, kids spend to much time on computers. People spend to much time on computer. Kid end up getting bad grade because they spend time on the computer. Aslo, kids get tired very quickly from being on the computer. Something has to be done about this.	4	4	8
62	1	"I think it is okay for people to use computers because they get to learn new things and meet new people. I don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs works on computers all day. @NUM1 each sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. I think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people. Slick, slack, slick, thats the sound of people typing ont he computer and meeting new friends and having a good time. When you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house. You get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world. I dont think its a bad idea to use computers because some peole who have jobs work on computers all day. I think people who uses computers all day while the're at work dont have to be classy, topuler or trendy, they just working to help themselves and theior family. YEah sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. They can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored. i remember the time when I was bored and I went on the computer to google who @PERSON1 was and I found out she was a famous sinher, someone I didn't know but heard about. Chantrail @CAPS1 a @NUM2 grade student says ""only people who want to learn something or meet new friends will use the computers. If you want to learn something new or meet new people then I suggest you stop eating those chips, get off that couch and use the computer."	4	4	8

Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. First computer is a great way to chat with friend that you havent spoke to in a long time. Also, it helps you meet new friends and to keep in touch with them in the long run.

Secondly, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great way to learn about history. You can find history on almost everything from the past to the present. You can learn history about famous people places and events. That why I think the computer technologie is so outstanding what you think will happen if we didnt have today? Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy because you take the time looking up information for school projects. Also, you can spent your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book flight ticket for vacation.

76	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, ""@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people threw the internet."" @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than @NUM3 miles away from you? If you do, @CAPS2 a computer will solve your problem of communication. @CAPS1 friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, ""I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in @CAPS1 essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with @CAPS1 family."" I didn't want to tell you this, but i was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and i learned just like @LOCATION2 learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated."	4	4	8
79	1	Computers have caused many people money, friends and time. In fact, since that the computers came out this year, lots of people has been spending web to much time of them. Which can cause people to loose time and friends. Computers and technology today have had a very influence on very many people. Spending too much time on computers can cause to loose time and money. For example, my oldest brother was very large at the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 because our computer started working, but this had a positive impact on him, he started participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse and that he was very at them and followed lacrosse through highschool. While doing this he and saves my parents money. This is @CAPS1 reason how computers have had a negative effect on people. The new technology has caused people to loose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would them in life. For example, many people in the @LOCATION1 have half of their day to computers, and not getting the exercise of this are video games of the day on computers. This is @CAPS1 affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends. For example, I used to be friends a person, but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire @DATE1 because he was always on the computer, which made me think that he did not want to be friends but actually he just deleted almost all of the the @DATE1 to the computer. Since this helped I have been over to his house about @NUM3 times this year as to every @DATE2. This is @CAPS1 way computers can change your life. The time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers. In my mind I that it would be best for everyone if we did not have the on computers, but if you do that we should have the an computers than put a certain time wait on computers. In your so you and your family members don't loose time, exercise time, or friends. Overall, I think that it would be best for everyone if we had a time on computers to the whole day on them.	5	5	10
84	1	I think computers help people out because you can learn about at here thing like @CAPS1 you want a job you can look it up in the computers. Also @CAPS1 you have a problem they will help you out. @CAPS1 you what to go some where you could go and be on the computer and look how it is and @CAPS1 you like it you could go @CAPS1 not look some where else you what to go. I think it a great thing @CAPS1 you look for people in the computer because you could talk to them and see them it realy cool. You can look for coltures in your computer what you want to learn. Like @CAPS1 you have a favert person you what to know about you can look it up in the computer and she videos or you can look up different sites it really cool. There games you can play online there alot of game and fun game learning games. Math game science game different games you what. Also you can us othere people that are planing the game game as you. It realy cool. I think the computer isn't bad for people computer help them a lot.	3	3	6
90	1	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 I think that computers are a good thing to use. I know that some people do use the computer instead of enjoying a or exercising, but not everyone does that, The computer is a good resource to invest time in. The effects computers have on people is good (for the most part). The statement is true, people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information quickly than the library. I believe that the effects a computer has on a person, are good effects. When people use a computer they can get information which for research and work (word) That's because, when your on a computer you can simply relax but get available amount of work done. You can also do things while your on the computer, hold your dog, hold your cat, eat, drink, text, call. It's very multi propose (use). But some computers is a bad thing because not how the very expensive and same dont have the money to buy a computer but if you do have, you because they're of people or example @CAPS4 cheated and not a computer he could have good so rich and rumors because the computer is what he needs to be succesful with microsoft so computers are useful and the effect they have on people is a positive one.	3	4	7
95	1	"Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they effect us in a posotive way. Computers can help us explore far away places that we @MONTH1 never go to. Maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homeworks. One reason why I think computers are only helping us is they help us explore othe places. I know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. But not at all of us can afford to travel far away. Most families however, do have computers. With these computers, kids with a parents permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place. ""I have always wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but my parents just don't have the proper incomg"" said @PERSON1 of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 school @CAPS4 I used my @CAPS6 and the internet to discover. HUNDREDS of amazing facts on it."" @CAPS4 as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams. Another reason why I think computers are good is they help you connect with friends. If you are like me, you like to talk to your friends. A @CAPS5! But sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. A solution a new wonderful machine called. The @CAPS6! You can chat long distances without being for it. This is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @LOCATION2. I thoughy I would never talk to him again. Then I learned about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. It allows you to talk whenever you want, whenever you want! Now, me and my friend can stay in touch and @CAPS4 can you! My finale reason as to why I think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. Even have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? How about the capital of a state that visit, slipped your mined? Well the @CAPS6 can solve both of those problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator. For the other @PERCENT1 you can download and install softwear onto your @CAPS6 for a low price. And every @CAPS6 made in this world has internet capabilities. All's you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride! @CAPS4 don'y worry about too much @CAPS6 use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. @CAPS4 remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. they also help us connect with no another, and help us excel in school. @CAPS4 get on, and get goin. Have you used your @CAPS6 today?"	5	5	10
100	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know how long you go on the computer for? Well get up and go outside. Thats one of my reasons why I think people spend to much time on it my other reason is your eyesit can go bad. Its a nice sunny day dont wast your time on the computer! Go outside! All, kids @CAPS1 is sit on the computer all day not getting exercis. Did you know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids that sit on the computers all day gain at least @NUM3? @PERSON1 told me that. I mean I believe him because its true kids dont get up.There missing a nice day out would you wanna miss a nice sunny day? My finall reason is kids eyesight can go bad. I mean having them stare at a screen all day, thats bad. @PERSON1 told me if your on the computer for @NUM4 hours on the computer for @NUM4 hours straight your eyes can get worst. I remember a tiny when I was on the computer for @NUM4 1/@NUM4 hours my eyes were killing me everything I blink. I know the computer is fun playing games, talking to friends but you should take a break and @CAPS1 something ples. In conclusion just go outside and have fun! @CAPS1 you want to wast a nice sunny day by staying in doors hurting your eyes? I know I @CAPS1!	3	4	7
102	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while. Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. They also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning. Most people try not to be overweight. Experts should Not try to have less people on the computer. One reason is that people can chat with one another. It can be friends, families, and more. About @PERCENT1 of people chat online with families or friends. Chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. It can make someone a better person. You can't agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand-eye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet. Using the computer this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the for a while is not a waste of time. People can you their time wisly on the computer. Surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer. So you should try to make people be on the computer less often.	4	4	8
110	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good to society, because you can read the news paper online, email your friends and family, and can play games and watch videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important, news paper are okay but you have to pay for them with the news paper online you can get the latest news for free! This way you can save money and trees. Heres another way of saving trees. E-mailing is a good to talk so some one far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. E-mail is also good for e-mailing links to cool websites, on e-mail can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, Computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on game sites, watch videos or movies or play on online game on just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bore I go on my computer and I can always find something to don on line or find a movie to watch. So, computers are very popular, in many areas computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are	3	3	6
120	1	Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to.	4	4	8
123	1	Every where you look people are using computers. Just about everyone has one. Some say that computers are bad for you but they can really benefit society. Computers are used for research, socializing and almost all of our @CAPS1 work is done on computers. One of the main things that computers provide is research information. If you want to find out anything, you can find it on the internet. It is an efficient way to study or find information for school. Before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. This was because all information was found in books. Books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got. Because of saearch engines and websites, you can type in whatever you want to look up. It is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer. Computers are the best way to research a topic. Computers are also used to socialize. You can chat with almost anyone on the internet. Being social is one of the most important parts of life. It has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone. The person you're talking to phnes only give you audio and that doesn't give you the some thing. video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression. Computers allow you to see people that you can't see otherwise. For example, if you have a relative that lives far way and you cant him or her, you can see them through video that socializing through computers is pne of the best ways to talk to people. Our @CAPS1 is mainly run on computers, without them, it would be very difficult to be aware of an on coming attack or threat. The @CAPS1 uses computers to store thir legal files of court cases laws, etc. It is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy. The store market is also run on computers. You need them to see how you are doing financially computers are essential to our @CAPS1 and economy. Although some experts say that computers do us no good, computers benefit our society very much. They help us research, socialize and they help our @CAPS1 and economy. Computers are essential to our way of life.	5	5	10
133	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, @CAPS2 is no doubt that computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. First of all, most people only have a limited amount of time to things. Secondly, many friends would get mad if you can'@CAPS6 see them. Last but not least, you have to watch out for your health. To sum up, computers aren'@CAPS6 always a good thing. From my point of view, time is a big thing. When people get so involved with something, its hard to back away. Thats just like smoking. The nicotine attracks you so once you start, it is very hard to quit. Many lazy people like to put things on hold. In other words, you waste time. The time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job, your wasting it. Other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off. For example, you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people do this in @LOCATION1 everyday. As you of all people can see, many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 think too much about time. The next big topic is @CAPS4. You and I both know that every one needs a @CAPS5. When you don'@CAPS6 interact with your Friends, your friends might not bother trying to talk to you. The might not even go near you if you forget about them. Pets on the other hand need you. They usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely. I'm sure that you know pets need love and need you to play with them. Parents need to be @CAPS2 for their kids. When you were little, didn'@CAPS6 you need help? I know I did. Thats why parents need to interact a lot. In conclusion, the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be. That leads us to the next big topic, health. Staying healthy's no joke. If you want to live long and watch you rkids grow up, the healthier you are the hotter you'll be. Everyone needs exercise. Exercise helps prevent against diseases as well as keepin gyou in shape. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 eople are over weight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screenplay games or sending e-mails, that's just as as palying video games on your @CAPS6.V. You know as well as anyone, most video games are not good for you. Last but not least, most people don'@CAPS6 eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer. You and I both know, a healthy diet and exersice will give you a happy life. From my point of view, computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. Time is a big thing which many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 realize. Secondly, @CAPS4 which everyone needs is another important thing to look into. Last but no least, everyone everywhere needds to stay healthy. For a long happy life. As you can see, many people would be better off without computers!	5	5	10
144	1	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are a help to our plant. The new technology makes life easier to handle. The computer are a help because it teaches hand-eye coordination. You can talk to people, and it is a new way to be entertained. Computers can teache hand-eye coordination because of typing. Whether someone knows it or not when you are typing fast it is help you hands. Also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move. The typing is giving your hand lots of exersise because your hands are moving all over the place. The more you move them the more excersise you can get. Computers can really help hand-eye coordination alot. Computers can also help by talking to people. To talk to people far away is better to talk to on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other. You are able to talk to people from different countries. Also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations. Like if part of the business is doing a project in hong kong, then the boss can set up a meeting to see how it is going. Another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person. Like if a oerson is in the hospital but you're not able to go, then you can talk while seeing each other throw the computer. Computers are a great way to use in communication. Computer are also a new way to get entertained. They can entertain you because there is games that you can play. There are games that come with the computers and a lot of games on the internet. Other they being bored all the time you can play thousands of game with just a click on a mouse. Also to not be bored you can watch videos like youtube. You can listen te musicor watch comedy videos. Video also show a way do express what you feel and sat it in comedy, horror, or sad videos. Also for teenagers there is ways to talk to their friends like facebook. On the website you can talk with anyone on your friends list. In the end computer can help kids, adults, or teenagers. With just a clicking your mouse you can find a new powerful way of technology. And be able to got better hand-eye coordination talk to people and get entertained. So go get yourself a computer and amazed!	4	5	9
151	1	Dear local newspaper I don’t agree with the people who say people spend to much time on their computers. Because people can lean mostly anything they want all of a computer also there are lots of resomes why people should use advances technology they can teach kids how to find out answers to there homework the fastway instead of reading a book or taken a class and still get the full understeading. The people that say others spend's to much time on there computers are also right about that but they still can interact with friends and family they can play games, speak to each other, even learn new things together, all through a computer. One thing they were right about was to go out and enjoy the nature you cant do that on a computer but you can help the nature on a computer like try to put up a blog. Something that people make so others can see and spred the word and on that blog it can stay stop cuting down trees for stores or stop killing animales for there far or anythin you wont to write. So the people that do read this you should agree with me because you can do lots of things on a computer and learn lot more then you ever thought you could. So go out and find you a computer and find somethine you need to do or learn or just to have some fun.	4	4	8
153	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 are many people in this world that think always being on the computer is good because they can talk with people online and learn more about the world. But, then @CAPS1 are people who disagree with them. I am one of those people. Spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life. People stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. So, I hope that while you read through this letter, you take some of this information into consideration. First of all, when people spend a lot of time on the computer they aren't getting all of the exercise that their body needs. They become lazy and don't want to do anything. This is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. People @MONTH1 become overweight and since they got lazy from always being on the computer, they won't go out and get the exercise that their body needs. People need to enjoy their life! By always being on the computer, they won't be able to. @CAPS1 are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body. You can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. Many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. But, some of their family and friends are to lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer. Instead, they stay inside the house all cooped up and don't get enough fresh air. This is a horrible thing to do to yourself. Your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! Finally, people @MONTH1 lose contact with family members of their friends because they are to busy on the computer playing games. I know I wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and I don't think anyone else would want to either. I once lost a friend or two because I didn't talk to them as much as I used to because I had been too busy on the computer on @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and games. I felt horrible because I didn't realize that I had been doing that. I really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. Its horrible and you don't feel like yourself anymore. Once again I would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. You can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and @MONTH1 lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend to much time on the computer. I hope that after reading this, you realize that being on the computer is not always good for you.	5	4	9
161	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a very positive effect on people. I agree that computers have a positive effect. They teach hand-eye coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about people and places, and you can talk online @CAPS3 first reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. for example, when you learn how to type, you can memerize the keys. Therefore, you don't have to look down at the keyboard. Computers also teach hand-eye when using a mouse. When you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon. @CAPS3 final reason that computers teach hand eye is once you what to do, you don't have to serch the screen for an icon. You could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do. Computers teach hand-eye coordination when you type, when you move the mouse to click on an icon, and when you memorize all of the icons. @CAPS3 second reason is computers make you smarter. For example, if you have a history project, and you need to know about china, you can use the computer. How many times would china be in the newspaper? Using the computer can access quick information. Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew about. You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds. @CAPS3 last example is that a serch engine can look up famous pictures. If you are working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can have the photos you need. Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries, you could look up people, and famous countries. @CAPS3 last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends, for example, you could catch up with friends you don't see that much during school. Talking online is just as fast as texting. Also, you could continue a conversation you had with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, you can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, you can just plain talk. You could make plans, or you can talk about upcoming events. Computers give you access to talking with your friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on other people. You can get hand-eye coordination, you can look up foreign countries and people, and you can talk with your friends.	5	5	10
167	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are beinging questioned if the are good for our society or not. I would have to say that they are good and bad you really can't pick a side. These good because children and teens can get the information they need to teach in school, it allows people to chat with others in different places, and it helps hand-eye cordanation. Those were the good here are some bad things about compters. People spend to much time on the computer instead of exercising, they dont' get to enjoy nature, and people stop interacting with friends and family. Anyone can pick a side. I just can't, because i can relate to both sides. For example. one of the good reasons about computers was that you can chat's with other people around the world. I can relate to that because when i live here in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 my mom and stepdad live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 so i don't see them much but thanks to computer i can chat. With them when ever i want to. Honestly i wouldn't know how my life would be like if i didn't have a computer and i wasn't able I @CAPS4 now. Although, can also to one or the bad things about computers, which is that people spent to much time on the them. I can relate to that and so could of the other well, because when i around @NUM1 because go to a after school, go straight on my laptop and around @NUM2. When my grandma @NUM3 pm. She always comes in and ""Your on that thing to much you your hands!"" in her. So in my opinion I believe that coumpters can be good for our socity and bad; for me there is no side to take. Others might feel the same way, and others @MONTH1 not. It's up to them to make a choice, so ask your self,"" @CAPS4 you believe that computers are good or bad for our society?"	4	4	8
169	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after reading your article about advances in technology, I would like to offer my opinion about this contraversal subject. All around the world, people are using computers to do all sorts of things; weather its for games, the buying and selling of items, talking with people in different countries; the possibilites are endless. This is, however, not nessessarally a good thing. Many people become addicted to computers. Esspecialy adolesents, who enjoy the games that computers offer. From personal experience being addicted to computers, I can honestly say that I was under almost complete control by that computer. My grades started to go down, I stopped interacting with my friends and family, and trouble on things. Many parents watch their children go through this and are sometimes helpless to stop it. This poses a large problem for parents. My word of advice; don't let your children become addicted!	3	3	6
184	1	Dear people that read the news paper and that have @CAPS1 that like to play the computer all day more. Than a hour. I think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper. I am writing this article about @CAPS1 using the computer more than an hour. My first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school. To support that reason so you dont think i am making this up is that they play the computer alot and it makes the @CAPS1 just think about the computer and not think about school. They play it so much and it can mess up the @CAPS1 and they can not focus in school. My second main reason is it makes them allways want to talk about the computer. So if they play it mare than a hour like i said it can cause them to be addicted like drug's it is just like that if you dont want your @CAPS1 to be addicted to drugs i hope you woudnt want your own @CAPS1 to be addicted to the computer. To continue about your @CAPS1 can allways @CAPS2 about the computer it can make your @CAPS1 sound like they have no life because they play it all day everday and I would hope you woudnt want your @CAPS1 to be like this. Most importantly my final reason why you shoudnt let your child play the computer for more than a hour a day. Because they can get over weight. Your @CAPS1 well only get up and go to the bathroom, and eat, they will only do stuff that is in the house. Your @CAPS1 will not go out side and play and they wont get no exerse at all. I hope you will understand where I am coming from I have a brother that is offering in the hospital right computer too much and it messed and the doctor said he make it not so I am praying that he well make it out alive so I hope you woudnt let you @CAPS1 do this it will mess up their life forever. Thank you so much for takeng you own @CAPS4 Time to read this article I hope you would remember this article for your whole ontire life.	4	4	8
189	1	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you turn there is technology. It's not going to change. Try a schedule. Encouragment helps a lot of people. Activities keep you mind off things read on to find our more. Scheduleing is important. Limit the time on the computer. For every half hour at least @NUM1 minutes outside or with friends. try to memorize the schedule. Encouragement helps me and alot of people! Try to encourage family and friends, The goverment is also trying to fight this. Encouragement helps. Activities can keep people off the computer. Try neighborhood activities. After-school activities for a while. All kinds of stuff is fun. Do you think scheduling helps? Do you like encouragement? Do activities keep you mind off things? then by far this stuff helps.	3	3	6
213	1	Dear local newspaper, I just wanted to say that I do I agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer. My reasons are that people need to exersize, go out doors. And have fun. If you keep reading you'll understand why they need to do theis things. My first reason was exersizeing. And the reason why I say exersizeing is because you don't need to be on the computer all day long. So many things that they can do, is run, jog, and go for bike rides. I mean it's ok to go on the computer once and a while to learn but that's why they have books, and school to learn about things. My second reason was going out-side and the reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day. Another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time. My other reason was nature. And what I mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there to. Another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long. My last reason was you can talk to your friend about stuff, you can go to the mall all day, you can also hang out with your friend and have a sleep over and watch movies. You don't need to stay on the computer all day you need to have fun. This is why I say you don't need to be on the computer. You can do other stuff and still learn with-out being on the computer. For once maby insed of talking online you can actultly go to your friends house and talk. Thank you for your time. Hope to talk to you soon.	4	4	8
221	1	Some people @MONTH1 think that computers take up too much time for the important things. But really everything you would like to know is right there. You can learn about nature, cool websites even history. Here are my reasons on the effect on computers. First, you can learn so much about nature online. You can view many types of animals and study them. Learn about plant and the effect they have on life. Also, you can learn about many things on @LOCATION1 and how its changing. Secondly, there are many coll websites you can join. Theres games you can play to keep you occupied during the day. You can even chat online with friends or maybe find long lost friends. School sites are available for students of some studying or help. Lastly, computers show you so much about history. People who things and world famous people from back then compared to famous people now. Most important of all, the life changing story about and how it changes peoples life today. I hope I've you enough to agree with me. As you can see computers have many resources you can learn from learning websites and history arent even half of them. Think about! Thank you for listening	3	3	6
227	1	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a good thing to have for the following three reasons. First, they help people learn by looking up information on different places. Second, the help people talk to friends and family using @CAPS2. Lastly they help people become less stressed by playing computers games. Learning is important and with computers, you're able to learn faster. Computers help you learn about faraway places like @LOCATION1. It is much easier to learn on the computer than to go to the library and check out a book. If you're working on a project and you needed some last minute information, you could just go to the computer and search you're topic. Learning on a computer is much more convenvent then going to the @CAPS1. Another reason computers are good is because you can talk to friends and family who are far away using something called @CAPS2. @CAPS2 allows someone to talk to another person using the computer. These people could live just down the block or half-way accrose the world. My cousin is living in spain for a semester in college. I've skped with her many times. The cool thing about @CAPS2 is that you can acctually see the person you're talking to on the computer screen. @CAPS2 is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends who are faraway. My last reason is that computers help lower your stress level by playing games. Computer games are alot of fun to play. They have games that range from @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the word, to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 beauty barn. Computer games are a great way to lower your stress because instead of piking your self up with to much work, you'll be calming your selfdown with computer games. They also gave educational games. like, Which country is which. This game teaches you geoagrahy while you have fun. Computers are a great thing to have. They help you learn about faraway places, talk to people who live faraway and play fun computer games. Computers are always going to be used and never put to waste. Theres always something you can do when you go on a computer.	5	4	9

238	1	Dear Newspaper I strongly agree with experts on computer's. Those who support advances in technology believe that computer's have a positive effect on people. They say that computers teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn from faraway places and even allow people to talk with others online. Theese effects are true but there are many other bad effects to that they dont like to say. Computers also effect people's visiion as you are really close to the screen, computers are really addicting for many people all around the world and having them do bearly no excercize moving many people to a big problem now n days which is obesity. Computer's also tend to take a lot of time away from people's lives. The way I see it to is that although computer's have some positive effects on people you can change those positive effects in a better way that can keep you fit to and seeing places with your eyes, like you can get practice with hand-eye coordination by simply getting a friend and pass tennis balls back and forth quick so at the same time your exercizing to. Also a computer can have you talk with your friends online but why not talk to them by phone if there far away n go outside and catch some fresh air n if they live close by why not talk to them in person instead. or if you want to learn about a certain far away place why not visit the place instead. There are many things you can do that a computer can do and better. but yet im not saying a computer is all bad at all. I agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers as well as most things in the world we live in. In my opinion to I honestly think there are more bad effects then good effects for computer's.	4	5	9
248	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I Computers is a new technology that keeps on getting better and better. It can do many things like help you learn something new and see new/old friends. Even some people do online education. Also what a lot of people like about computers is the games. Computers are a great benifit to us and can be useful and fun. The computer can teach us many new and exciting things. There can be a lot to learn too. Somethings you could learn about on the computer are places, people, animals, plants, food, etc. I have once had to find a recipe for carmel apples and to do so I used the computer. Some people use the computer for there education. There are online college and online high school. Its like a new way to be home schooled. Not everyone can go to big @CAPS1 so it is easier for them to use an online college. Also, lets say your doing a project and you need information instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it. There are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends. I friends, everyone has friends either new friends or old friends. Back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter. With computer you can now send a letter faster then before. Its now called an email. Which you just type what you want and click..send it off to your friend. Not all use an email, some use instant messaging. An example of that would be aim or meebo. I moved from @LOCATION1 to hear and I have friends I don't get to see much. I bet there are many people that have that same issue. Well with the computer you can now see people! chat and see them. For instance @ORGANIZATION2 is a way to see your friends like that. Its a easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even you family. There is still more that a computer can do. Another thing it can do is play video games. They are so much fun to play and what I am talking about is video games. Kids them even teens and adults love. Whenever your bored you can go play online games. Or you can have games you purchesed and play them. They are entertaining and fun too! Even very little kids can play games. Sometimes you can even play with you friends online with a online game. I know when I get bored I go on the computer and play a game called @CAPS2 @NUM1. Computers are great and there are pently of more things you can do other than what I was taking about. I hope I have convinced I or showed you how computers are a benifit to us people.	4	5	9
260	1	Over one million people on the computer daily. I think being on the computer is unhealthy. So many people abuse themselves staying on to long. You should manage a time schedule so you can still get excercise dont use the computer if needed. People become overweight also. I think people should do something els then use the computer. One main effect that see is many people play the computer too long and are becoming overweight. This can be stopped if we all join together. One person isn't going to change anything. But many of us will. We can be the huge dangerous preditors going for the prey. If there is something els to do besides play the computer do it. If you know your over weight from the computer. You!! Can make a change. If you keep doing other activities you can get skinny again easily. You just gotten make that type of change. A serious issue is people don't wanna take time to make a quick little chart to manage computer useage. The way isee it is if we make a chart then we will know when to get off and twhen to play. This is important because some people take in information better when they have it infront of them. This could make some satisfying results. People use the computer for school work. This is good depending on how long it takes. In my opinon people shouldn't be on the computer or more then @NUM1 hours to @NUM2 hours a day. I think people should get their schoolwork done and get off. I much rather see kids outside playing. The nature and wildlife is much more important. The effects on the computer puts on us can vary. If its not to overweight to not spending time with families, to doing schoolwork. You need to use your time wisely.	4	3	7
265	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be to much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. But add to that the imense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly.	5	6	11
274	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 would you like to be warmly greted by the zingbobway tabe @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION2, say hi to a far away family memorr again or maybe quicker your relfexes? Well you can! Computers are a use ful way @ORGANIZATION1 complexing an @ORGANIZATION1 these tasks. Imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away. Wouldn't you want to see them at least once? Computers allow you to interact with them with webcams. You can see them and talk with them. Not only can you talk with family, you can talk to friends. You can make new friends from around the world without leaving your house. You can have a new best friend every day! Not only can you talk to people on computers, they give you better hand eye coordination, and they quicken your raflexes. Dr. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1,. says ""@CAPS2 have shown that people who type or use a computer have better reflexes than those who don't."" @CAPS3 a computer around is easier for school also I remember one time, I had to write a @NUM1 page paper for @CAPS4 and it was due the next day. I wrote the beginning @ORGANIZATION1 it and my hand started to cramp up. I had in finnish my paper soon so I ran to my computer and typed it in half the time I would've spent writing it. I also got a good hand-eye coordination . Not only do you type on it, you learn on it. @NUM2 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM3 computers are used for learning about place and people. Say you just won @NUM1 free tickets to go anywhere in the world with a celebrity at your choosing! With a computer you could research anywhere you want and make that trip the best days @ORGANIZATION1 your life. And even if you don't like actually going to other places, you can virtually go there on a computer. With computers you can see the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, the tropical reef fish @ORGANIZATION1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 at the. Computers hold the world at your finger lips. So as you can see computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to interact with cites, increase your hand-eye coordination, and allow you to have the world at your fingertips. So stop reading and use a computer!"	4	5	9
278	1	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers effect people in a positive way. Computers increases our knowlage, lets us communicate with our friends and family, teaches us hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. Computers are enjoyable, great pieces of technology. Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen is not very interactive, computers increase our knowlage. Computers have all these websites that are full of great information. You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want. Going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time. Instead you can look up the facts you need online. Computers also let us communicate with family and friends. Calling someone or sending a letter costs money, but sending on email to someone does not. Many people have family and friends that live far away from them. Through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense. You can also see each other through a webcam. Which you can attach to your computer if it has not have in one allready. Another reason why computers are useful is because they help with hand-eye coordination. Computers require you to type, which is a great skill. While working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer. Typing takes to get good at but is very helpful. Finally Computers help us get our news foster. When major things happen, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 it was all over the internet before the news. In conclusion computers are very useful and help us increase our knowlage, communicate with people, help us with hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. But most importantly computers are fun!	4	4	8
282	1	Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research. Without computers, kids an adults won't be provided with the necissary tools for knowledge. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home and that @NUM3 person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects. Another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together. Facbook, @CAPS2, and twitter users can chat with people accross the street, accross the country and even accross the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION3! My last reason is that computers are great for buiesnessess. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their buisness is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper. Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but thats them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people! They give us research, they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world.	4	4	8
283	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think its a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because it does teach kids something, it good to do homework on and you can relax when your on it. Well computers teaches kids a lof of things like hand-eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it. There is also websites that can show you how to move yor hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the comptuer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dont have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time. That is why I think you should keep computers and not exercise as much. We get enuf of that in school carry all these heveay books around.	3	3	6
285	1	"I walked into my living room. I saw my mom avidly reading the screen of our computer with pictures of caller masters and logos clastering the web page as well. I thought that the internet had just my mom better than I could that we should go on vacation. More and more people log on to a computer everyday, and although the people willing to change and believe in new advances in technology out on a strong argument of why computers are and there are still some that can only see the negative. I strongly support computers and believe they have a lot of potential. Computers make the work even smaler. They allow to talk to people thousands at miles away man instant. Also, you can reconnect with friends that you can't see anymore. For example, I used to go to an awesome @DATE1 camp and I made same of my best friends there. But @DATE1, they down, and instead of playing sports and having fun, I layed down on my basement to stand up because my sweat glued to the. Then one day, I heard the familiar that my computer's spokes when I receive an instant @CAPS1, I the energy to crawl over to the screen, to find out @PERSON1, one of my closest friends from wanted to take a bike ride down to the wall, and hang out with some other people we knew. to say I happily respond, ""@CAPS2 I definetly want to go,"" by a long scores of points. been for computers and @ORGANIZATION1. Instant @CAPS3, @CAPS4 would all have drifted apart and never talked again. anadem exaggerated argument people use against computer is that everybody that uses them doesn't exercise. I frequent my computer almost every hour, so I made a system to ensure I got exercise. Every time I walk the room my computer is hooked, I grab the pull up right and do @NUM1. I only thought of this system @NUM2 months ago and I have already my own muscles, and I can do @NUM3 pull as at a time but when I started I struggled to do @NUM2. If not for the amazing of computers that me back, I would still do exercise, only to after about a week. Computers give easy to the internet, which has so much information it is. Unless it is a closely grounded secret. You could probably find whatever you want on the internet. Ive gone countless time to find for an essay with the limited textbooks have just isnt what you need. My country project @DATE1 year couldn't have had more than @CAPS5 pleces of information from a book! It also makes a great teacher of about any subject as well. As a matter of fact, my language arts teacher told us a story about how ever the @DATE1 a ball that has never done any sort of water sports before, spent @NUM2 weeks watching videos on youtube about how to waterski, and on his first dearly doing tricks. These are only a few of the reasons I think computers are great. They keep friend ships close, give you a reason to exercise, and can teach you anything! I say we spread the good word about computers and let every one know how awesome they are."	6	5	11
329	1	Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to pick being for computers. There are a couple reasons why I'm for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn stuff, and you can also play video games. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to freinds online. So if you have a facebook or myspace you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend they will receive those exacte words then they'll reply. For example if you wanted to just say hi then your friend would look at his/hers messages then just reply. So being able to talk to friends online is one example why I for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn things. So if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site. What I mean is if you goto google a whole bunch of site's will come up, so what you want to do is find the fastest easyest site for you. So being abe to learn important things like a language is another reason I'm for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. What I mean is if you were borde and noone to talk to then you can get on your computer and play a mind numbing game or an educational game for class. For example in science class we played a game on the computer and it had to do with gravity and that was what we were learning about so it was an educatinola game. So that is the last reason why I'm for computers. I'm for computer because you can play games. So now you know why I'm all for computers. I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff and play video games.	4	4	8
330	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a possitive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a possitive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including chicken, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can go onto facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happend to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. Thiss guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity if has had on society but @DR1 the good the computer is doing."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands thousands of dollars on buying the computers and @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computers. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2, on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't go. Statistics show thas @PERCENT3 of families have waste their college money in computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1 do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth @CAPS1 your children at."	6	5	11
331	1	Dear @CAPS1, A recent study by scientists shows that too much sitting down, especially in front of computers is dagerous to health. This is only one reason why I think that, although they are useful, computers are not entirely beneficial to our society. The hinder us from excersising, interacting with nature, and spending time with family and friends. Excercising, as we all know, is necessary to remain as a fit and health human being. But how is this possible with some people going to work everyday and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day. Too much computer time even for kids, can lead to obesity and overweightness. Also, like I mentioned before scientists have concluded asked, that too much sitting is bad for you. It isn't how the body was built to work. If you have seen wave, one of @ORGANIZATION1's most recent movies, undertaking is easy. The humans in that movie, after relying on computers for so long, became obese and fat and had no muscle. This is an of course, but minor visions of this are going around the world. Going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy. The next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature. Even simulations don't cut it. If you wanted to see a frog or of some other animal, can't just @ORGANIZATION2 it, look for it in the real. Developing a connection to nature can really nurture the use of that is and ill. Instead of exploring a computer, explore the world as we know it until it's or you're too old. Learn how to do somthing by. Instead of hiring someone to make at, make it yourself. Do it to learn it, sit at a computer website to hire someone! Get up and get outside! As you become more dependent on your computer, you become less dependent on family and friends. It causes there to be a lift between family members. Your family might not be able to help you when you're in need. If you're an adult, and you're on the computer all the time for something other than work, then your not supporting your family, you have no income, no life, and no future. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Imagine this!:You have nothing except your laptop. You're a , on and have family relations. Nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets! You have nobody and nothing except for your computer, and you've wasted your life away. Too much time on your computer means that everyone suffers. To sum it all up, computers maybe, but every single cloud has a dark lining. Computers stop us from exercising, interacting with nature, and being with our families. So get outside!	5	5	10
336	1	"Dear @CAPS1, ""@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific acident"" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be @NUM1 minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this @MONTH1 bring up many conflicts; as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of peoples' lives. When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem ""too good to be true."" @CAPS4 you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed some time in their life I can clearly remember when someone. I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later That day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who @MONTH1 not know any better at risks. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. in addition, computers steal much of peoples' time to the point where family, 'doing homework and exercising is limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it everyday with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed a side. The only words from his mouth are, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game, turns two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are update status or pictures on @CAPS6 for three hours every night. Isn't their a point where we can draw the line. between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed ;the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue. Computers take away peoples' free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers; but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that their are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 bring. Computers can harm relationships, finances and your personal life more than you would think!"	6	5	11
340	1	Computers, More and more people are using them. They are used to talk, for lesieure and many other things. But are computers a good thing? Computers can be a very good thing to have around. Besides practically unlimited information, you can stay in touch with your family using @ORGANIZATION1. You can use @ORGANIZATION2 word to make documents and powerpoint presentations that organize your ideas. Also you can use @ORGANIZATION2 excel to manage your finances! Windows movie maker allow you to contruct your own movies ifl you own a camera. Besides the obvious most helpful features, you can play computer games, watch mores and listen to music on a computer. Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are small and some can be very big. computers are expensive. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer. Also, many people have important information on a computer. Peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer rendering it imposible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence and drug use are all over the web. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over peoples lives. People spend too much time on facebook and not enough time reading or keepng in touch with family. Computers can be great things. Between their great features allowing you to be informed all the time and programs that or be great for managing buisness, it's no wonder almost every @CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I disagree. Yes, the cons can be annoying & sometimes serious. But if your smart enough to stay away from @CAPS2-@CAPS3, install anti-virus software, and never give away your information to an unamed surce, the pros outweigh the cons. So overall, if your smart enough, a computer can be a fun, convienent edition to your life allowing you to do more than you ever imagined.	4	5	9
341	1	Did you ever need to know something about another place, or maybe want to see your baby cousin who is not a baby anymore? Having a computer is a huge benefit to society. It not only ables you to find out information, and chat with family and friends but also can teach you hand eye coordination. A computer can tell you just about anything you need to know. This could help you learn about other cultures, places, or something as simple as what is @LOCATION1 creampie. the computer has endless knowledge. This is a huge benifit because a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button. Having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends. New computers now have webcams. This benifits you to see and speak to them without having to get on a plane or any long car rides. Which I know is a big benifit for everyone who has relatives that don't live right next door whether it helps your swing in baseball or to catch that touchdown, having a computer is a big help in hand-eye coordination. Believe it or not, having to type a paper for school helps out alot in hand-eye coordination. Having hand-eye coordination can help you out a lot in life whether in activities, school work, or jobs. It is obvious that having a computer is a huge benifit to society by having that ability to learn more, chatting with family and friends, or to help you pass the football with one of your buds. The society today wouldn't be the same without computers.	4	4	8
352	1	Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people go outside and exercising because their are three reason why people should go outside and there are: people don't have a lot of exercising, they can hang out with their friend and family, and people and kid should enjoying the outsid nature. Let me explain, people and kids these days do have alot of exercising. People who don't exercising can gran weight if they don't exercising at all. Also, parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be over weight. Kids these day, have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by staying on their computer and play their computer game. Wouldn't you agree the kids and adults can hang out with there frienda and family. Kids need to stop going on the computer and go outside more offing with their friend or family. You might want to consider that parent need to spend time with there friend and family then staying on the computer at home. Don't you think that people should go outside and enjoying the nature. Amazingly, people know what nature is but the don't know what the true meaning of nature is! Adult should spend time by going outside then stayin at their house because @PERCENT1 of the world dont have computer at all.	4	3	7
358	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personaly disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The reason why I disagree is because it not the computers folt people don't get out and exercise. Buying a computer and getting on the computer is free will and the computer dosen't you get on it that's our choice so we can't blame the computer for people not excerising. Another important thing to remember is that computers are important is because they help you get more educated. For example there are computer class online for people that want to there degree in different fields, with just a click of a button you it can change you future and career for the rest of you life. The most important reason is because it help people learn about different cultures and ways of life. I love learning about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2 even through they had that terriable storm. I thank you for listening to my opinon and I hope that it change's your point of living a life without computers	4	3	7
361	1	Computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers help people in many ways. They teach people about history and faraway places. They also are a great way to yourself. Computers also are another way to comunicate to people for away it only a few houses down. Computers have a of knowledge and more is added everyday. Everyday i go on the computer i learn something new. You can search the word @LOCATION1 and instantly have millions of web pages in fron of you that all had new knowlage and exciting things about @LOCATION1. Computers are much faster than having to go down to local library and look for a book that has the information you need. You can also find diffrerent veiws and perspectives of a subject online. Depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events, which you cannot find books at the library. Computers have a amount of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things. Computers can also entertain you. There are many entertaining website online that you can go to when you bored. There are books and magazines you can read at anytime you want. If you like to read then check online, these @MONTH1 be a book you enjoy free of charge to read. Some people like to play games. On the computer you can find almost any game you want to play. These are board games, video games, strategy game, adventure games, and many many more than that. I could go on for hours listing at the different types. If you like sports you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports. You could find ways to improve how you play or you to play that sport. If you like to watch @CAPS1. you can also do that on a computer. Some @CAPS2.V programs put the diffrent episodes online so people can easily view them just by one click of the mouse. Computer can anybody who uses it. Computers help tech you things entertain you. but they also can communicate to your friends and family. Many programs let you to people through the internet. You could send emails to your cousin half way across the world. In emails you can attach pictures and files with text to communicate. These are various programs. IM means instant messaging, that means that instantly you message to another person using that program. You put a message in and away it goes instantly reaching ther person you trying to teach. Now thse are even more to communicate. you can make audio calls to a person using the computer. It is like a phone just not.Web cams make it possible to record and send video instantly, but can also uses to talk to one through a video call. The program connects you to your friends or family and you can see them thourhg a video. computers are a great way to comunicate with others. Computers help in a positive way. They give you access to an amazing amount of information. They can you. Computers also great way to communicate to people no matter how far away that person is. I would completly say that computers are a positive thing.	5	5	10
371	1	About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature.	4	4	8
373	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, I have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern day computers have on society. Some people feel they have a positive effect, such as learning new information, and interacting or chatting with other people. Others feel that society is devoting to much time to computers, they feel that these people are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and with their family. I feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer. People think that all things on the internet are true, they're not, @PERCENT1 of all teens across the country are addicted to the computer. First, things posted on the internet are not always true. They can be posted by anyone, whether it's true or not. My friend found a website with very detailed information for an essay. She turned it in, and the teacher gave it back the following day. In big red letters it said ""false information"" @CAPS2 she had gotten the information from a book. she pobably would've gotten an ""A+"". Second, @PERCENT1 of teens living in the @LOCATION1 have become addicted to using the computer. My friend was obsessed with facebook from @NUM1 until @NUM2 she was on, daily. She began failing classes. She didn't do homework, didn't study for tests! She failed the @NUM3 grade. This all happened because she was addicted to a website. This is why I agree with the statement that experts are concerned with people spending to much time on the computer @CAPS2 you want to continue a healthy lifestyle, and avoid becoming to addicted to the computer, limit yourself. Make the smart choice."	4	4	8
390	1	I think that computers do benefit us. They allow us to interact with people, talk to family far away, help us with school, gives us easy access to information, and much more people usually have family and friends who live away from each other and the computer allows us to interact with them. The computer lets us email and instant message them, play games against them, be their friend on websites like facebook so you can see recent pictures of them. It's not easy to interact with family and friends who live so far away and the internet allows us to do that. The computer doesn't just let you talk to family and friends but it lets you meet new people and interact with new people from all over the world. It let's you make new friends and play games with them or chat. The computer really helps you to just stay in touch with other people and it's a very easy and convinent way to do so. The next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us. Children are very hiper and after homework is done, we don't have anything to do so the computer let's us play games on it, chat with friends, watch movies and videos, up load picture, etc. It does alot for us. Kids could hang out after school but if they can go on the computer it allows them want to go home where their parents know that their safe and away from drugs, alcohol, and other bad things they can get into. Just because kids like the computer, that doesn't mean that that's the only thing they do. Kids are very athletic, always playing sports and always hiper but the computer helps that go away. They go to school for hours, then go to basketball or football practice, sometimes we just need a break. The computer isn't always fun but it's very useful. The computer helps us with school. It allows us to type essays and projects. It also allows us easy information to help write the essays. Websites like google and bing are easy websites to help us get good and accurate information about whatever the topic is that we are doing. The computer is very useful when it comes to school. As you can see, the computer is very important in our lives and makes life alot easy and it's your choice how much you want to spend on it. But no matter what, the computer definatly benefits us.	5	5	10
393	1	@ORGANIZATION1, Are technology is advancing greately and more inventions are coming out; but aren't you worried that people spent to much time on the technology? I know @CAPS1 worried. For example computers. Computers have to technology to go online and chat with various people all around the world. Thas when I get worried. In this essay I will explain why it is bad to spent too much time on computers. it is bad because people don't execisi enjoy mothers nature, and interact with family and friends. Firstly, people are for geting how important it is to excaise. It is very important because it keeps you fit and healthy. With the computers in use people become less fit and healthy. They start getting fat theire carasaprel get high and they stress more. Secondly they don't enjoy mothersnature. When people start going on the computers they stop doing a lot of things. Like stop going outside and getting fresh air. They get c losed in a small bubble and all they case about is the computers. They don't go out to camp, play outside; they don't do nothing. Every day they are on the computer. Finaly, one big main problem is: they stop inter acting with family and friends. When mothers and fathers are oh it they don't pay attention to these young ones and they are always on it. When teenagers are on the computers they don't talk to these parents, they ignore there friends and the people that care about them most. They wont care for everybody, but them selfes @CAPS2 there you have it; that is why I think we should cut down on the computer usage. For these following reasons: People stop exercising and being fit. They stop enjoiying mother nature, and they stop @NUM1 with family and friends. @CAPS2 what do yoo think?	4	4	8
422	1	Dear, Who ever this concerns Some people are to obssesed with computers. They usually stay up all night playing games or going on @CAPS1. The people who love computers rarely iteract with people they like to be left alone with no one bothering them. Some people that go online to research stuff are probable being lied to maybe someones just messing with them. If you love computers so much that you stay up all night and don't get any sleep then you miss work and you get tired then you know you have a problem so quit. You dont want to stay up al night. Because you could have something important to do and you miss it like your childs party becuse you husband or wife typed to wake you up. But you didn't want to go you miss it and your child never trust you again when you stop interacting with other people you really got a problem because you need want to go any were but to get junk food and soda. Computers all the time is bad for you sometime you get cranky when someone takes it away that is when you need to realize what you are doing and go get some exercise is what you need you got to get some or you end up unhealthy which is bad for you and you want to stop that habit and get a new one. When your write a report you tend to go to the internet. It @MONTH1 be agood sorce but it could be lying and you could turn in the worst report ever you @MONTH1 of copy and pasted but you could still the not have to be your reliable sorce use your use a good good book. The internet is a bad thing it could consume you don't use it all the time the people make computer should shut all the computers world for one week so we know how it is with out internet.	4	3	7
450	1	Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people.	4	3	7
453	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people. In the past their have been more negative effects on people. In a survey taken in @CAPS2 magazines @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT1 of people, have negative effects with computers. Inmy opinion, I think comuters have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. @CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer your not really interacting with. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them. Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer. Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air. too but learning about nature is more nature. If you dont enjoy nature you dont know what is going on.NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on. in a survey taken in a local magazine @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and. While people enjoy computer, nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers the people exercise. America is over weight already to join the People on computers most just long to become over weight. People rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1 a local doctor, has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more. In conclusion, I think computer negative effect on. My three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family, not enjoying nature and getting less exercise. I you to be in of negative effects on people. @CAPS1's important decision is up to you. 	4	5	9
463	1	Dear local newspaper, I've heard that some people think that computers do not benefit society. But I belive they do. Computers help us learn information of al types. It's a good souce of entertainment. And last but not least, computers do not drasticly change the time we use exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Computer are a great resource in our everyday lives so why not use what we were given. Google, yahoo, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. What would we do without them. They help us figure out small things like quick and easy way to get rid of a stomache ache or a funny joke to tell at the office the next day while you in the staff room drinking coffe. They also help us when we want to know what to do when your newborn has a cough and a small sneeze you know the tough stuff. These are the kinds or things you need to know and not everyone go out to the library everytime you have a question. The information on the computers is endless why not use it from learning a new language for next vacation to @LOCATION2 to finding help for that geometry homework that you just can't understand, the computer can do it all. Entertainment is everlasting on computers from the skatebording dog on. Youtube that you can't stop laughing at to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on addictinggames.com. There will never be a dull moment. There are millions of videos and movies on youtube. There are @CAPS4 of games on the @ORGANIZATION1 alone from pacman to scrabble there's no way we'll have nothing to do. I always go on @ORGANIZATION2 to talk to family living too far to visit. Computers are one of the best soarces of entertainment, they definetly benefit society. Computers definetly do not change the way we exercise, enjoy nature or interact with family and friends. On the computer there are videos that show us new yoga move and other ways to lose those extra pounds you gained over the days. There are sites to find where to go camping and have that family vacation you have always wanted. And we always make time to go see our family and friends. Computers dont keep us hupnitized. Without a doubt computer benifit everyone's society. They re informational. The definetly entertain us all. And then don't turn us into mindless zombies so that we can't interact with other people. Computer are one of the most helpful things we have and no one should think they arn't not after reading this essay.	4	4	8
465	1	Computers, computers, computers. Who doesn't own them right? They teach hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure bull !@. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step. Cellphones, cars, telephones want! There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em? By the press of the button, all doors unlocked, by a swith the windows go down, yes, by computer. Now, how do computer's make life easier you say? Well keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats the pencils you we are all made by, the yoou know what! Machines, but programed with computer chips. Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With there everday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact. We use them everday, and hopefully they'll be around for the longest.	4	4	8
466	1	Computers have a good effect on people because they can teach people hand eye coordinating events in history and about other cultures and they are a great way to relax and just have fun. Computers teach hand eye coordinator by training your hand to go where your brain tells it to and where your eyes show it. Hand eye coordination is very important. It can help people drives it decreases reaction time and it can help people write more neatly. If it can help a driver turn his wheel faster or hit his break I think that hand eye coordination could help that driver stay out of an accident. Think of a climber trying to grab a on a mountain. He would be able to see it, grab it, and himself up quicker than before. Most people don't know things like how many soldiers were on @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or how many countries there are in the world. The internet is a great place to find out about history world other things you wan't to know A lot of americans don't know @LOCATION2 history alone world history. You can google anything you want from when the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ended to when the @LOCATION1 collapsed in @DATE1. You can also learn either interesting and useful things like food recipes the contents in paints. Or you could just be keeping up with the need on yahoo.com. Computers are a lot of fun. You can talk with friends, listen to music, play games or do all three at the same time. That's just scratching the you miss your favorite show @TIME1? There are hundreds of websites that will let you watch it for free. Did you want to hear your favorite bands new album? You can listen to it legally and free on youtube.com playlist.com and many more websites. Between learning about other cultures and just having fun, the computer can be a great for interactive with friends and family improve hand eye coordination or learn something new.	4	5	9
468	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've heard reports from both the news on @CAPS2.V. and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers. I'm not saying it's a bad thing I mean the computer has the internet which allows you to go to anything like websites and online chatting. I just think that people should get outside more often and do some outdoor things like football, basketball, baseball or if you're an adult you could get a job that doesn'@CAPS2 require a computer like for example building houses for homless people, shelters for animals, or have a job as a maitnence man, pool lifeguard, or any other job at a hotel that doesn'@CAPS2 involve a computer. You could work at a restaurant that has regular food or fast food service. Something that does'ent involve a computer. But if you can'@CAPS2 get out of the house you could do something a little different from computers video games. They maybe similar to the computer but they are something you can do on the @CAPS2.v. and it beats playing on the computer all the time.	4	4	8
470	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, This leter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computers use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you modre about it... As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors.""Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least @NUM1 minutes everyday,"" @PERSON2. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn'@CAPS1 healthy being in the house all day. A second reason @CAPS1 worry shout over- usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday. ""People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy,"" ssays health expert @PERSON1,"" however @PERCENT1 of people don'@CAPS1 because of computers."" this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for @NUM2 minutes, but the @NUM2 minutes turns into @NUM4 minutes, which @MONTH1 even turn into an hour! I know still @MONTH1 be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, @CAPS2 I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don'@CAPS1 like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. How of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. But it's not the same as spending quality time. ""Friends come and go and you and your family won'@CAPS1 live forever,"" says therapist @PERSON3"", @CAPS2 motor the best of that you have."" there won'@CAPS1 be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen. As you can see there reasons why I am concerned about people spending time on the computer. There's less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into concideration."	4	4	8
476	1	I think the computer dire a postive effect on people all over the world. You can do lots of things on the computer like an acidemic work, talk on the enernet, or even find out facts' about fam'us people you love, people computer. I think computer can benfit socity becuse computers can help you with your acidimic work, and can also talk to you friends online. One way i can benfit from using the computer by, typing my school work. But when in not doing my school work talking to my friends online. But the best thing of all is finding out information about famuse people like @PERSON1. I rember when is was doing a project on the computer and got a @NUM1 on it becuse i used the computer. That should prove that computers are very help full. Have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your ever day life. If you said no i can tell you how. You can learn about diffrent places and food. Lets say i was going to make pizza and i did not know how i would have to look on the computer how to. A professor from virgin new york tech school said that with out computers the world is nothing. @PERCENT1 of people at new york tech school agreed but @PERCENT2 did not could you immagin a world with out computers. I if the world did not have computers we would not have cell phones or even t.v. Not ever on know the cell phones or computers lets face it with out computers the world would be lost like the proffser from new york tech said. Also teenagrs would be bored becuse most teenangers do not like to go out side and if we do not have computers how will adults do there work or they will have to handwrite it. Lets be honsest some adults and kids hand writing is like chicken scrach so to say. I think computer are very helpful for everyone around the world. In closing i think the hole world should keep computers becus with out computers the world is lost, to the past paper.	4	4	8
484	1	Although most people would say the invention of a computer is a good thing, I dissagree. There are many bad things about the invention of computers, they give access to the internet. The internet has innappriate pictures and writing, unclear identification, and games. The worst of all is that on the internet, there is always unclear indentification. Although something on a social website such as @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 might say a person is fourteen years old, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 might be someone that had just been released from prison and is actually fourty years old. There is never a way to know if its safe to talk to other people on the internet. Games on the internet are also very bad. Games are one of the causes or obesity in america. Also, games on the internet cause kids to be drawn away from their families. Another reason of why games are bad is because you can become addicted to them, and stare at a computer screeen so long you get eye-strain. There are also innapropriate pictures and writing on the internet. There is bomb making websites and illegal music downloading websites. Overell, computers are for researching but aren't reliable in safety and cause obesity nad family aruements.	3	4	7
497	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are effecting the lives of many people. More and more people keep getting sucked into the amazing things that computers can do and forget all about the other more important things in life. People should be exercising, and hanging out with friends and family, computers dont even teach you that much if you really think about it. People don't even realize that computers can take away very important things in life. Fore istance, people aren't getting nearly as much exercise as they need. In this generation, more kids are overweight and obese that any other other generation. People get so caught up in what they are doing on the computer that they forget to exercise each day, or at least every other day. Computers just add to list of excuses not to do anything. People already spend way to much time watching t.v. It rots your brain and studies acually show that people are less aware and less connected to the world and the people around them. Computers are the same as t.v.'s, you say that your just going to be an for a minute and then next thing you know @NUM1 hours have already gone by. Computers @MONTH1 be exercising your brain, but they're not exercing you and that's what really counts. Even if you were on the computer doing research for a school project, the computer still wouldn't help you. Most people don't have the time to run out to the library to get the books that they need, so they just resort to the computer. That isn't the smartest idea because half of the websites that you click on or go to don't even have the correct information. You might look at it and read it, and even if it sounds good to you, that doesn't mean that it's right. Next thing you know, you have a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 on an assignment that the thought you aced. On top of getting false information, most people don't even know where to look to get the information that they're looking for. People just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter. Then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page. Then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were. People then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they don't feel like trying to get back to that page. If people just went to the library and did research the old fashion way, then they would stop to notice all the things in life that they are missing out on. People should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer. Sure you can talk to people on the computer but you can't bond with them or really see what they are feeling. It's better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change. Even if your spending time with your family or friends you're probebly thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there, so go out and do something for change, a little fresh air wouldn't kill you. You should go to an amusement park, ride some rides with your cousins, do something that will keep your mind off the computer. People don't realize it, but after spending so much time with your family, rather than your computer, you will acually notice what you have been missing out on for so long. As you can see, computers aren't helping anyone. It's either not exercing, getting false information, or not spending time with your own family! Seems to me that having computers around isn't everything that it's cracked up to be.	5	4	9
499	1	A lot of people use computers in present day. It allows family and friends to interact with eachother, research places and ideas, and lets you type a document to look neat. On the other hand, computer technology, prevents people from being active, exploring nature, and talking to family and friends in person. I want to explain to you how I feel about computers personally. I can honestly tell you that I love computers. I spend a lot of time on @CAPS3, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes don't get to see. I can even see how my cousin in @LOCATION1 is doing. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I don't totally understand, I can just hop on my laptop, search what I need, and @CAPS1!, I have my information. Then after that I can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out, see? Computer are bangin! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be time consuming. I can admit that I've spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend to much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves the @CAPS2. My mom will call him down for dinner and he'll be too engrossed in what he's doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he'll blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself. Well? How does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one. But here's the thing. I like my laptop. I'm addicted to @CAPS3, But, I still play sports, I talk to my family, and I even like to take walks through the words or on the beach. I neutral, like @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientist say computers have positive effect on people. Some experts say they're concerned computers have a negative effect on people. @PERSON1 says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world. But we don't need to spend @CAPS6 of our time on them. I hope you understand my point on this issue.	4	5	9
501	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 you agree with what I'm trying to tell about people use the computer more than exsersise? Well first more and more people use computers but how does it benifit them. Secondly, they are spending to much time on their computer than exercising. Finally they spend less and less time with their family and being active. First more and more people use computers but how does that benifit them. Computers is just a adicting technology that makes you lazy and slow. Does using the computer @CAPS6 you with problems your having with your family...@CAPS11! Well I know this from ex perience. My mom is always on face book and I hate it I figure she loves the computer more then @CAPS7 do you want your kids to think that about you? As the days pass by her time on the computer increase and @CAPS1 sitting there needing @CAPS6 on homework and i'm thinking @CAPS2 @CAPS3 YOU @CAPS4""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS9. See i was just thiking that cause @CAPS3 I said that it's a rap for @CAPS7 but @CAPS1 just trying to say this computer went benifit anyone @CAPS11 way. Second I want to inform the @CAPS12 @CAPS13 paper is that people are spending more time on the computer than exsercising. The obeast rate has been higer than it ever been. I believe by @PERCENT1! COME ON this is @CAPS14! people come home by @CAPS15.K and other fast food @NUM1 go on the computer and eat. Over time you get bigger and your apperence change. You began to look sloppy and nobody wants you. You look back and regret doing what you did. Finally you spend less and less time with you family. This causes you grow apart from your family your kids pick up bad habbits and do the opposite of what you want them to do. This tells @CAPS7 that the computer is just @CAPS11 good at all. In conclusion I informed you on why I dislike computers. They @CAPS4'@CAPS5 benift you. Makes you lazy and keeps you from you kids. So do oyou the local @CAPS13 paper agree? "	4	4	8
516	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many oportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it @MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even taken, where a student can be taugh through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. E-mail and I @CAPS3. These methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is becaus if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally this is not the case. Usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a persons life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me.	4	4	8
522	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I have herad that you guys are deciding whether or not computers have a negative or positive impact on the society. In my opinion, I believe computers have a very negative impact not only to adults but mostly to students too. Computers in general can be distracting, very dangerous, and give people less time to excercise. Computers in total do not have a bad impact on people. Some people say computers are not distracting, well I say they are. Computers have varies websites such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework. @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are websites where you can chat with friends and see peoples pictures. These websites can be very interupptive when trying to do something important. For example, I am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying. If I had to choose between doing homework or chatting on @CAPS1, I would choose @CAPS1. But if you actually think about, are these websites benefitting anybody. Homework and studying can actually benefit you in doing better can benefit you in your studies and ferther on in your life. In total, I believe computers are a big distarction. When people go on the computer they go on without worrying a little bit. They don't know the danger behind it. These dangerous computer have people on it called online predators. Online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others. One website in specific that I herad was very harmful is myspace. This website is even more dangerous then @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Myspace is like @CAPS1 in a way but very dangerous. For instance, my mom told me that one of her friends daughter had a myspace and became friends with a guy she didn't know. Of course she didn't worry because according to her he seemed a nice guy so she gave him her number. Good thing her mom saw it, otherwise something bad would happend. He ended up being an online predator. Lastly, computer can make people unhealthy. People who stare on computers non-stop can make them not exercise. For example, not playing sports such as soccer, vollyball, and tennis. This is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy. This is why computers can make you not exercise. In conclusion, computers can have a very negative effect on people. It can be very distracting, dangerous, and unhealthy for not exercising. In total, computers cannot have a bad impact on people.	5	4	9
547	1	Dear @CAPS1, I @CAPS2 that computers has benefits to society. First, it gives and teaches you social skills. Next, computers can help you learn new things online. Finally, computers also teach you hand-eye coordination. In the following you will see why I @CAPS2 computers have its benefits to the society. First, computers has its benefits to society because it can teach or give you the social skills you need. On a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends. Therefore, you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country. Also, you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you in the moment. So as you can see, Computers has its benefits because it can teach you social skills. Next the benefits it has to society is people can learn things online. for example, you can learn how to use a computer if you don't already know how. Also, you could play online learning games for free or buy a @CAPS3 with more options for learning. Another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it. So as you can see, Computers benefit society because you can learn all types of things online. Finally, computers how its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination. for example, you can find all types of games using hand-eye coordination using the mouse and keyboard. Also if you just want time to go by you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with other and playing games. Believe it or not, you can find boat loads of jobs that uses a computer for any of these also as you can see computers have its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination and gives you some free-time entertainment. In conclusion, computers have its benefits to the social community. First, it helps you learn your social skills. Next, you can learn about any subject online for free if your not the one paying the internet bill finally, it benefits you by teaching you hand-eye coordination. So as you can see, I @CAPS2 that computers benefits society in plenty of ways.	4	4	8
556	1	"Dear newspaper, Computers are everywhere in our nation. We have them at home, at @ORGANIZATION1 or at our work. Many people believe that computers are bad for our health or we don’t spend enough time with our family. But I disagree. Computers teach hand-eye coordination let us learn about faraway places, and also let us allow to chat online with other people. Have you ever had trouble with hand-eye coordination? Sometimes mine is ridiculous! But when i get on a computer it gets to be much better. Experts say that @PERCENT1 more people with hand-eye coordination have improved by working with computer. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS1 students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand-eye coordination already."" I agree with these experts too. So many people nowadays that have a computer have passed their hand-eye coordination test! When I grow up and soon get out of high @ORGANIZATION1 I want to travel all over the world. But first I want to be educated on where I go. That is why computers are so helpful. I can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where I can learn all about the places I want to visit. @CAPS2 time @CAPS1 parents told me we were going to @LOCATION1 for the day. So the night before I did a bunch of research of different shops, museums, and places to eat. The computer helped me so much that if we didn't have @CAPS2 then i don't know where would go. President @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS2 time when i had a big meeting in @LOCATION3 I had no knowledge about it. So I logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture, language, and much more. I dont know what I would do if I didn't have a computer."" I love talking to @CAPS1 friends. But once I'm home none of @CAPS1 friends are around me, so I have nobody to talk to. If I also don't have the phone available then that makes it even worse.But, if I go on the computer then I can talk to bunch of @CAPS1 friends. I can go onto @CAPS1 webcam to see who I am talking to or I can go onto another website to get an instant message. I love talking online because ont of @CAPS1 best friends in the whole word moved down to @LOCATION2 so I don't get to talk to her too much. But if I go to the instant message website then I can talk to her as much as I want. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people sold in a survey that they have someone they talk to over the internet. So I say the computer is important in our society. It helps complete a number of tasks. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and it even allows people to talk to friends and family online. So I dont think computers are bad fo us or our health. I think they are important and needed."	5	5	10
564	1	"The question is does computers have a positive effect on society? Yes computers definetly have a positive effect on society. Computers teach hand-eye coordiantion, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allows people to talk to other people online. Computers put a positive effect of people. First, Computers teach people hand-eye coordination. I mean, computers help people learn how to use there eyes and hands t the same time. A survey conducted by @PERSON3 shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have better hand-eye coordiantion that use computers them that don't. Proffessor @PERSON1 says ""people that use a computer are much more coordinated than any othe person, it is a great discovery."" You @MONTH1 be thinking that s computer would make you less coordianted BUT, computers really help hand-eye coordination in people. In conclusion the more you get to learn hot to use a computer the better hand-eye coordinated you will be. Second, computers allow people to be able to learn about far away places and people. i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway @CAPS3 without paying a fortune in money to go the @CAPS3. I remember the time @CAPS4 my mom and dad was going to go to @CAPS1 to see a lot of the landmarks and my uncle came to my house with a brand new computer and my parents ended up staying home and saved themselves a large amount op money. Famous explorer @CAPS2 smome says ""before I go anywhere I always google it on my computer to learn about life, climent, etc, on the @CAPS3. I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that it would be a better experience to go to the @CAPS3 but, it is really expensive to go to very faraway countries. In conclusion, computer can help you save money and help you learn. Third, computers lets people talk to other people online. i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends. A survey done by @ORGANIZATION1. Shows that @PERCENT1 of people talk to other people over those websites. aAmous social worker @PERSON2 says ""@CAPS4 people use these websites it helps them with their vocabulary and social abilities."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking those websites are dangerous is at, viris software can prevent danger. In conclusion social abilities are up with computers. Lastly, computers teach people about faraway places, help social abilities and learn hand-eye coordination. Computers can help society and learning so help the growth technology today!!!"	4	4	8
570	1	"Your spending too much time on the computer your mom and dad well out. You relize it's time toget off and go outside. You spend about @PERCENT1 more or less on the computer each day, but @CAPS1 good reasons. You can multi task on it, you can talk to friends and family you haven't seen or talked to forever, and lastly, you can spend time outside as well as in side. @CAPS5 you were smart you would not listen to those experts Have you ever heard of the word multi tasking? It's were you can do more than on thing at a time, @CAPS1 example you car read and talk, or text and talk, or walk and be reading something. You have all these things you condo. Another example is when your on the computer you can listen to music and talk to friends or read. What you can even do is you can talk to your friends, listen to music, and do homework. What i mean when i say homework is when you have to type up an easy or something. The fourth and final examples is that about @PERCENT2 of us can multi task @CAPS2 of my friends told me that they just bought a laptop with a built in camera, @NUM1 now they can talk to people they haven't seen in a long time. ""I haven't seen my sister since she moved to california @NUM2 years ago, so i thougnt I would use the @CAPS3 on my laptop to se her."" @CAPS4 a mother of the @ORGANIZATION1. A computer or laptop can be good @CAPS1 talking to friends or family you haven't seen in a long time. Anouther from a student say's."" @CAPS5 you were smart, and understanding you would now why everyones on the computer so much"". When your on the computer and your friends start to talk to you about things you understand why, you ussaly don't see your friends unless its lunch"" or before class. Computers help talking to friends move easier than writing letters or waiting @CAPS1 calss to get out. You get off the bus and you relize that it's pur sunshine out. You decide to do some or all of your homework now so you can go out and play. Your outside @CAPS1 about a few hours. When you come in its around @NUM2:00 pm. You eat dinner and ya just want to unwind from the days gigantic adventure so you go on the computer. Ypu can go on the computer around like wild animals outside too. Only responside kids plan their time acordingly In conclusion it is important that you now that computers are good @CAPS1 multi tasking, talking to friends and family you havent seen in along time, and that you can go outside as well a stay inside now is the time to call, @CAPS5 you were smart you wouldn't listen to these experts."	4	4	8
571	1	"Computers today are much different from computers back then. They help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I think that computers help people in many ways, like teaching a hand-eye coordination. They're useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they haven't seen in a long time and computer skills are required in the real world. Hand-eye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination. This helps because if one has to type a @NUM1-page report, then one who has good hand-eye coordination, or typing skills, ""can finish a report in @NUM2 minutes or so. If one has poor hand-eye coordination, well that @NUM2 minute report will take about a few hours. No one likes to be sitting infront of a computer for a few hours. Everyone has friends and best friends that they talk to every day, But what happens if that friend moves out-of-town, out-of-state or possibility out-of-country? They might be forgotten or never seen from again. Well, thanks to technology and the advancement of computers, people can chat online on @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, myspace or facebook. They can catch upon things, check out what's new, even see posted pictures of them. The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away. Who wouldn't want to talk to friends or family that haven't been heard from? Lastly, having computer skills is very, very, very important in the real world. Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programer for the state, or they can create websites for their own jobs. Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or @CAPS2 shows. That's big money there. No wonder schools have computer classes. It's to get students to have a good background of the computer. Computers are not that bad. They teach hand-eye coordination, lets people talk to other people online and can get people great jobs. Many educated people would agree that computers doesn't have a positive effect on people."	4	5	9
587	1	More and more people use computers in fact about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T has computers, everyone uses them. I think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing, jobs, and schoolwork. This is why I think having a computer is a good things what do you think? As I was say computers are good for emailing, even I.ming. lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is. You can just push that power button and tree to your coach asking what time you need to be at the feild. Also theres I.Ming, its wen you can talk to your friends online its a great way to comunicate and meet new people. Emailing is great, its so hi-tect you can email one of your family members who live thousand miles away from you. I once did that my aunt's lisa was in florida and i asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches and she did, they were eye catching. Next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs. In todays world everything is ran by computers for example each registers. A.T.M. and car are ran off of computers. So having it for a job is great. Lets your tells you to fax over a copy can do it the computer within a minute i know my dads job requires of he keeps it all to his witch on his desktop on his laptop. This is why most jobs have computers. Do you are one? Lastly, school was computers . For example my teacher on his computer atendence, homework and . If he didn't have that, he would be lost. Its also good for the kids too. Every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that. Did you know is a program were you can look at your grades and missing assignments? It's call power school. Computers are great for school. I think every one should have one. So what do you think about them? Are they amazing or what? I think are very helpful because you can use them for emailing, working, and school work. If it wasn't for computers we would really know as much as we do now. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T have them. Computers are gonna help you through life alot, welcome to the real world.	5	4	9
608	1	Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1 my name is @CAPS2, @PERSON1 and I think that this idea based on why people need computer is a good statement/ @CAPS3. My @CAPS4 oppinon is that same say people use their computers so much they don’t yet exercise. When that is not true do to the fact that computers have. Programms on how to watch your weight. Stocks and etc also Technology helps people around the world on websites, programs such names as to video chat, @CAPS5.com for instant messaging. on the way teen stuff like computers help people for on video chatting, emailing people their rezemates to jobs on why and how their based. On showing people their recent jobs. And giving details on showing people reading this article is that technology of computers also help @CAPS6 save. Most reasons we need tech equipment is that people use it on fields such as the navy, @CAPS6, dealships, all over the world industry. Why is that good well my point of view is that business need that to order their stocks for store carriers and more. For @CAPS6 on field to use for @CAPS7 sean, pregnacy, pulse radar's and more. And on the negative point of those side of the readers are based on the mostly that people get addict to technology when the truht is that people really need technology look around you and everything in this world has mostly been made by technology and. the @CAPS8 is that people should agree. that computers help people, speak, @CAPS9, email, lives, help find family, friends, give directions, so on my point of view @CAPS9 tel your dean @CAPS1 and readers that interacting with technology. Is a good way nto control ways on how or what you do in the computers do to that in my way I make sites audio and interesting Technology can allows people on ways to help people. Find and create ways to making money or interesting positive out comes out of using person in this world goes in and thru out tech equip. These days, and to the people who have read this article should pass this story on to people who take technology on negative terms and to help them think about it positive.	4	3	7
631	1	Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are good. You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that we	3	3	6
640	1	Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Survey’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality.	4	3	7
654	1	Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.	5	5	10
664	1	"Technology has been growing and changing rapidly. Just look at apples new @CAPS1, a desent rized touch screen computer. Computers have been rapidly changing too. But I think that @CAPS2 need to cut down on the use of electronics. Being one the computer for a long time and large amount of time can damage your eyesight, give you arthrightus and takes time @CAPS5 of exersizing; one of the thing manhy @CAPS2 need to do. Many @CAPS2 have been spending has too long on the computer, although it can be very useful it can also be very damaging to your eyesight many people spent large amounts of time staring at the computer screen. If you stair at something for too long it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because your trying @CAPS5 your eye lens. Also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes. The light coming on to your eyes is like staring at the sun but not quit as damaging. The sun will instatntly damage your eyes while overtime a computer slowly damges your eyesight. If your eyesight is already damaged a computer will worsen it. The more time spent on a computer the more you damage your vision. Since your eyes are already bad you might think ""well they can't get any worse."" @CAPS5 the truth is they can not only is the light and the amount of time spent during a being onthe computer damaging to people with @NUM1 vision but even more damaging to people without. can be genetic or common to people who constently their knuckles. It can also be common to people who spend exeessive amount of time on the computer. AIM is very popular to people of all ages. Its a way to instantly gossip or chat with freinds. But it takes alot of typing. Typing to long or to much can cause your fingers to lock up and it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain. if this constenity happens to you you could be a canidat for arthrightus. No letting your fingers take a break can also be one of the reasons your fingers hurt, if you never let them take a break they can also lock up and it can be very painful. You should spend less time on the computer if you don't want artrightus. Because of all this new technology less @CAPS2 go outside and play or hit the gym and exersize. That @MONTH1 be way many @CAPS2 are over weight. Being on the computer for to long takes away time you could use to exersize or get some fresh air."	4	5	9
666	1	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people who use them. Because they teach hand eye coordination, give us the ability to learn about far away people and places and allow us to chat online with people. @CAPS3 first reason of why I think computers have a positive affect on people is that they teach hand eye coordination. For example, we need to use our hand-eye coordination skills when we type to @CAPS2 the letters. This helps us increase our Hand eye coordination because it helps us think about what letters we are typing, @CAPS2 the letters on the keyboard, and push them. Also when we type long passages it increase our hand eye coordination becaue we get used to wrighting the long paragraphs and we become more familiar with where the letters are on the keyboard and our speed increases,which means we can get more work done in a shorter time. Believe it or not @PERSON1 free of the @ORGANIZATION1 hospital took a survey that showed @NUM1 people who type essays instead of wrighting them by hand, have a greater hand eye coordination skill. Computers also allow us to learn about far away people and places. For example computers make it easier to reaserch far away people and places. Useing a computer can help us understand and learn about people and places withought a trip to the library. Also computers allow us to @CAPS2 us to @CAPS2 more info about recent events that have just around the world. Also computers make it faster to reserch topics because looking for a book in those big libraries can be stressfull, not to mention dificult. Also informat on a computer can never be checked out or not availible like library books. Lastly you have information right at our fingerries so you will never have to leave youre house, @CAPS3 last reason is that computers allwo us to chat online with other people. This can help us because it allows us to talk to friends and family from around the world. Also it helps us talk to our parents if theyre away or if you're on a camping trip. Chating on a computer is a great way to make friends with people you dont know and block people you dont want talking to you. So in a sence you can be in controll of your friendships and who youre friends with. Computers are the greatist advance in technology sence the wheel and they have helped so many people.	4	4	8
668	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the conterversies between having computers. Computers are the center of technology. I can't imagine a world without them. Though having a computer @MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games, computers teach more and help children as well. I know for your company, having no computer would be a nightmare. It gives education to not only children, but adults as well. First of all, computers are proven to be the second best source of education, behind school, along with the best source of information. Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds. Not only are there websites. these are @CAPS1's with online tutors or just work. Computers provide practically anthing you need. For work, adult use. computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic. The technology of a computer is farther than any other item. Without a computer life would be much more difficult. Instend of just sending an email, mail would have to be sent out. Most information would have to from brooks. In fact even the internet has books to buy and read. I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends, but children need to be social, @CAPS2 it weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities. Lastly. computers have documents and it is the best way to type. Your company can definetly agree that without typing documents life would be a mess. Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other access to typing is a type writer. Types writers can't save anything, delete and do half the work computers do. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel @CAPS2 you couldn't use a computer. In conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. Without computers life would be difficult and stressful. Computers give education stand information to everyone. The technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life, easier. I couldn't even imagire no documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my decision. I hope you chose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time	5	5	10
683	1	Do you ever have time to read? Do you ever spend time with your family? Or do you ever have time to go outside? Well, if you don't, it's because you spend to much time on the computer. Computers are bad for society. And I will show you why. There are many great activities you can do such as reading a book. Instead of reading on the computer, read a novel, you can ask your parents to drive you to the library. I understant that if you need to do research you can do it on the computer but in the library there are all sorts of books such as fiction, nonfiction, science books and many more. Every intelligent citizen would @CAPS1 that computer @MONTH1 have wrong information. I remember when I was doing a project on @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 music. I used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her. I went to the library and checked out a book on her and it said that a woman killed her actually. In addition books help you get more accurate facts. Every caring, loving human cares about spending time with their family. How can you spend more time with your family? Well, you can visit some cousins on the weekends. Your family can make parties. I recall having a party for my baby brother's baptism, everyone came. I got to see my aunts, and cousins that I didn't see in years. I understand that if you have a far away relative you would use the computer to chat with them or see them on webcam, but why not take a vacation were they live and go by car, that would bring the family even closer. I @CAPS1 what that is like. My family lives in @LOCATION2 and I visit them every year. We have family reunions, maybe your family can do that too. As a result, family is important, so don't let the computer ruin yours. Do you ever go outside anymore? Is the computer getting in your way? You have to check your e-mail, reply, go on your @CAPS4, its hungry, you have to do your daily activities. What about your health? Getting fresh air can be good. These are many great things you can do outside. For example, you can jump rope, go to the park, go swimming, play in the snow and many more. I remember the time my cousin came over and we went to the park. We stayed these until the park closed. It was very entertaining. Every citizen in @LOCATION1 wants to be healthy. Going outside can help you, run through the woods, or even jump roping is outside and excersizing. In addition just going outside can do more. Now is the time. Why wait another minute? You can either be all alone on the computer or be outside, or be with your family, even the library isn't lonely. Computers are a bad habit, even though we might need them, its better safe, then sorry to do it the old fashion way.	5	5	10
696	1	Dear editor of The @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good ideas for our community. If the library's closed and a students needs information, you can look it upon the internet. Also, you can talk with your friends if your phones not working. Computers can help people learn about the latest news if the television is getting pixecl. First of all, computers can help with research alot. Let's say it's ranning healthy, your car? out of gas and you need to go to the library before it closes. Just be easier to go on the computer and find a research site about your topic; no gas wasted, no sopping wet doing just you in a robe sipping hot choclate on the computer. Next, you can talk to friends all the way in another country without having to pay extra for a long distance call. And if yo udon't have unlimited minutes and you went to talk with someone for a long time, you'd be wasting valuable minutes and money! This is where computers come in. You can just open a chat window and talk away, just like that. Finally, you can look up the latest news and information on a search program, like @ORGANIZATION1. If your television broke and it'd take a week to fix, what if something happened that you needed to know about you could just go on the internet and look it up. Thank you for reading my ideas, editor. I hope you'll choose my article to post in your newspaper when the time comes.	4	4	8
707	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you because I believe that people in the @LOCATION1 over use computers these days. I think that instead of home on your lazy and playing farmville and pets on facebook you should get out more. I think that you should @CAPS8 the gym and work out you should @CAPS8 out to the park or have family fun night with your kids (@CAPS1 you have any) The last thing I think you should @CAPS7 is @CAPS8 have a little ""@CAPS2"" time for example take your self somewere nice (you'll about time in a second) @DATE1 all you've done is sit home playing farmville and other games and what not you probably get really fastly and you eating right? well @CAPS1 @CAPS3.... boy you gained some pounds of the @DATE1 and you look you need to get your self to a gym. from sitting on your while on the @CAPS9 every day you any calories or fat @CAPS3 when you eat all your doing is gaining weight. and @CAPS4 you probably don't want to. @CAPS7 you have a family? Well @CAPS1 you @CAPS7 I think that taking a family trip to the park would be fun or going to @ORGANIZATION1 would be a fun way @CAPS3 you can get your hands off those keys and your head with your kids. Also you should make other nightfamily fun night and play games and hang out with family on family fun night you can play characles or a board game. (as long as you don't have a in your house) The last my favorite one is ""@CAPS4"" Time. During ""@CAPS4"" Time you can take your self shopping out to lunch/dinner you even take a map the whole point of ""@CAPS4"" Time is that You @CAPS7 NOT @CAPS8 ON THE @CAPS9!! you need to relax and just take a brake. Well those are my suggestions to you. @CAPS3 now its your turn to jump on out of virtual world and put your head back in reality."	4	4	8
711	1	Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?	5	5	10
734	1	Dear newspaper, This year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online. This has made me believe that computors are not beneficial. Computors are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits. Plus, websites and some applications are dangerous. Also, they are very addictive. Computors have a bad effect on people. To begin, computors enforce bad habits. For example, some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people. Some kids @MONTH1 join in on the cyber bulling because other kids are kids @MONTH1 give in to peer pressure because they want to get accepted by their peers so badly. Furthermore, someone @MONTH1 agree to meet someone they don't know. That can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were. Recently, I read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they online. Most people found at that it was not the person they thought they were. Finally, the computor enforces bad habits because people @MONTH1 send someone some questionable pictures to someone else. As I mentioned before, when the police officer came to our school he talked about this. He said that people were sending pictures of them that were innapropiate to other people. Those other people would send it around and in the end it was a horrible mess. I'm sure if computers didn't have a giant effect on people, this would not be as big of a problem as it is. Computors do not only cause bad habits, but they are also dangerous. I'm sure if you listen to the news you will hear stories about child predators. I think that is one huge problem. If computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem. In addition, computors are dangerous because kids @MONTH1 choose to make bad decisions because they do not knew. For example, many kids who are on myspace or facebook have not talked to their parent or guardian about internet safety. Or maybe even their parent or guardian isn't monitering them to make sure they are safe online. In conclusion, the computer is dangerous because feelings could be hurt because of myspace, facebook, a blog, a video, or maybe even more. As an illustration, one time one the news I heard a story about a girl who was tensed on the internet. She felt so bad that she committed sucide. I found that horrible. A person should never comitt sucide, especially because some other person could not be nice. To sum up, computors are very dangerous. Computors are also addictive. To start off, it makes you spend less time with your family. (not finished!!!)	5	5	10
744	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I @CAPS1 believe that using computers has a benefit to the community. I believe this because using computers helps with research, jobs, and staying in town with people. First and foremost, the use of computers will tribute to better research. Most @CAPS2 dont have textbooks about @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 at home with them so they rely on the internet. When @PERSON2 gave the class a parket, I didn't know what some of the words meant. So i logged into my laptop and went on google, within seconds the definitions wore popping onto my screen like pop rocks. After I found out what the words meant, I finished my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet I don't know how long it would have taken. Equally important, using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs. @PERCENT1 of today's jobs in @LOCATION1 require some kind of computer work. some jobs require quick typers. some people type as fast as cheetah runs. Some jobs require people using @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 - Computers are a necessity to get a well - paying job. Lastly, using computers will open a gateway communication @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, etc are a few of the many ways to communicate online. if one of my friends doesn't have a phone, they most likely have a @CAPS7. @CAPS7 gives me a way to talk to, @CAPS11 photos with and leave videos for my friends. One @CAPS12 @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and I were all going to work on our @PERSON1 project. @PERSON3's phone was taken away so the only way I could talk to her was on @CAPS7. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has a @CAPS7, @CAPS8, of @CAPS9? To @CAPS17, I hope you enjoyed reading about how using computers helps with research, applying for a job, and communicating with family and friends please @LOCATION1, @CAPS18 this in the Newspaper so all residents of @LOCATION1 will agree with me.	5	4	9
753	1	Dear, local newspaper I agree with @CAPS1 that computers are not good because of different reasons such as putting a person's health in danger for not excersicing much or making people spend more time on a computer than interact with family & friends and sadly also it causes people to change there attitudes and ways of being. But if you wanna hear more than you will just have to read on. There are plenty consequences that people have for spending too much time on the computer, such as people getting addicted to watching certain things or addicted to watching certain things or simply get addicted to the computer itself. Plenty of people now a days, have to wear glasses and probably most of them have to wear them because of too much computer, and it must be really bad having to wear glasses the rest of your life. Also too much computer is bad for a person's health because they're giving more time to a computer than spending that time excercising. I believe people should spend more time interacting with family & friends because it can also make you lose your friends and/or family because your not giving them the time they need & friends and family are one of the most important things in a person's life. And last but not least. too much computer can change a person such as changing their manners, the way they speak, and there attitides. Well I've giving you reasons why I think computers are not good such as, putting health in danger, changing a person's life, and causin them to lose family & friends now is up to you the rest.	4	4	8
761	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a usefull tool when doing a school report or something to that effect but, @CAPS2 we really need thoes computers. When using a computer for a school project @CAPS3 can be a hassel. One of many problems people are fased with while using a computer are freazing, when doing a project and your computer frezz's @CAPS3 can be verry time consumming. Another problem is pop up's, pop up's can couse virouses, and when you computer gets a virous, @CAPS3 leads to becoming very slow. Witch leads us to are next problem slowness, when a computer becomes slow @CAPS3 is verry a digital. There are several problems and risks that come with a computer. One health problem is that you can become a hermet and stay inside all day because your too attached to the computer. Another problem is that you can become verry obease because your not getting any physical exersise. One risks of using a computer is that you could end up getting an fassebook, @CAPS1, or myspase, and meating some one who is protending to be some one there not and get abducted by a molester! There are other alternations you could make instead of using an computer. One alternation is that you could go to the local library and cheak out books on your topick that your wanting information on. Another alternation is to ask teachor if she/he could leand you a class text book. But the main aternation is computer to old fashon books! So now @CAPS3's your choice,""@CAPS2 we realy need computers or can we live with out them?"" @CAPS3's your choice!"	4	4	8
765	1	Dear editor, I beleve that people should have computers, The resons are it dosen't take @NUM1 days to email. You can learn about faraway places. Also you can talk to people around the world. After looking at these detail most people are likly to agree. Firstly it dosent take @NUM1 days to email you can email someone and it takes five seconds to get to the other person. While regular mail takes @NUM1 day to a week to get to another person. When you email some one and then the email you back it saves the and government money. Email is much fasters than the mall or I like to call it snail mail. Another reson is that you would be able to learn about diffrent contrys faraway and near. Would you be able to about @LOCATION1 from you living rooms without computers. No you wouldnt't. Without computers would you be able to learn about the earth quake in chile. No you wouldent. Compters are modern day telivision for kids. Lastly you can talk to people on the computer there is many ways to talk to people like facebook, myspace, aim, and vidio chat you don't have to call some one on the @CAPS1 when you can jus vidio chat with them. In conusion computers are good. You can email fast. You can learn about foreinge contrys in you living room. You can also chat with people online. I think computers are good what about you.	4	3	7
802	1	Dear local newspaper, The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society. I used to think they didn't benefit to society but now I think they do. I think this because, one good place to get information, two we live in a technological advanced society, and three you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world. so do computers really benefit to our society? Computers are a valuable resorce for me when I need to get information. For example, in my recent project in social studies class I need to go on the computer to get information on the subject. Also if you need facts on something and you can't go to the libary the computer has the same information. Also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store. The computer is and always will be a great source of information. In the @DATE1 technology is a huge part of society. For example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card. Now we havethin and small portable computers. So knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the @DATE1. So are you going to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch. For example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket. But if you go on a website like facebook you can talk for free. Also another way to chat with people is by A.I.M. Another free way to talk to people. What same person wouldnt want to talk to their friends and family acroosthe worl, for free? The reasons I have given you are valid reasons with deatails. Technology is like a train are you going to live it.	4	4	8
806	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion about computers is good. I think that they can help people with what they need. People can also also contact other people. All computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it. Computers help teachers, students, employees, and parents. They aren't always for just helping. Computers can also be used for amusement. Games, music, and videos are always on the internet. Contacting other people is also a great reason why computers aren't bad. People can always have an e-mail for business and friends. Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all websites that people can contact others. Having a computer isn't always bad. When you do a story for the newspaper does it come out hand written? You also use the computer to do work. Computers aren't always bad. People have to learn to just limit their time. They can always be a positive affect on people when they need something. Information on anything is always on the internet. Computers have been used for decades and I think they will be used for many many more. Back then people used computers mostly for work. Now people of all ages can use it for all different kinds of things.	3	3	6
810	1	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I belive that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communication with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or videochat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends. Computers are great.	4	4	8
821	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I beleive, myself if, that computers are extreemly important to our society in this day and age. Computers help people talk with people. Online, and keep in touch with family and friends. Secondly, I think that computers are important is because they help with learning, even online schooling. Lastly, computers just help for the need of entertainment for people. Computers are one of the most used tools on the planet. Almost every family has one, some people even have more than @NUM1. Let's face it, there are many people traveling around the world, just trying to make a decent living for their families. Computers help them keep in touch, wheather it's by e-mailing them, or even video chat. This makes people happy, and still keeps them informed about what their family members, or friends are up to. For some people, it can re-unite family, by someone searching, I don't know, maybey their long-lost brother, or something. Computers keep families togetherm and you might just got a little surprise every now and again! My we should keep computers because we. Lastly, computers can just be plain fun! Maybe you're looking for some funny videos, just go on and search,""funny videos"", and it will keep you busy for a while. I know that I enjoy downloading music, too, so why should it be any different for other people? If there is a song going through your head, just look it up and I'm sure you'll find what you are looking for. You @MONTH1 be cooking and need a recipie for something, I am sure you're computer is more than willing to tell you whatever you please. All right, so, computers are one of the most important tools, of this world that we live in today. We depend on computers for many things, like keeping in touch with family, helping people learn things, and provide entertainment, just to name a few. Computers can help with countless things."	5	4	9
829	1	Computers are an amazing technology to life. It'@CAPS1 amazing because the computer helps lots of people and jobs. The people it helps are kids in school to look up an area they need to find for a question on a worksheet. Also the jobs it helps us the police, @CAPS1.W.A.T and the @ORGANIZATION1. It helps the police and @CAPS1.W.A.T to find where people are and where they'll be. The @ORGANIZATION1 uses computers to locate where they will attack or defend. if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't of found @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The bad thing about computers are hackers and people that wont get off their computers. They are obssesed with the computer and they are so obssesed they sleep with the computer. That'@CAPS1 the parents fault. Those are the only bad things about computers. They get people fat an lazy because they only want to be on the computer. The computer also has good ways to reconnect with family and friends over the years you haven't seen them. The computer controlls lots of things like the nuclear bomb, security, secret-files, satalites, all of @CAPS5.A.@CAPS1.A. and more. They control life in the major part. People shouldn't be concerned about kids that sit there next to a computer all day because it'@CAPS1 the person'@CAPS1 fault, they ruined their lifes and the parent'@CAPS1 fault manly for not controlling their kid with staying away from the computer or the parents not signing them up for any sport. It ruines their life by having no friends at school an all they do is go straight for the computer. It'@CAPS1 an ashame to the father that use to be the cool kid, make fun of the nerds and get into fights every month. Then the father looks at his son an relises his son is a nerd and lives by a computer, then the father tryes to help the son and somewhat works out. Then the father keeps trying, thats good parenting to try to step it right when the child starts to go straight to the computer. Not the other parents that let their son/daughter only use the computer. Those are my opinions on computers of the good an bad ideas.	4	4	8
838	1	Dear Newspaper writers, I belev that difrent web sites have difrent effeks on people. For exam pull @ORGANIZATION1 has news about what is going on in the world. Other websites all difrent types of games on it could be bad for some people because some of the games are not vary apropreit. Most edicatinal web sites are ment fo help people learn. One person can learn so much with a computer. You can buy and sell a iturn that you own an get many all on one web site. A computer can be used for many difrent perpests.	2	3	5
856	1	When you are using technology usually it is work related. A computer is used for work to write essays, make power points, and research, when people use them for facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, and other chat live oovoo and websites it is more for their pleasure. I only go on facebook when I am checking my schedule for hockey, most kids use it for talk. Then there is oovoo & online video chat used for talking with friends but why not just callem'up. When I think of facebook or oovoo, or even myspace it makes me think of inapropriate pictures kids, and adults post. I think that is very unhumane and that is very dangerous to post ot because once it's out there you'll never get it back. For instance I am always outsided hanginaround when it's warm out, during winter I can understand going on facebook, but during the @DATE1 there is no need just go outside and have fun. Kids wonder why they gain weight we'll if you'de get off your computer, and quit eating twinkies then you'll notice you just have to be active. some kids parents don't really give a flying faldoodle what their kids do all day. They don't care if their kid is @NUM1 lbs. at the age of @NUM2. They don't care if their kids are sitting on the computer eating all-day. If i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato I would but I never go on the computer unless it is for homework. I used the computer just @TIME1 I typed up all of my homework except for my math. I didn't play one game, I didn't check email go on the internet or anything I just worked my hardest and got it done. I conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing, using it repeatedly and not exercising is. A computer shouldn't need to be used for pleasure it's not created to do so it's created to keep your life simpler. People pay money to buy a expensive computer and motem and all that expensive technological accesories, to make their lives much simpler not anywhere in thes essay did I say to play games because it's not. Playing games can be done outside, it doesn't have to be inside, and definately doesn't have to be on a computer. To make everyones life easier kids, get off your lazy butts, get off the twinkies, and stop playing on the computer. 	5	5	10
859	1	The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inabilty to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind @MONTH1 be racing but the body sits unmoving, @CAPS1 activity is being done. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same. Also, computers are indoors, so the true world is chielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to onlypretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?	6	6	12
880	1	Dear, Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 @PERCENT2 of the people would agree that computers are useful and by having them they help ability to learn about faw away place. They also, allow people to talk to other people online. Lastly, computers are importat @CAPS2 people that work with them. there are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society. Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about faw away places. Sometimes people, dont know when they want to leave the country. With a computer you can organize it all. Somoe people like my family, like to go visit their familys in other places, @CAPS2 example, once my mom told me we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 to go visit our family she told me she already got the tickets on the computer. I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful @LOCATION1 is. Some people like to see new and beautiful places. Such as , @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION4. Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online. Most people have myspace and that allows kids my age to keep in touch. Also, facebook that you can and people that you probly havent seen in a long time. @CAPS2 exsample, one time I was looking aroung facebook and found my old bestfriend @PERSON1. I was so happy cause when she moved I thought i would never talk to her again. I am @PERCENT1 positive that everyone in this world has a yahoo you could find people really quikck and talk to them. Would you belive that there is so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer. Such as scientists they all have to have computers or else they wouldnt be able to invient all the great things they make. Also, secretaries they have asign dates @CAPS2 their bosses. @CAPS2 exsample, a secretary @CAPS2 doctor has to be able to give and to change appointments. Lastly, students that go to school and most importantly collage with no computers, they wont be able to do their homework. Most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people. @CAPS2 the reasons that they give the ability to learn about faw away places, allow people to talk to other people online. Computers are very important to people who work with them.	5	5	10
885	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I just heard that people are spending too much time on computers than with their families and friends. No @CAPS1 is not true just listen to the reasons why in a computer you can find people that you'r looking for. Also @CAPS1 can always help you on something that you need help on and you can do different kinds of activities. If you keep on reading you are going to see all the tipical reasons why I think that people are not spending much time on computers than with their families. (@NUM1) @CAPS2 reason why I think that people are not spending much time on computerr is because, the computer can help you look for a family member that your looking for or a friend. My second reason why I think this is because naybe you never met that family member and you want to get to know them. My last reason why I think this is because @CAPS1's really a person that you really love and need in your personal like. These are the reasons why I think that they are not spending to much times on the computers. (@NUM2) @CAPS3 reason why I think that people are not spending too much time on computers is because @CAPS1 can help you in many things that you need help on. My second reason why I think that they are not spending too much time on computers is because you can do your homeworks their and @CAPS1 can help you with @CAPS1. @MONTH1 last reason is because if you find something really difficult that you dont know @CAPS1 helps. (@NUM3) @CAPS4 I think that people are not spending too much time on the computers because you can do different kinds of activities their. My second reason why I think this is because when your having a @CAPS5 party and you need invitations the computer can help you. My last reason why I think this is because if you want to move to @CAPS3 state or country you can see the place on the website and then you can go. These are the reasons why I think that the computer is very helpfull. (@NUM4) I hope that after reading all the tipical reasons of computers like, @CAPS1 can help you on many things, you can look for people, and you can do different activities, that I really convinced you, also I hope that you really liked and enjoyed reading my letter.	3	4	7
890	1	I think that computers have positive effects on peole. People can find out important news online, and you can connect with people you don't see often. Also, you can order anything in the world online. These are three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers inform people about important news. If there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food. If there is a burglar going around, people can find out, and lock all doors and windows. And by knowing all this information, it helps helps people plan events, like birthday parites. Finding out important news is very helpful, and conveniant. And @PERCENT1 of people, are less to inconveniances, if they know the news. Another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with people they don't see often. This provides an easy way to share events tha have taken place, and just have some time to talk face to face. With video chat, you can show off new , or newborn baby. You can share you want with people you barely see. Experts say that freindships last longer if you talk to each ohter often. and with computers, this is possible. A third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online. If you need a japanese doing for someone in ohio, you can order it online. If you're are old, and can't go to the grocery store anymore, you can order then online. I have seen that people who can order everything online, don't have to do a lot of driving, and this saves time, money, and gas. This is also very convendent and is less stressful then waithing in lines to purchase on item. These are just three ways htat computers have had a positive effect on people. the are that you can find out important news, you connect with people you don't see ofte, and you can order anything in the world that's why I believe comptuers have a positive effect on people.	4	4	8
896	1	Dear local Newspaper, This is a letter about how I feel about the effects of computers. I think computers are great you can, interact with family and friends, learn about things going on around the world, and it could help you with school work. First I would like to say that you can interact with family and friends. You can just go on facebook, @CAPS1, or,myspace and talk, send pics, and comment on other peoples things. There are many groups you can join too, wich allows you to talk to other people and meet new friends. You can also interact with your family if they have a facebook or @CAPS1. The second reason why computers are not bad is because that there are many websites that you can find different information like science, math, history and all that kind of stuff. There are alot of different topics you can learn. You can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from. My last reasoning for thinking this way is that many kids do their homework on computers and if people are saying that computers are bad than the parents are not going to allow them to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects. There are many other reason why computers have a positive effects of people. But interacting with family and friends, learning about things around the world and your education depends on computers.	4	4	8
897	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The age of the computer is upon us. Every where you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree, I feel that the computer is a great @CAPS5 to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society."	4	5	9
898	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 ""isn't that great""!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt "	4	4	8
902	1	I think that computers help people in there everyday lives. They just make things so much easier. Computers help us to find information @CAPS2 we needed. Book hotels and airliners, they even allow us to interact with our friends. Yes it might take away times to do other things like exercising, but we can find out away to do both. Everyday I would go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basket ball. People just need to find a way to it out. Computers are good for if you need to find information about anything. All you need to do is type in what you want, and within seconds you have hundreds of different links for your desire. For example if you are in @CAPS1 school and you are deciding what college that you should go try the a great place that you can go to get information. People all over the world do that just about everyday. It is also a great place if you need information if you are doing a project in school and you need more info on your subject @CAPS2 I say it make things a lot easier there is no better example a reservation for a hotel or buying a plane ticket. Both of those things do on a computer because otherwise odds are you with of then. If we didn't have computers you would need to go to the hotel and get a room, and if there were no room you out of luck. On a computer it will say if they have any or not you would need to @CAPS3 tickets would have the exact same thing. Computer say @CAPS2 there are available flights to your destination and how much. So @CAPS2 you go to the airport you are not surprised. Another good reason why computer are good for people is that it helps your interact with your friends and family @CAPS2 you can't see them. There so many different ways you can do it to. On @CAPS4, @CAPS5, myspace. All the websites like that help you stay in touch with all of your friends. Even now they have somethings where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer. So if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon you can talk to them then. I even do that with my brother, he is in college and I dont see him that much so I just start chatting with him on the computer. Now those are some reasons on why I feel that computers are a great part of our lives. Thing like finding information and booking hotels, airplanes, ect. All help make our lives a lot easier at times. And talking with other people just makes us happy. Now I hope you see why computers are a good part of all of our lives.	5	5	10
917	1	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects computers have on people are good. I believe this because people can learn hand-eye coordination, they give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk with people from around the world. Firstly, effects computers have on people are good because the people can learn hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is good in many occations. Secondly, computers effects on people are good because computers give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people is important becuase people can learn about history and important figures in life. Lastly, the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world. This is usefull because the people can learn about each other, their customs and religious and also their cultures and heritage. All-in-all, I believe that computers have good effects on people because they can learn hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and computers even allow people to talk with people online from all parts of the world.	3	3	6
928	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people believe that the negatives of computers out weigh the positives. I believe that computers help as much more than hurt. There are a few minor instances where computers have hurt people, but @CAPS2 more instances where they have helped @CAPS2 people. There are some cases that a victim of an accident recovers with the help of computers. Likewise there are other times that close family or friends can talk to each other over the @CAPS3. Also, people could learn about amazing places. Thus computers are very vital to us. Computers are vital to us because they help our reflexes. In my experience as a computer engineer. I have learned that playing or using a computer call help victims of reflex damaging accidents. A computer helps the victim by giving them a better feel on their environment. The victem could see exactaly what he is doing and so could his and doctors. Like wise to the physical treatment, computers an relief. Thus the patient gets stronger physically and mentaly. Thus, computers help a humans life be enchacing their reflexes. Likewise to help our reflexes, computers with the @CAPS3 would help people that are distance apart could connect. One of the ways people very far away connect is with soldiers and their families. Back in my military days, nothing helped better than talking. The easiest way of this was talking over. It gave me a gigantic. Thus computers are vital to as humans. Likewise, computers help us see places that are amazing. For example, when a @NUM1 year-old boy visits a website that talks about the wonders of the @LOCATION1 rain forest. He then tells his science class, who the spread the word of preservation of the forest. The boy then grows up to be an explorer of the @LOCATION1, finding new speceses. All this would happen because he was on a computers. Computers help us see the unseen. In the end, computers are great if used in regulation. They help victims heal, soldiers connect and inspire the youth, Computers are vital source of knowledge and advancement for humans.	5	5	10
934	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and the society. My reasons are you can learn and find new information on anything, you are able to talk to people faraway and computers teach skills to use in the future. I will now like to elaborate my reasons further. First of all, going on the internet and search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want. On the internet you can even ask questions, and they will probably be answered. You my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show @PERCENT1 of people who do reports, find their facts on the internet. Google, yahoo, and other search sites have helped children become more intrested in learning. Also, using a computer ables you to talk to other people from faraway places or friends you have not seen in a while. You can even webcam with people. I remember a few weeks ago, my best friend moved to florida, and now we webchat everyday! Talking online will even lower your telephone bills. Chatting online doesn't lost anything, where as the telephone charges for out of country calls cost . Computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money. Last but not least, computers teach skills that can be applied later in life. Today many jobs in due using a computer, and technology is getting mom advanced. Before you know it will have to know how to work a computer. Also, you probably will need a computer in college. Proffesor @CAPS2 even stated, ""every single kid in my courses have some sort of computer."" In college you will take notes and do assignments. Using computers will help you do this and make your life easier. As you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly. My reasons are you can learn and find information on anything, you are able to talk to other people who are faraway, and computer skills will help you in life. Technology is advancing and were going to have to use a computer sooner or later."	4	4	8
935	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on @CAPS2.com. I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at @NUM1 pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around @NUM2. The following moring I wake up at @NUM3 am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am @PERCENT1 sure they are on facebook or @CAPS3 all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people @MONTH1 say ""that would never happen to me"" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sybling @MONTH1 need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer. "	4	5	9
942	1	"Dear local newspaper committee...., I am writing to you, about how there is a substancial dilemma within the concern of computer use. From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable ""@CAPS1,"" toward computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @MONTH1 ""help,"" one in obtaining the loss of their social enviorment. Computer @MONTH1 seem helpful but of @ORGANIZATION1 they are a great way to research for @ORGANIZATION1 reasons. But there is also the choice of books for research. Computer use has risen to a substancial crisis line, because they are addicting. An example is the well-known link called, ""@CAPS2,"" @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize. But when your child has a @CAPS2, and they are on the computer doing ""homework,"" there is a @PERCENT1 that they will end upon @CAPS2, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @ORGANIZATION1 purposed of you child. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2, and online games. Computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has increased their weight, due to videogames and computer? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. In the end, computers are a harzardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. But computers see it a different way. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them. This also revolves around addiction. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social enviornment. Computer @MONTH1 seem ""fun,"" but are defuliated when it comes to friends. In the end, I beleive that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social enviornment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons. Computers are not the way to go. So, try books."	5	4	9
953	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 the world having a network where people can connect, learn and work efficently. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help @CAPS3 connect with far-away places, develop hand-eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area. @CAPS2 being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world, unable to enjoy the beauty of @LOCATION3 or send help to the starving people in @LOCATION2. @PERCENT1 of money donated to @ORGANIZATION1 an organization that assists in global disasters comes from online. Without the computer how would our willing people help the rest of the world, or even know about the rest of the world? Give our community the ability to reach out to the farthest parts of the globe, give them computers. Computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else. Playing baseball simply doesn't require enough focus. The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand-eye coordination that could save lives. @PERSON1, who trains the @CAPS3 air force weighs in on the effects of computers. ""They have made a great deal of positive impact."" he states. ""@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots."" @CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well? The computers we own train @CAPS3 as we use them to have reflexes and hand-eye coordination equal to the best of the military. Computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster. Before computers @CAPS7 and calculating took @PERCENT2 more time but now they get our work done quickly and without error. @NUM1 year old author @PERSON2 states ""@CAPS4 computer helps me type @CAPS4 writing a lot faster and it is done right more importantly."" @CAPS7 and typing is just more efficent when you are using a computer accountants, students and even the journalists for your own newspaper need the computer to work faster and more efficently. Don't stunt our community's workers, give them what they need computers! Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. Our community benefits from the computers that help @CAPS3 connect with far away places, give @CAPS3 hand-eye coordination and help @CAPS3 work quickly and correctly. So explain in your next article that we need our computers. Computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them!"	6	6	12
983	1	The computer is a good way to contact family and friend. People send messages all over the world or just to fon. People like playing video games or be on websites that they like. People all over the world by laptops to travel to one place to another. Everybody don't be on computer because they think its not go to have but some people do like to have one to be sending messages to hang out with one another or be talking about how was your day. Many people want computer because they do have enough money to @CAPS2 one. Some computers cost a lot @MONEY1 money like, @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 and even more than @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 it depend witch one they get. Around the world many people sell their computers to get money to @CAPS2 different stuff like, shoes, clothes or games. They always sell stuff on ebay to get less or more money, instead they can't take the computer back to get your money or to get a new computer. People want the classic computers, but now they come out with new ones like, touch screen ones. Many people been buying them at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION1. Every seens the new computers came out people been buying a lot the company been making a lot @MONEY1 money from making the touch screen computers. Every new year the company make new computers so they can get thousands or @MONEY1. Company all over world make different computers to bring out new styles so people can like them and @CAPS2 them. New styles they make more money they make. Some people make their own companies to get money like the other companys get theirs, but some @MONEY1 the money you make some goes to the government. The money the give to the government is to take care @MONEY1 the homeless people. Computers are used from leaning or for fun. People share computers with other people they can't not share it because it wouldn't be fair. Some people take turne using it. Some people don't like taking turn with one another. Everybody share or have they own and they use it or not they can't force their server to it if somebody wants to net on it. Some people lie and say they were geting on it. People like joking around with others. Parents always say a computer is not a tag to play with computers cost a lot to repair and get it fixed all the people spill water on them a the computer mess up and the people be mad and maybe he/she just got a new computer. When computer first came out people bought them to see what they will be like. Many people liked them and it got all over the world and people were talking about them and the company made more and more until it got in stores all over the world. The computer got famase and the company made newer styles for everyone else. People bought a lot @MONEY1 computers everytime they come out with a new style. Many people had @NUM1, or @NUM2 at home as they @CAPS2 them. Companys made other company mad because the other companys were making better styles. People were ordering online to get new computers. And company how make them is making a lot @MONEY1 money. Company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the @CAPS1 one ever. When they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one. Some company joined to make one together.	4	4	8
1000	1	"The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one, and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced, not feared and avoided. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. Besides, for personal usage, computers are highly beneficial. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates, which really isn't reasonable, when analyzed closely. To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational, the computer is the future plain and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that, paint the picture of the future of our world. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate, pollutional margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our @CAPS1 slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever-growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumtances, such as an occurance in a workplace causing the area to be off-limits. As member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with simply the press of ""@CAPS2"", people across the world can be of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information, is so easy with a @CAPS3. Where would be without computers to find information rapidly? We would be still going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer. Even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows ""good"" websites to be viewed, and ""bad"" on potentially dangerous @CAPS4 to be binded. This eliminates all that is heard about on-line interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM2 websites, includes content considered ""detrimental"" to humans. Also, of those @NUM2, @NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminate, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable, and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear computers. We have come so far to create such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device, we must put it to use, and by doing so, better our own lives, and the life of @ORGANIZATION1."	6	6	12
1006	1	"I strolled into my bedroom, I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk. I thought that computers are very helpful. There are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. For instance, this year I had a sciences project about how my hobbies interests are related to science. One of my interests in reading, @CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results up. I had even gotten some pictures too. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I recieved it back. I had gotten a @NUM1 on this project! @CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to get on A on this. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 had moved away to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people. Both of us had been using this and we've been able to talk for on end. I don't see @PERSON1 as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help re-establish old relationships with friends and family. @CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you @CAPS3, and tests when you are ready to take them. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has been helping us practice for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades. The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers."	4	4	8
1015	1	Dear @CAPS1, I disagree with those who support advances in technology, the people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. Would you rather spend your time on the computer rotting like a vegetable or would you rather hang out with your firned, travel to other places that you never thought possive or even go to a gym and probably loose some pounds? I vote hanging out with my friends! You know people that like to travel to far away places and have fun would rather that than waste their time on a computer. As much as people like to look at all the cool places that they check out on the internet; what's the point in just sitting their and watching the screen when you could get a plane ticket and fly to the magical place that you saw on the computer. Ok. I know that traveling to faraway places can be scary because you never been to area in your life, but @CAPS3's worth the try. Ok fine if flying is not your thing then why not thy exercising. @MONTH1 be you have been trying to lose some extra pounds. You could always try that. Think about @CAPS3, my mother was using her so that she could fit into a size @NUM1 and now look she is in a size @NUM1. Why bore yourself to death with computers that will probably give you the wrong advise when you could always ask a friend for advise. Yes a friend a live and breathing human being, losing some weight will help you gain confidence if you just try. @CAPS3's just like @PERSON1, from @CAPS2 lower said, you got to want @CAPS3 if you want to accomplish that goal of yours. Everyone can go for that goal! Maybe you dont want to exercise, maybe you want to hang out with your friends and family. If you waste your time online chatting, how are you oing to chat with the people that are eight in front of you. If you can talk online then you can probably talk to people in real life? Right? Wrong! Some people can and some people cant. I am a very talk person, but I know how to talk on line if. I wanted to so why cant you? That's @CAPS3 the time has come t decide. Do you want to spend your time on or computer or do you want to spend your time in the real world. Get out your chair, turn off the computer get up. Put your wat on and walk outside and do something with yourself. Use you mouth not your hand. Talk to people comunicate with them @CAPS3 is not that hard. Trust me. If I can do @CAPS3 you can do @CAPS3 too! @CAPS3's now or never I choose now and so should you. Dont waste anymore time, go on a trip take a hangout. Just do @CAPS3. Dont run back to that computer. Throw @CAPS3 out you can live without @CAPS3.	5	5	10
1039	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now.	4	4	8
1043	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer in their home? Well who wouldnt! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, its quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like @CAPS3 and facebook you can talk to people you normally dont get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet you can use websites like google, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also if I had to research a topic for @CAPS1 history project then I would go onto the computer, to google and then type in @CAPS1 topic and be overwelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an at on the project thats how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick I can make @NUM4 powerpoints slides @CAPS6 with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make powerpoint slide: on overage @PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing @CAPS1 social studies project @TIME1 I had to find out what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library. I just hopped on google and clicked images and clicked images and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds @CAPS1 screen was @CAPS6 with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of facebook, myspace, @CAPS3, or twitter? Well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am @CAPS3 or facebook I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time one of @CAPS1 friend from camp lives in @CAPS10 so I dont get to see her alot so with the wonderful invention of facebook I could talk to her all the time. Just think without the computer facebook would have never been invented so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also when I go on the computer. I have the option signing onto something called @CAPS3 or email. With this I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That would happen if the computer wasnt invented. So dont you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well lets make it @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer.	4	5	9
1045	1	"What do you think about computers? I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have @NUM1. Please heed the following advice. Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. I teaches them life skills such as hand-eye coordination, a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states ""@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of inter-ation with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts."" Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grevious idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law ferm as presidental secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future. People say kids are the future, not if theyre not succesfull. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn & communicate with @NUM1 another & others. We all want our kids to be happy. @NUM4 out @NUM5 kids use the internet to research things for @CAPS2 & projects. Kid therapist @PERSON2 says ""kid who chat, with other kids though internet like facebook, @CAPS3, & myspace are normaly more socialy interactive with other kids. I know you thinking there a lot of ""@CAPS4"" thing on the internet dont want my kids to see, conversly you can set limits & child block. & you also dont want you kids at risk of obesity because of lack of excercise. So give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer @NUM6 hours a day. They do @CAPS2 & whatever time they have left they chat with friends. Its not all @CAPS4. As you can see computers can be seen in a very possotive manner. Heed my advice & allow your kids the freedom of internet. They will be happier, trust me."	5	4	9
1054	1	I think computers are very benefical. There are so many uses! From learning, to games, to videos, and to a tool that is very useful. Without computers we would be like the @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 offense any @CAPS1 people). We would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to see becalling news. Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are lots of things to do. You can play online games, off-line games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. Without the internet I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I now am a member of the online community called www.MOCpages.com I post my creations, look at others creations, and comment, and chat. I use the internet to reasearch for school projects. Right now, I am reasearching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Normally I would have to slave over books to find something. Now it is much easier, because keywords are matched. Finally, it is a good fool. Did you know the millitary needs computers to store info, attack, keep record, and to pilot certain planes? I need to use a computer to type up home work, because as you can see, my hand writing isn'@CAPS4 the neatest. Also, I stay in touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I persuaded you on my position. Remember computers, do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a fantastic tool. Thanks for reading, bye!	4	4	8
1081	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change.	4	3	7
1087	1	"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. From searching pictures and information for a school projects, watching videos of songs, friends, or tv shows that you love or wonna check up on. to looking at websites. Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously! ""Have you change your mind? have you listened closely?"" @CAPS3 so your life just become a whole lot easier, by using facebook, for social ability, @ORGANIZATION1 and windows programs for school, and google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer!"	6	5	11
1088	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button. That is as simple as just going out and purchasing a computer. Computers are becoming more and more popular. Some people think that people use computers too much. I am here to say that, that is a terrible accusation. First, computers help you with school work. Let's say you have an essay and it needs to be @NUM1 words or more you can just use word cant, then you have the exact amount of words. Also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic. You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from. If you had a homework assignment that you didn't understand you could look up how to do it on the internet. But this i just the begining. Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture. You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from @LOCATION1. You would also be learning about their culture. This could also be a way to learn another language. If the person spoke fluently in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 than he or she could teach you. You might be able to see how an @CAPS2 household runs. You could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life. Finally, you can understand the world around you. There are many websites where you can get a live sattelite feed on places on every corner of the globe. You could also do reasearch on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it. You might also learn about nature. You could understand more about plants and animals. You can also got a look into space. You can learn about planets, if there is life on planets or water or anything else these would be things you can reasearch. So to sum it all up, you can get school work done. You can interact with people all over the world. You can also learn about the world around you and that covers less than a fraction of everything you can do on the computers, but don't stay on all day. Make sure you go outside and have a great time too!	4	4	8
1089	1	Dear @CAPS1, I have same questions for you and I was hoping you could answer them. I was wandering. Do you have any computers in your house, if so how many? Also, do you like using the computer? I am trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because. I want to ask them how do they survive without one!? Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer. You can talk, email, even see people through a computer because now adays everyone has a videcam hooked onto their computer. I want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time your going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen-name to text someone or just go on verizon, at&t, sprine... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restraunt/place on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on histicoral, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers help us everyday. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything. Most of someones life can be saved to the computer. If you have bad handwriting, then you could just type up your paper and hand it in all nice and neat. Like I said before computers are esstential to our present day lives @CAPS3 reading this, I bet you'll agree.	4	4	8
1097	1	Dear fellow citizens, @CAPS1 think if you had to get a book for every question you had. That would take a long time to even get the book let alone read it. Computers have helped the modern world with questions, long distance friends, and entertainment. Computers have helped us with more then those things the @CAPS2 is sucha universal thing that its hard to come up with all of the helpful things it does. For one the @CAPS2 helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them. Sites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 allow us to communicate and/or play with them. @CAPS1 think is the only way to talk with a friend from a different place would be to pick up the phone and call them well your friendship would disappear very quickly. This would happen because no one ever usualy has the time to pick up the phone and talk to the person and do nothing else. Well when you talk to them on the @CAPS2 you can do other things. For example if I wanted to I could talk to someone and the @CAPS2 and clean my room. Further more computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or any else that is entertaining. On the to do I when my brother would let me use the play again. I was but them I @CAPS1 went better A also play movies, @CAPS5 shows videos. If you ever miss a show to watched home of the show and watch it. This could save someone time and effort. Lastly, The computers much more efficient is looking yet things. IT is much faster then looking through the library and you don't have leave your I although people say that the @CAPS2 is taking away time from reading well it really isn't it. For everything you want you can read online or if you really want to you can have the @CAPS2 don't for you. Reading isn't a problem at all. @NUM1 of america believes that computers help greatly and how they have more time to do things is being upgraded every day and it keeps getting better and better. In conclusion I believe that computers are helping us and is not a bad thing. Computers are great for us and good for bussy people. Now go and get a @CAPS2 to.	5	5	10
1099	1	Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people. People tend to get moody. and it seems that computers are addictive. I think computers have a huge effect on people. The nubmer one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit inside for most of the day. Also they get so lazy they don't want to get up so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their hause. The next idea is that they do not get enought exersise, because they isn't sit there all day and don't move. But when they do move its to get something to eat or go get their phone. This is why they should limit kids and adults to only @NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day. @CAPS1 next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get . Like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad. They get all couped up inside for the whole day. They don't see enough because people don't see they . If they hour each day the moody ness would change. People need lot of exersise to maintain weight and muscle. @CAPS1 last receson the computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer . Like if they are playing a game all day and don't realize it they will get addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport. In conclusion what I am trying to tell you taht it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer, because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a hgih risk of obesity. So can you please listen to @CAPS1 ideas.	4	4	8
1101	1	Dear, @CAPS1 I am writting this article on computers to inferm you my oppinun on computers positive and negotive efects. The reason why computers are so succsesful is beacuse of some of the great imformation they. Such as directions to a place until you are going to or home imformation on a subject or a pearson. Althoug these all sound good any one can post imformation on the internet so some imformation misnt not all be accrate. Some reasons why the computer is bud is beacuse of signs wich are not safe and can give your pearsonal imformation to a and comeing back to bud you in the future. Also webite or pop up icon are not suttebul for younger kids and exposeing them to to mature for them. Lastly talking on the computer is apart of our everyday lives such as emails almost every american whita computer here. A email, this is a great to relie or. Also the new sorse of web witch giving you the ability to see peaple and into the computers wich is raipidly growing in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 all in this article this you my point of veiw on computers.	4	4	8
1103	1	I believe that the house hold computer can help with every day things like research and developemint, home work, art work, an always renewing travel dictionary, a @NUM1 hour super store filled with never ending items, video games and a very sofistacated colculator. New programs are comeing out all the time but idiction is always seen as a very bad thing to have to do any part of you will start to have no friends or girlfrends and you'll probleay start to egnore your family and you'll get corple tunnle sindram from typeing and focreamea from staring at a brite screen alday and looking at it closely. You will probley get a bad back from siting alday in a chair or neeling or leaning back in a chasse lounge and it @MONTH1 be comfey but it's bad for you, in concloshion computers help a lot and they are fun. But it addicting to so have fun. But don't get addicted because computers @MONTH1 be fun but portions are helthy and thats what should be done.	3	3	6
1105	1	"Dear editor, @TIME1 week, I noticed an article in the paper headlined ""@CAPS1 off the computer and go exercise."" This caught me off gaurd because there are many benefits to computers, such as it enchances education, you can learn about foreign countries, and you can talk to other people. Every school has a computer. Their easy access and very helpful. I know that @TIME1 year, if someone asked a question and the teacher wasn't sure of it, we would go strait to the computer. It also helps us do better on projects. I know I had to do a project @TIME1, and without the computer I wouldn't have it today. We also use the computers for the programs they have. In art, we made a cartoon, and made it look real with photoshop. It's also easy and fast to use a computer for research. You can also learn ahead far away places with a computer. For example, you can find out about other countries in the world. You could find out if it were landlocked, not landlocked, how many people live there, and facts similar to those. You can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government. Finally, you can also learn up-to-the minute-facts with websites like @CAPS2.com. Lastly, you can talk with other people using email, instant messaging, and websites like facebook, which allows you to connect with friends. With email, you talk with someone for buisness for to recieves links to @CAPS1 to websites, and to @CAPS1 information. Instant messaging is just like texting on your phone, except much faster. You can instantly talk to people and catch up with them. Thousands of people are on facebook. You can connect with old friends, and talk to current ones. I knkow my mom uses facebook and talks to old friends since she moved. So, in my opinion, I think computers are a good thing to have. Not only do they enhance your education, but they also teach us foreighn countries history and let us connect to old friends. When you were in school, do you remember your ""best-friend-for-life?"" @CAPS3, with facebook you can catch up with them, instead of them being a memory."	5	4	9
1113	1	"Click, click, click the mouse of a computer goes as you are searhcing throughout the internet. Computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, I believe that computers have a very positivr effect on people. Computers can touch kids to be social because first off computers are like an online phone, you can talk to people in so many ways, facebook caht, aim(chat),, myspace, twitter, skype, and a lot of others ways that i havent mentioned. Also I think is a teen or kid or even adult that is too nervous to talk to people on the phone or in person, and is socialy not their or painfully shy can start of by just chatting with people online. Once they feels more comfoatable, then they can start talking to the person on the phone or in person. For example, I once @MONTH1 this girl who was very sweet, but was painfully shy and everyone for it, so one day she decided to make an aim nad talk to poeple on it, and provove that she isn'e a annoying wherd girl that everyone makes her out to be. She turned out to be one of the nicestly funniest person I ahve hung out with in a while. Which how internet can help you. HAve you ever felt that computers sometimes make you more intellegent? Well, in my opinion I think that computers help out so much more than a book. If you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button. Ahving a computer is like your own personal handbook of veerything in the world. A lot of people these days study from the internet, I know I sure do. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 more people say, that computers are more helpful than books and can make you a lot more intellegent, because the internet has so much more deatil than books, and mor efacts. @PERCENT2 of kids that have a computer use it for homewrok. Computers is a great tool to use while you are doing your homework. I spend most of the day on my computer doing homework than off it. For example, say you have a report and you need facts on @CAPS1 @PERSON1, and where he was born. You would jus type in, ""when was @ORGANIZATION1 boen."" and born! There it is with the date exactly. Also if you having a piece of writing like your rough draft so why spend the time trying to write really neat and perfect? When you can just open up a word document and type it up. To sum everything up computers have deffenatly a positive effect on people from these three reasons, computers are a great way to teach kids hohw to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, But I understand where your coming from people are spending way to much time on their computer and less time exersising, but you can look up great ways to exersise on the internet and watch videos of people that have @CAPS2.V shows about exersising and do it with them on the computer. Remember, computers aren'@CAPS2 just a waste of time and way to will your brain cells. they have a very positive effect on you. "	5	5	10
1116	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reason why I am against usage of computers. My @NUM1 reason why I am against usage of computers is, the negativity, like for example too many pop ups come on the website your own and then they mini little advertisments like ""@CAPS1 on me"" ""free trial"". And thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My seocnd reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called ""@CAPS2"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier thats not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is montoring, alot of parents dont watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inapproiate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fought beacuse they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dont always know what your clicking on and you can @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. So just have my opinions and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks."	4	4	8
1120	1	Dear editor, I have heerd about me advance in technology dispute. I would like to say their I think it does benef it our society. I think this because: You can communicate with friends, they help you with school and a reliable resource for you need to find. Please read on so I can explain my reasons. Computers and technology benefit us in many ways. One of mom's they able you to talk to friends. Computers give you an easy and fast way to communicate with others. Instead of sending a boring letter that takes forever to get there, you can hook up with your friends, you haven't seen in a while. I remember when my friend moved to @LOCATION1. It would of taken me forever to there, so instead I went online and talked to him. Also, lastly, it less your hand. Now please read on for my second reason. My second reason . Computer are a of looking in many different take days. You can go online and find everyone, in ten minutes. In fifth grade I had to do this really hard project. I looked in books @NUM1 days and find. But then looked up everything I needed to known in an half hour. Lastly, they have more success. If you go on in @ORGANIZATION2 you could find hundreds of on one topic. Easy right? New read on for reason. My last and strongest reason that technology can help you find anything in everyday life. Computers can help you find your way. They supermarket for you. They can help with anything. One year I went on vacation to @LOCATION2. my mom move. So got lost help. Na, if we gotten difference have nevir pickel. Wouldn't you be more confident if you had ? Computers can a lso find for places for you an your friends or family to have fun like it couldn't find places never heard of. Such as @ORGANIZATION1. Now need on so can all up. So, as you can see technology, benefits our society in a big way. Mostly in these three reasons: You can communicate with your friends, they help you in school, and they are a reliable source for everybody life. i hope you have enjoyed rading this. Please take this info your next . thank you for your time, and thank you for reading my paper.	4	4	8
1126	1	@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online.	5	5	10
1133	1	Dear @CAPS1 news editors, @CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the technological item to have over the past @NUM1 or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! However some experts believe that people spend to much time on computers, and that people are not as active or healthy because of it, and. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are employed as of @DATE1, and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs, or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work (or school) much more work can be done, with programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 people can type reports, and with programs like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2, and iCalculator, workers can calculate taxes faster, so they have more time to work. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! You can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell, without raising you phone bill from calling the brokers. Laptops make work possible on the go to! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs, and other skills you @MONTH1 need times in life. You can learn typing, work programs, and programing which are all needed in some lines of work. Computers increase math skills and hand eye coordination to! And you can read your favorite books via online scans!, now you @MONTH1 be wondering why not pick up a real book? Well, you can’t online scans, and some are free! Not only do computers teach skills and work, they are very fun too! Between @CAPS6, twitter, email, googleBUZZ, mySpace, ooVoo, skype and gamesradar, there are lots of ways to talk to friends and meet new people. On @CAPS6 I can have up to @NUM2 people talk to whenever I want! Why not talk to real people? you ask, well the answer is simple, maybe it is a lazy @DATE2 and nobody wants to go out anywhere, or maybe your friends want to talk right before bed time. Talking to real people is important, but can’t be done all the time! Online gaming has become an sensation!, and not only an @NUM3, @NUM4 and @CAPS8, @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 can “game” too! So many people are gaming now, that if your not, you are missing out on an amazing experience. Some people think gaming is a waste of time, but the same can be said for any indoor leisure activity, everybody needs a fun activity they can do anytime! Besides everybody likes having fun! Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making @LOCATION1 into fat, lifeless losers, but, it is opposite, you can socialize online and meet new people. People (like myself) can balance computers and games, with exercize and sports. With computers you can efficently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are posotive if used correctly. I hope you like this artice, thanks for reading.	6	6	12
1153	1	"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!"	5	4	9
1170	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS1 has come to @CAPS2 attention that certain members of our society believe that computers are not beneficial. This position comes from lack judgement and a closed mind. Computers are lifelines to buisness workers who use them to complete all of their work, these tools also enable news of disaster or weather to spread efficiently and effectively. These technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends. In todays society computers are vital and getting rid of them would be like stopping oxygen from making its way to the body, being accompanied by multiple severe consequences. First and foremost, about @PERCENT1 of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers. These works of art aren't just handy-dandy toys , rather @CAPS5 essential to the working class @CAPS5 a # @NUM1 pencil to a student taking a cut. @PERSON3, an owner of a small buisness, agrees. ""@CAPS2 company designs software and uses computers @NUM2. Many of @CAPS2 employees work from home and have to own computers."" The growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon, rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others. By ripping our computers from lives of workers chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences. Adults aren't the only ones whose jobs consists of computers. Nowadays students' homework is mostly online, computers decrease the amout of time needed to write an essay and are glare to students of all ages, @PERSON4, an eighth grades at @ORGANIZATION1, is an example of this dilema. Every night she has at least three hours of homework and usually one hour be @CAPS1 requires a computer, however, this isn't a problem because @CAPS1 cuts back the time @CAPS1 takes for @PERSON4 to do her homework. She can quickly type up an @CAPS3 essay or research a science topic instead of doing @CAPS1 painstakingly slow using an old fashion method. Moreover, computers are doors into the real world, especially for residents of @LOCATION1. Whether some people like to believe @CAPS1 or not, @LOCATION1 is a bit of a sicludded area where people aren't aware of what is going on outside of their closed off town. Computers cause news to spread like electricity and open @LOCATION1 residents eyes to national and global problems @PERSON2, another student at @ORGANIZATION5, states, "" @CAPS4 the earthquake took place in @LOCATION3 @CAPS2 friends and I were all at lunch, @CAPS5 we came back to class @CAPS2 teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the white board"" @CAPS6 computers were taken away a stream of knowledge would be cut off from adults and children. Most importantly, computers create communication between friends and family calling up to talk to someone isn't always an option, so computers are the better choice. Families can connect with each other no matter @CAPS6 they have cell phone reception or what area of the world they are in, @PERSON1 is a senior at @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION1 who agrees. ""@CAPS4 I go to college next year I am going all the way to @LOCATION2 and want to be able to talk to @CAPS2 family, via email and instant message I can contact them even @CAPS6 its inconvenient because they don't have to respond right away."" @PERSON1 brings up a good point computers serve the luxury of communication, which is vital to keep @PERCENT2 of healthy relationships, @CAPS5 shows a study at @ORGANIZATION4. In conclusion, computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away. The are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world. Computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate. Therefore, I urge you, readers of the @ORGANIZATION2, to raise your voice about the benefits of computers, so they aren't taken away from our society."	6	6	12
1171	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1? Are you there?"" ""@CAPS2 you hear me?"" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necesity to an average person. Computers help everyone, and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but @CAPS2 they always prove trustworthy? Computers are alwasy reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others...that are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you @CAPS2 choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personaly preffered option is @ORGANIZATION2 email. I myself have family in @LOCATION1, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be through the roof! How else am I supposed to keep intact with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families in @LOCATION2 say they have relatives that are far away. That is @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their famly. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you @CAPS2 interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student of @PERSON1, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far away colleges or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could visit a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are killed for them. Computers are the easy, environment friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that @MONTH1 be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible @CAPS3. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. ""@CAPS3 are only powerful if you let them be, and let them take control,"" says @CAPS4, an expert on the subject. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today, and tomorrow, know what is out there, and how to stop the minor @CAPS3. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn now things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. What are safe even if some don't agree. It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes computers! I see why you might think no, they should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and t.v. will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers, and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to!"""	6	6	12
1182	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe computers and excelling technology benefits society because it can help with hand eye coordination, it will be an easy way to learn about faraway places and cultures, and your able to save and use your time more wisely. First of all every person needs hand-eye coordination, if you didn't you would either thore a ball in the comlplete other direction or you'll get hit in the face with it. Computers benefit childrens education too, they can help you discover and learn about far away places. For example if a student is studying @PERSON3 @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class or maybe @PERSON2 in music class, instead of pulling out the old, dustty biography book it would be easier to look them up on a search engine. Lastly the computer benefits everyday working or stay at home parents because if you have to get in contact with a cetain person or business quickly you don't have to take the chance of having to go look in the phone book and the person or business isn't in it, just go to to @NUM1.com type in a last name or business name, so your all set. Also if your child is being a nuisance screaming and running around the house you can just set them up with an educational game so you can get your house-hold chores finished. Those are three of the most important reasons why I think computers benefit society. They are hand-eye coordination, learning techniques and saving everyday people time.	4	3	7
1192	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. First reason is they give the ability to learn about people and places in the world. Another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world. Last reason is it can help you be organize and get a job. Now I will move on to give more details on my first reason. When I have a school project on a famous person or somewhere in the world I know that the computer will give me more information than a book. If I am doing the project on a place and I want to know how far is it from where I live to there or whats the weather of that place all I have to do is type it down in a search engine and the computer will give me a bunch of websites that will answer my question. Now, if you can't draw a picture for your biography project go on a search engine and type down the name of the person you're doing and don't for get to type down pictures or photos and you will see a bunch of pictures of that person. Now I will move on to my second reason. Computers bring unity in the nation and the world for example think about these social networks like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 these networks has millions of people on them that you can talk to. And what about the @ORGANIZATION1, webcam, where you can talk to the person face to face. Just recently there been earthquakes in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3 you can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need. Now I will move on the my last reason. Computers are everywhere there's never a job that does not have a computer. That means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be.	4	4	8
1217	1	I think having computers are good because you can use it to find places. Another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer. You can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework. That is why computers are good and we need them. First reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us. Also we could look at places we never saw before and if you want to get some where you can go the computer to do that.	2	2	4
1224	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 a world without computers. Where would we get all of our information from? Would we have to religh on television or magaziens, where information can be changed? Or how would we ever get any reports done for work or home work? I know many people who don't write neat, how will any one read it? Basically, computers effect our lives so much in a good way that it would be chaos with out them. Computers allow people to learn how to type which can improve all around skills such as hand eye coordination, they let us connect with places we are not familiar with and see family members, and they allow people to have an online education which can help with the economy. Computers effect us in a very good way and they change our every day lives, @CAPS2 children these days cannot type. A recent study done at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT1 of kids older than @NUM1 already know how to type on a keyboard. Computers have such a big effect on us with so many skills that people don't ignoledge enough. Because all of thoes kids know how to type, they can spell better too. I remember one time when I was in the middle of writing a report online. I got @NUM2 a word I didn't know and had always had trubble spelling it. So I took my time and typed it out one letter at a time, and it was correct! This example shows that computers can effect everyones lifes, even younger kids. The way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move. For example, when babies learn how to walk the religh on their brains show them how it's done. This is just like how when there is a natural disaster, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 we religh on our computers to show us and tell us what is going on and how something like this could happen. Computers can effect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them. Computers effect families everyday lives by giving them online educations. My @NUM3 year old cusin told me that she was happy her mom could go back to college from home because then they could spend time together. I know you might think that computers can make families get further apart but they actually bring them closer together. There is only one choice and that is that computers effect all of us in a good way. They can help us learn how to type, connect us with our world and bring families closer together. Without computers we wouldn't be the same as we are today.	4	5	9
1227	1	On today's society many new technologys have been released. Such as the @NUM1 player, cell phone, video game counsels such as xbox @NUM2 but probably the most popular and most used is the computer. The ability. and search information in just a couple of clicks. Some people are with technology that they almost get addicted to it and use it every chance they get. Is this good for people is what there doing affecting there health and physical activity. Yes, people these days are affect by the internet greatly. Such websites in once the addiction highly such as facebook, myspace, and youtube. These are probably the is for school. In the @NUM3 years sence facebook. the level increased dramatically and so have the high pressure level! Dr. @DR1 says. This online behavior must stop people are getting addicted and gaining wait from the lock of physical activity. As you can see the online internet can be very use but not something that should be used non stop it can affect you helth and bring other dangers.	4	4	8
1233	1	Dear local Newspaper, I hear you are whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. In my opinion, i think that, yes, they do have a positive effect on people. I think this because @NUM1. Computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. Computers are often helpful to those with special needs, and @NUM3. The computer allows you to connect win people who @MONTH1 live faraway with out having to travel to them. I really enjoy learning about foreign places and culture. I know that from my own experience that the more knoledgable you are about foreign places and culture. The more smart you become overall. Without the computer, many people would not be able to explore these places and learn about them. The computer is basically a big encyclopedia that supplys important information to those who are unable to travel across the world and visit these places. Without computers, people would be less educated about the people, cultures, and the world we live in . Places such as pyrimids in in @LOCATION1, and . Don't you agree? In my school there are several students with special needs. I, personally, can't even begin to imagine how difficult it must be for them to learn. But one thing i do know is that the computer is a very helpful rescource to them. The computer supplies pictures, sounds, and interactive activities that really help kids out. Since some of the kids in my school who have special needs have a hard time reading. The computer helps by reading it aloud to mom. Where would those children be if they didn't have computers? I love keeping in touch with my distent family and friends. Don't you? It used to be that it would take days and days to send and recieve a letter from relative. @MONTH1 because of the computer, hard task can be done with a simple click of the mouse. But thats not all. Besides sending virtual e-mail to people, because of the computer, you see them face to face! Some computers have webcams that allow you to see someone through the screen of your computer, isnt that great?! So, why waste money flying to see someone to deliver a simple message when you can deliver it personally in almost less than @NUM4 seconds? Becaose of the computer, people talk more and are often brought closer together. So, as you can see there are many important positive effects that computers have on people. The reasons being @NUM1. computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. computers are often helpful to those with special needs. And @NUM3. computers allow you to connect with people who @MONTH1 live faraway without having to travel to them. Thank you for listening.	5	4	9
1236	1	In my own opinion, computers are great addition to our world. Computers can help people with schoolwork, communication and entertain you in a safe way. Those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world. First of all, computers help with a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world-wide-web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can't find in books. In addition if a student forgets, losses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be @CAPS1 neat @CAPS1 possible. That is hard for some students,  typing it is neat, and everyone can do it. @CAPS1 you can see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are a great way to communicate and keep-in-touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send some thing to him, he could easily e-mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, the could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up an conference, the teacher could e-mail the parent a time and date. That is why computers are great can easy communication. Lastley, computers provide a safe, fun way or entertainment. Many companies make kid-friendly websites that  go on. For instance, my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kindergardeners who go on these websites, do better in first grade compared to those who don't computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide east communication, and provide safe educational activities, @CAPS1 you can see, computers are a great addition to our world.	5	5	10
1239	1	"Dear editor of @LOCATION2 @CAPS1, @LOCATION3's society is being ruined, ruined by computers of course. They are so time consuming that I am afraid they are causing more people to be obease in @LOCATION3. People are afraid that they are limiting themselves from interacting @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, and spending time enjoying nature. I feel the exact same way and someone should put a stop to this! An average american goes on a computer for about @NUM1 hours a day. With going to work or school, and sleeping, that way leaves a litle @NUM2 to go out and explore nature. Our national parks @NUM3's have been decreasing in their numbers of customers at a fast rate. I visited yellow stone last week to find out if as many people have been goind. The man who works at the entrance was saying that ""since the start of @DATE1 alone about @PERCENT1 less people have been to @LOCATION1,"" I believe that the reason for that is because of computers. They limit people from goind to parks or to zoo's, by consuming the public time with all of the ""new fashion"" or the newest game on miniclip.com. Also, I believe that the public is spending so much time on computers that they are not able to go out and exersize. With the newest ""sims game,"" how are kick supposed to stay fit and healthy? I did a study on how many hour kids spend on thier computer and out of the people who said more than @NUM4 minutes. @PERCENT2 of them could legally considered obease. Is that now we want our next gerneration to be out next president and lawyers, and doctors? @CAPS8, we want them to live life to the @CAPS4 by taking care of themselves by exersizing. Computers are getting kids so consumed that is not ok. Lastly, with computers, families and friends don't really talk to each another @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, or interact with each other at all i mean sure, parents come home to thier child on the computer and give them a kiss on the head. But is that enough? I do not believe it is. I asked a friend of mine's child about how much he interacts with his family and friends? @CAPS2 to @CAPS2 he said that well since he got his new ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 with a @NUM5 gig hardrive"", he hadn't been talking to them a whole @CAPS2 to @CAPS2. However, everyday we went on ""chat"" ""for a good @NUM6 hours"", to talk to his friends. And only occasionally would he get an @CAPS7-mail or two from his asking how his days was. I do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life. That is what @LOCATION3 has come down to computers. They limit you from interacting to friends and family, give you less time to exersize and limit you from going out and exploring nature. Who knows, maybe at this time in @NUM7 years, @LOCATION3 will be run by computer. Do we want that, @CAPS8! so lets put a stop to it now. Thank you very much!"	6	5	11
1254	1	I do not agree that computers benefits society. There are threes big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and arent spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people arent getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day. People would gain weight might ever get dabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten tov used to all the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk, with friends. People should al least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. So this is why I think this is bad for the societys benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart. Thank you!	4	4	8
1262	1	Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure.	4	4	8
1267	1	In my opinion i think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow you to communicate will people from anywhere in the world. You can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book. Also many more jobs want people with computer skills. It is also fun and educational. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, lets say @LOCATION1. It would be a lot harder, dont you think? Well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer. Many teachers enjoy doing activities with penpals. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. Also, if you were looking for specific information about florida it is alot easier on a computer. You just type in what it is you are looking for, rather than reading through tons of books, in which case you might not even find what you are looking for. Also the computer has millions of iinformation. The computer also has various pictures which is also good. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper. For example make animated movies and video games. These things have evolved over the years thanks to computers. Finally my last reason, its not only educational its also fun. Sure you can research information and do you rhomework on the computer, but you can also play games. Computers can do all sorts of different things. Computers can be programed to have simulations for jobs like policemen ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers our country probably wouldn't be as evolved as it is today.	4	4	8
1270	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a coolest effect on people. It allows people to develop hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about faraway people and cultures, and communicate online through e-mail or instant messaging. All of these reasons prove to be a positive reason to use the computer. You will need computer skills in various jobs and what better to start than now. Hand-eye coordination is a and in life. You need the in jobs, and in to days @CAPS1 the for that gets In the quarter mile must be able to find his and on in an office you have to watch as typing. you to watch popular with today. @CAPS6, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are only a few of many websites were people can communicate through instant messaging or e-mail. All of these sites allow you to find family members, friends, and many more. You can in with a friend that is out of state, or you can talk with a person out of this country! Many people do this in their spare time to try and set up a reunion with people that you know in middle school through college. Tons of these people have not seen were @NUM1. So as you can see contacting people through internet is by many people in our world today. So as you can see I support the use of computers, and I feel they are critical to peoples daily lives. Whether they are building hand-eye coordination, researching a country, or contacting family and friends through @CAPS3, @CAPS2, @CAPS6 the internet is highly valued and I hope you feel the same way.	4	6	10
1271	1	The computer is a great achivement of man. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other capabilities. Even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world. It has negatively afect to people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Along with that they are being socialy active. The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people. It would be great if some how the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should wont to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just dont let computers control your life.	4	4	8
1274	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, some people do spend most of the day on the computers, but not everyone. Oh, let me start with no. Not all people take atvantege of the computer. Like scientest, your banks, and schools. These tipe of computers helps us through life. With out these computers then we willl still be cluless on a lot of things. But, there are people out there that did take atvantege of the computers. And they still do. With unforgiving acks like child porn. One of our mane problem in the world is child porn. And a lot has to do with the kidnapping. Or in rare cases the parents are the cause of it. So these are a lot of changes that need to be doen. But when there cleared then the computer world will be peacful once agaen.	3	3	6
1281	1	"Do Computers benfit the society? Yes, computers benefit the society. Computers give kids so much knowledge about things they would not be able to do or go in real life. Another thing is computers give kids a positive ego or entertainment. Also computers let other kids interact with each other like facebook, or @CAPS1. There are many good details why computers are good for the society. First, when most kids dont know an answer to question they can go on google to fing the answer. Which helps in most cases. Also when on google, or any ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" it gives kids the chance to @CAPS2 anything and most likly get arreasonable answer. Kids can @CAPS2 up facts about other countries, famous people, and even types of pets! Another benefit of having computers is most kids on the internet go to have fun or entertain themselves, which could lead to a positive ego or better self-convidence. Just because kids arent going outside to have fun, doesnt mean they cant have fun inside either. Third, parents or any gauriden always talk about there kids or would like to see them with friends. Well having thing such as facebook and @CAPS1 or @CAPS5 you can make new friend around the town or even other @CAPS6. The internet can do all of those things. Finally do computers benefits society? Yes computers do benefits society, they can give you alot of knowledge, make new friends and to just let kids be kids. As you can see computers do benefit the society."	4	4	8
1307	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 posission on the computer contraversy issue is that computers are good and so vital in todays everyday world. Computers are a good way to communicat, they are most people main source of info and buisnesses use computers for various importanat task as well. Computers are a great way to comunicate. You can @CAPS2 with your friends, email your peers and now there are website you can go on where you can talk to your friends or a stranger. Being human I do sometimes forget @CAPS1 homework or school asignments. In that situation I would just go on @CAPS1 computer and @CAPS2 a friend asking them for the assignment. Its quick easy and it works. There are also websites where you can talk and connect with other people who share the same interests as you. Its a good way to make an online friends. The computer goes beyond just allowing you to talk enables you to connect with people no matter where you are. Do you ever have a question that you instantly want or the to? Just go to ""google"" or ""@CAPS4"", tpye in your question and recieve an immediatly. AHve a reaserch paper due on @PERSON1? You can do all of your reaserch online. There are thousands of website loaded with information can anything and evrything. Youc an enter yout topic a search engine and find hundreds of sources that way. You can easily fine information any subject you want, or find the name of that song you just heard on the using your computer. COmputer are used in buisness environment too. Computers are used for getting messages to different people in the. They are also used to create and presernt presentations marketing campains and now product ideas, also many companies use the internet as a source of advertiring and need the bublicity to sell their. So the computer is necessary for to function as well. So in conclusion computers are not over used, they are just used for so many things that at some point every one will nead one. They are a good way to communicate, an important and main source of info and they are also used in buisness environments too."	4	5	9
1311	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 people are skeptic on whether or not computers benefit people. I strongly believe that computers do indeed benefit humanity for it allows people to talk online with loved ones and friends across the globe, and learn about those foreign places. Computers don't take away from lifes, but shows it through fascinating synthetics. Computers allow people of all ages to interact with others over the world-wide web. Sometimes it's better to meet with people in person, but that isn't always the case. What @CAPS5 you have relatives or friends in a different country? The internet is the best way to contact those people. Also, what @CAPS5 you are in a band or a group, and need to contact them while you are out of town? Social sites like facebook or myspace allow the group members to talk and discuss matters at the hotel or wherever he @MONTH1 be. In addition to both of these reasons, students can obtain missing work and email the teacher from his household. This allows the pupil to obtain his lesson and catch up on anything he or she has missed. The technological breakthrough of the @DATE1 known as computers allow interaction with other people as well as learn of distant lands. @CAPS4 people including myself, want some culture in their lives, and wander about this lively planet we call earth and find out whats out there, but can not acheive said goal. The computer saves us time and money to do these things. All we have to do is open a search bar, type in a word, and boom, we are looking at @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, or even the fields of @LOCATION1. Any place you want is at your. In addition to this, @CAPS5 a new tourist attraction comes to be, whether it is an amusant park, a monument, or a historical find, the internet can show us this. We can see things we would be seeing @CAPS5 we were present at the place, but instead on a monitor in your home. The computer allows you to do @CAPS4 things without actually encountering their happenings. In conclusion, computers are helpful for they allow us to preform things we could not do under certain circumstances, like talking to people over the internet, or learning of foreign countries. Not everyone can do these things, but everyone who has a computer can.	5	5	10
1315	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 this ever happend to you? ""@PERSON3, did you do your research?"" ""@CAPS3, my computer crashed."" ""@PERSON1 did you practice typing @TIME1."" "" @CAPS3, my computer crashed."" "" @CAPS5, why weren't you online @TIME1? I really needed that sales report!"" ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, my computer crashed."" @CAPS6 it @CAPS2, you have realized that computers do benefit people. Whether its doing a class project, practicing for a computers class or exchanging buisness ideas, computers are a big help to society. First of all computers are a big help when it comes to a computer class at your school. There might be a certain speed that a person types and to pass the class, and the teacher could assign practice on your own home computer. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have some kind of personal ocmputer at home get @CAPS7 A's in their computer class. I can back that up as well. In my computers class. our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a little higher. Every @TIME1 I would practice but one @TIME1 my computer crashed, and I could not practice for the whole work with my luch the final exam @CAPS2 on @DATE1 instead of getting a @CAPS8 or A, I got a @CAPS9+. I blame that grade on not having a computer at home. Secondly, computer can be used for learning @MONTH1 different things as well. Maybe on a class report you needed to write something about the traditons of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Instead of running over to the library and wasting your time with a book. You could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet. Not only does it make for less time, but @CAPS6 you look it up on the internet, you will get way more search results than @CAPS6 you search on a library derectory. In addition, by using computers, you can look up the cutomers of a foreign country, or look up programs than could help you learn a new language on computers, you can not only learn about your own country but you can learn about foreign ones. Thirdly, computers can enchance many skills that are needed in the modern buisness word, such as socialization skills communication skills, and even learning about the younger generation. @CAPS6 someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program. They would not make it in the world of today. The people need to learn to intract with each others, and solve problems. @CAPS6 someone is not used intracting with people, they @MONTH1 not make a good buisness man or woman. People must be able to communicate as well @CAPS6 people do not communicate with each other. We will all end up dies in the headlights. We will al be lost and will be able to run buisnesses, or hold meetings, for example I needed to plan at adore for my project group to work on a project, and so I went on my computer hoping they were online basically they never showed and so I could not work with my partners at all. I ended up doing all their work. In conclusion I hope you have absolutely coundered my opinion about the computers have on people like I said, computers can be helpful @CAPS6 comes to computer classes, researching foreigh affairs, and even communicating with others thanks again for even reading this letter."	4	5	9
1320	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a majority of the @ORGANIZATION1 population will use any type of computer at least once a day. Our society has been around computers so often that some peole will find it hard to even live without them. Computers have become something that people depend on. This, however, is something to take as a concern. when people are dependent on computers too much, they loose valuble skills that the once possesed and they spend less time, outside exercising while also loossing touch with famly and friends. It has become near that computers have become along part of peoples lives. Computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place. We used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics. Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it. Today, however, people use technology to find this information. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" @CAPS3, how is this a bad thing?"". The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to loose the ability to use books like encylopedias and atleses or even simmple maps. Once, most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from experienc, that I can barley look at a map and find where I am. We have become too dependent on @CAPS4's and computers, which in turn makes us forget valuble information. What would happen if someone got lost and they didn't have a working @CAPS4 or signal on their phones. They would get lost and not know how to read a map. As you can see the human population has because too dependent on computers. Additionally, people all around the world have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, @CAPS6 and even @CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with. When people begin to spend hte majority of their time on these websites, they will in turn get less excersise, and become more distant from family and friends. Mostly teenagers have this problem. If you took a survay of the number of students who have a facebook account or @CAPS6, you would probably get the majority. Having an account like this is said to be addicting. Students, parents and everyone in between will find troubles later on because of this. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any excersise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing it is now, I bet you there would be less overweight people. but not only do people become overweight, they will end up more and more distant from family and friends. My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. Once, the only way for us to really talk to her through facebook. As you can see, computers can be a dangerous thing. think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably thnks of quiet a few. Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less excersising and less communication which is proven to support a healthy life style. Also when people use computers too much, they loose valueble skills. Remember this next time you are someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them."	5	6	11
1322	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, ""@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends."	5	4	9
1328	1	I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. Therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. For example me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. If we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. Plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. My where you add up and subtract and divide. It's alot less words if you use a computer.	4	4	8
1337	1	Are people today spending to much time on computers. If so had done it affect thous. In our modern day people spend to time on computers. Both me and think that this is affecting people in many different ways. Some ways it by. Health your social life, and also your education. Spending to much time on a pc can effect your in many ways. For example exercise. The people spend all there time siting in a chair they could have a chance of gaining wait. Then you might be getting all the you need because your on the computer you might not go to to get the and veggies. Your want to just so you the computer. Social life @CAPS1, you could have with all the people you are also will them. Another big problem is education. Is you are all day on the computer anything @CAPS2 you it's not on the computer you Those are some of the resons why I think people shouldn't spend to much time on the computer.	4	4	8
1346	1	Dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are good to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in other places or with your family or friends or meet with people from other country and you can become frinds. They are also good because they help to develop cordination on your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. First of all I think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other county or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. You can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls. Secondly the computers are helpful because they help you cordinate your hand and your eye. This helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; You will be able to finish it on time. From your point of view you can actually se were I'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. The hand cordination can help you develop mentally sight. Thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy thing like a clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online. In conclusion I think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to cordinate body parts don't you agree with me?	4	4	8
1369	1	When you use or computer, you have the ability to do virtualy anything. The internet has millions of users and makes life a lot easier. You have acess to talk with people who are all the way across the world! You can search any topic and learn more about it. The internet even encourages you to get outside and see things for yourself. In the @DATE1 it just a seasy to contact someone in @LOCATION1 as it is to contact someone at the other side of town. As long as oyu have a internet connection you can stay in touch with a friend thats moved aparent on a buisness trip, anyone! Some @MONTH1 say that you should just use a phone but you could use video chat on the internet. You can see someone who's thousands of miles away, as if they were right infront of you. These days its harder to not stay in touch than it to stay in touch. @NUM1 or @NUM2 years ago any information you neede came from a book. You would have to go all the way to the library, find the right book, and read it. If you were lucky you could find a bit of what you were looking for. These days you simply type it in to a search browser and you instantly get thousands of webistes on that topic. The internet allows you to learn about any subject you'd like. You can spend @CAPS1 experts or give that some poeple spend too much time on thier computers. Seeing all those great places and beautiful pictures encourages @CAPS1 poeple to get outside and see it for themselves. On a recent poll @PERCENT1 of peopel went on a hike after seeing a youtube video about how great it is to get outside. The internet has a massive effect on us. It can also bring families together. For example at dinner, you can get a great recipe off the internet. In fact, you can get millions of great recipes. The internet was an amazing idea. @CAPS1 would argue that it was the greatest invention ever. Yes, it can be dangerous, but with proper education on it the internet is a good source of information and an @CAPS2 pass-tie, if not abused. Being able to see and talk others so far away was seeminly impossible a few decades ago. Getting information has never been so easy. We are lucky to live in an age where the intenet is right at our fingertips.	5	4	9
1393	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society."	5	6	11
1432	1	The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper just found out that there is a big arguement going on saying that computer are not benefiting society. The other side those who support advances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. Well the @ORGANIZATION1 had to choose a side and the side that they have chosen that computer have a positive affect on people. Yo know why we pick this side because are three reasons why computers are good. Like number one they teach people about far away places and people, @CAPS1 computers are a good sorce of entertainment, and last but not least @CAPS1 computers are good chat room. When @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are finished telling you why these three reason are good the peoples @CAPS1 computer will win this war! First reason is do you like wasting time walking though the library looking for places or @ORGANIZATION1 people. Well if you have a computer you do not have to deal with these all you have to do is go to sarch and put these person or place name and you will see that in less than a min you have information that will take hours to find in a library. I know this because it happen to me looking for a book that talks about the @CAPS2 caladers. I could not find I had to go on a computer for the information. Secound reason why because computers are a good sorce of entertainment. You know if you got bord and you have computer you can easily just go on it and play so many fun games like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, dragonwars, or any fun game that you can find on a computer. There are so many games to chosse from that you will never get borad. Third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family. Like are so many sites that you can chosse to talk to friend or family like @CAPS5, @CAPS6 or even @ORGANIZATION2. Also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family. So go on a computers and talk to your friend even that person a picture or something. My cunclision is I hope you take want I said to heart and chosse want the newspaper have as a dision.	4	4	8
1433	1	Dear local newspaper I think that the effects that computers have on people are that some people become very adictive to them, because some people spend lot of time in the computer doing noting because they just spend their money buying things that they don't need. I also think that computers affect people in the way that they don't spend lot of time with their family. The effects that computers have on people is that some people can't stop using them even if they want. People become very adictive to computers because they spend almost all their time in there. People don't exercise no more because they spend all their time on the computer, shoping things that they don't need they just buy them because they like them. The effects that computers have on people are that some people just to be talking to their friend on myspace. His facebook and other websites that are not good for them. I think that the effects that computers have on people are that they take away people's time because some people spend lot of time on the computers, living their family's alone without spending time with them. Computers take away peoples time because they don't spend time exercising or playing out side with friends or brothers or go to a park to spend same time with their family or have a contact with family and invite some friends to come over to have some good time instead of being in the computer all day without doing nothing. Computer's take away time or love for your family and they make you spend the time that you don't have. The effect's that computers have on people are bad because people can't stop using them even if the wanted to because they are all ready adictive to them. People can't stop using them because in the computers you could do lot's of things like shoping talk to friends and visit websites that have very interesting things from other countries that are very beutiful but some people can't stop using them because they go to play games or because they are down loding music from websites that they don't have to. In conclusion i think that the effects that computers have on people are very bad because some people spend lot of time on them and they even spend the time that they don't have and the time they need. I also think that computers affect people because they don't spend time with their family sharing good things. The effects that computers also have are that people can't step using them because they are adictive to them.	4	4	8
1446	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect. 	5	5	10
1454	1	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1's small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more conected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as uch as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one.	5	6	11
1466	1	Dear @LOCATION1, minute man, people are complaining. They are complaining about how computers interfer with their family and life. But it teaches adults and kids new things. Being on the computer is an exeperince. You can almost search anything on the computer. You can learn history or about the present time. Like one time I was searching (@CAPS1.com) on how to fix a playstation @NUM1 controller. I found out how to do it and it worked. While you are on the computer you can interact with friends, find out about the weather, and find out if you have any homework. The computer also teaches you how to do different stuff. Like this one time I learned to do a hardflip. Also computer's can help you with your homework. Like if you have science homework and you're trying to figure a word out you can search it. Or if you're looking for a book for @LOCATION2 you can search websites for good books or ask a friend. The computer helps many different people in many different ways. And you know how people say computers are bad. If you have a t.v. for game system its like having a computer, right? But don't go kill your self looking for a cheap one. But I do suggest that everyone should have a computer, they are helpful and fun.	4	4	8
1476	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I am awair that more people use computers everyday. I think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them. Computers gives information about the latest and most recient things that happen in other towns contries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn'@CAPS1 see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn'@CAPS1 find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldnt want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you correct with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That @MONTH1 not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friend close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people @MONTH1 dislike them but they have good reasons why. More family time can be but I think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising. Well my time is up here. Hope you liked what I said here and you'll have a passion for computers.	5	4	9
1482	1	More people tend to use computer's more than going outside enjoying the weather, and I think people should less time on the computer and more time interacting with whom ever. People spend most of their time talking to people on any websites/playing online games. I think that it's a bad habit, people of all ages spend their time doing that when they can do something fun, but chose not to. Parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous. There has been many people who have been hired. Raped in websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many other dangerous websites. In be more I would say that children and adults talk to strangers and think they know that personso well, meet them some place and get killed or anything because many people lie they age. And who know that person can be a fiftey year old woman or man. Say their a teen and end up finding you That is why parents should not be let their children be on period of time and should be on. While you reading this I hope you understand why it's rong and take my suggestion under and help us young kids to (thank you)	4	3	7
1483	1	To: @CAPS1 this letter concerns, Computers are apart of our daily life. You can do many things on them such as play games, watch videos, search the web, and even communicate with people from all over the world. They are very useful for people who go to school bacause you can complete and save work for your classes. Sure maybe some people are addicted to the computer but others use it only when they need to. Computers have a massive affect on some peoples life. Sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but informative in many ways. One of the informative ways is that you learn new information every time you log on. That is why I think the computer has a great effect on people.	3	3	6
1487	1	Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or whatever you talk to your friends are. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be much interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but thats not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there, but then what would be the fun of that. For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, dont you feel great when your going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful I am thankful to god of giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, georgus. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else or even riding your @CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but beacuse of the computer they got that wich really stinks. Now as you can you see computers really can change your life. So that's your discision. Pick wrong from right, all up to YOU. Now make it.	4	4	8
1509	1	Hi my name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing to the local news paper to say that computers are good for people and helps alot like how to get one place two another, how to learn about black history or famous people that did something to the world, and how to find out the news and weather from home or at work, how to keep your besnness going without computers their jobs would be hopless, and like of your family or you tyring to make it in life and the only way to get in contact would be the computers there are computers every where even doctors use them at a hospital to keep people alive to see what wrong with them and where they came from, and one more jobs need computers to, to see if the person is capable for the job so they might look for background information with out it even you would not have a good job so hee are some resons why computers are important. One of them is we need computers for so that we can get around, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers. There lots of more stuff that coulf have said that prove computers are good and why we need them but i just had to cut it short and schools need computers the most to take test on the computers of they have to, so thats all the resons why we need computer and why they are good bye.	4	4	8
1536	1	"Some people don’t like computers because of instant reason, and other people like computers little too much. I like computers but @CAPS1 not obsess with computers give good efforts on people, even me you can learn things off the computer and you start to get good hand eye coordination one of the things I like about the is that you can 'talk"" to other people. Lots of people uses the computer a little too much that they dont exercise, or watch nature as much some normal (other) people should, and they dont spend them with their familys. I rather spend time on the computer for only (#@NUM1) three hours so then I can do other things with my time and you or anybody should do the same."	2	2	4
1538	1	A lot of people use computers today. But not everybody thinks they benifit society. But computers can do anything! You can do reaserch, you can play games, and most of all, be free. Were you ever given a school project to do, but no book has the information you want? Well the internet does. A lot of computers are connected to the interact where you can find anything! Are you trying to find facts for your science project? Just go on your favorite search engine and search your topic. You'll find endless pages on anything. Even if your not doing school work, you can find anything on the internet. Did you forget the number of your favorite football player? Search his name and it'll tell you right on your screen. Are you wondering why the @CAPS1 won the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Your choices are endless! Even if your computer doesn't have internet, you can play games. Playing games on your computer is a great hobbie! And if you are connected to the internet, you can play games with other people around the world. Playing games on your computer is a great hobbie, but you cant play all the time, you need to find other things to do to. There are a variety of computer games. Adventure games, shooting games multiple player games, and more! You can even play poker on your computer. I think the best part of any computer is your freeness while on one. You can do almost anything. You can go on the internet, play games and even talk with people. You can also customize your computer to your liking. Do you have a picture of your cat? You can put it as your background on the desktop. Want a different curser, you can change that to! You can change anything you want with just a click on your mouse. There you go, there are endless possibilities with computers. You can learn, play, and be free. But the most important part of using a computer is to enjoy it, and have fun!	4	5	9
1539	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 personal experience, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Many people enjoy their time on the computer because, with today's technology so many things can be done and quicker too. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a computer at home. I do and its just great. I got most things done and in a matter of time. I think computers have a positive effect on people because today you can do almost anything. For example, I have family in @LOCATION2; @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION4, and instead of calling them on the phone, I could video chat with them and it feels like you're actually there. Also, now you can pay your bills online, and instead of sending a letter through mail and waiting when it will arrive and having to buy stamps that are extremely expensive, you could just simply send on e-mail-free of charge. Most college students do their homework on the computer. They type essays, or while doing research on someone or something, they could just save it and take notes on it later. So basically a computer is almost a part of everyone's life and it can be entertaining, fun, and used for more important things. What I'm trying to say is computers are a part of every teenagers routine during the day. We like to interact with our friends and listen to music and bond with family and other realtives who you don't usually contact all on one piece of technology. Some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something. Computers are important, a computer will scan this test of mine and give me a score, so I think now you will agree with me now when I say computers have had and always will have a positive effect on people. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my opinion and I hope you agree.	5	4	9
1557	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 tired, lazy people sitting on their computer and wasting their life bacause of it. The issue to with is do you think that people are spending to much time on the computer or not. I strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer. And, here are @CAPS2 reasons why, people are spending less time exercising, people not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt you probably know that exercising is at least somewhat helpful to life, @CAPS4 if people are sitting home @NUM1 on the computer with no exercise, it is going to cause people to gain an excess amount of wait. Because the more they just sit around. And do nothing except the computer. The more they're going to be and the more lazy they're going to be. So they're not going to want to do anything and really it's just a waist of life. And, in some cases it can cause depression. Just ask a local resident who says "" @CAPS2 mom used to be on the computer all the time and did nothing with her life,"" and @CAPS3 she became depressed. And, soon after, killed herself."" @CAPS3 more and more people are going to become like. I know that a lot of people like to be outside when its a nice sunny day. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 somebody on that day in a room, with their eyes to the computer screen. Because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 if that was someone you loved. Doing that with their life. I'm pretty sure you would try to do something to help them get off that path. Just ask another local resident @PERSON1 who says, ""I remember coming home everyday, and there was @CAPS2 mom, no shades up, pitch block, it was like a dark cave, and she would sit there for hours on the computer wasting her life, and I remember asking her how long has it been since you've gone outside, she answered, its been almost two months."" @CAPS4 I know from @CAPS2 family that there was a family member of mine who was a ""computer junkie"" And, I remember at a family get together @CAPS2 aunt was the only one who could never come. Because she was to busy on the computer. And, she"	4	4	8
1566	1	"Hello my name is @PERSON1 @CAPS1 and I am going to enforce you that computers can benefit our society. First, @CAPS3 allows students to easily get good grades on projects and reports. Second, You can make online job applications. Lastly, computers allow people to chat with other people. Firstly, the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports. They help children's reports because for example they are doing a report on ""@CAPS2 lincon"" they have access to look up the peron to get information they need right at home. Doing reports with their computer there is no need to use up your projects you can also look up information and print out pichers to make your project more vibrant and eye-catching to younger people. Also @CAPS3 allows you to type your information to make @CAPS3 look orginzed and neet. Accordly, if you are trying to find some job applications without wasting your time, just look on the internets. This way you want go to place not knowing if jobs are available and seeing none. Also @CAPS3 save your to save the trip out there. You are able to look up the paying of the job and regulations, and you can find out if you get the job fastered. Lastly, @CAPS3 allows socializing. For example like facebook or/and myspace lets you talk to friends from school or friends you met online. For adult who don't have a myspace or facebook account they can use email, msn, aol, aim/aol instant messager, or via chat. This way adults can catch up on work and children can kee in touch with friends or/and family. This is why @CAPS3 think computer with internet benifit our society projects, reports, job appicatrone and spcializing with family and friends."	4	4	8
1572	1	Dear to @CAPS1 this @MONTH1 concern, Computers do a whole lot now of days. You can play games, do homework, socialize but don't you think there are better things than that. Such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly interacting with family and friends. These are all the things that computers take away from people. Once you get onto a computer you never want to get off. If you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. So if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight. Computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising. That is not good for your health at all. Exercising gives you energy and is good for you. Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? When your on the computer chit-chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what your missing. Everytime I use the computer I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature. Trees, flowers, plants, grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't apreciate those things. So next time your on the computer think about that. While your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. Would you like to be that child who doesnt have a family or any type of friends? Lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen anyday. So I believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends. Even if its just having a conversation do it, maybe it can show them that you really care. In conclusion, I think that computers are a waste of time. I understand how people say it is used to comunicate with people but back then they didnt have computers and they communicated so we can to. Computes make you spend less time exercising, keeps you from enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family and friends. You won't go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday.	4	4	8
1573	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 are you? As for me I am fine. I am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons why I am writing this letter is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places, computers helps you leran more about different parts of the world and also computers helps people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. First of all why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places. An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places. And they cannot have a good contack with them. But if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the @LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in @LOCATION1 you could have a with I have families that lives and @LOCATION1 and it is hard to them. But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advices. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new resipie and you are not sure on @CAPS3 to make it. And it will give you the inderigant and direction to make that food or snack you want. That's why I believe that you and all others should believe that computers have a positive effects. In conclusion why you should believe that computers have a positive effect is that people could contack with friends and families, computers helps you learn about different parts of the world, and also computers helps you learn and understand more about life. I would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people. That's why you should believe that computers have positive effect on people. 	5	5	10
1580	1	Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a @ORGANIZATION2 student and I hear that some people think it is good to use computers and others think that its a waist of time. Well I have @NUM1 good reasons as to why computers are good technology. One reason is you can book places that you want to go or the sights you want to see. This is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route you can even print a map and go hiking. (hows that for excersing). Another reason why computers are good to use is because of online chats. Let's say that you have a family member that lives all the way out in @LOCATION1 and they have a computer and you want to talk to them but it costs you to talk, you can e-mail. This is a good way to use the computer because you can stay updated on what is going on with your family members. Another reason is learning. You can learn about many different cultures. You can learn about different people and how they live their life and ther cultures. My last reason is the @CAPS1. This is a great way to use the computer because you can keep updated on the lafest things like the earthquake in hati; or a hurricane or a @CAPS1 breaking story. Or if their is a storm headey your way. In conclusion, using the computer has great ways to be used and sure people, put some bad sights out their but if you use it the right way it is a good source of technology!	4	4	8
1595	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is they help make every day life easyier. First off, you can chat with people from long distances. Also, it makes home work, and finding information a lot easyier as well. Last but not least when you have nothing else to do, you can play games, and watch videos from online. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with @CAPS1 friends. Even if the are across the country, you can still chat with them, for free! Also, if you can't get in touch with them, you can send them a @CAPS2-mail, and as soon as they log on, they will get your message. Best of all, when you forget to write your home work down, you can go online, and ask one of your friend what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is make a word document, and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer, and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it teaches hand-eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games, that any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easyier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes home work much easyier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when there bored, or have nothing to do. I strongly belive that computers have a positive effect on people, because of all the things they offer, and help us on. Thank you.	4	4	8
1631	1	"I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the "" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives @NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games. And lastly you want your daughter to go to yale or do you want her to fail. I have give yous you the facts the rest is up to you."	4	4	8
1639	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other. If someone doesn't have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @CAPS2 well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also cames in handy when you have nothing to do. If you're bored and can't play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, @CAPS2 well @CAPS2 keep you busy. If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained, you can go on @CAPS3 or other sites and find any song you want to hear. It's better than listening to the radio because sometimes you don't like the song that's giving. If you're also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document or if you just want to type whats on your mind. @CAPS2 you can see, I think the computer is a facinating tool to use. You can communicate, learn new things, and keep yourself entertained if you're not able to do something active. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family.	5	5	10

1643	1	To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping and even enterteinment. Sounds great right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it.	6	5	11
1645	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @DATE1, computers are a big part of our society. They are an advance in technology, and they have some positive effects. However, computers have more negative effects on people. They take away and diminish @CAPS3 time, interacting with family, and seeing the world. First, computers have a negative effect on people because they diminish @CAPS3 time. People are so caught up with computers, their desire for @CAPS3 starts to fall. According to a @ORGANIZATION3 survey in @DATE2, for @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer a week (roughly @NUM2 hours each day) had an increase in cholesterol and slowly deterioating muscles. ""Computers distract people from their needs"" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people get this amount."" The leading cause for this low number? ""technology,"" she says, ""@CAPS2 computers, which take away all of the motivation and time people need to @CAPS3."" @CAPS3 is vital, and computers are taking this away from society. People shouldn't have bad @ORGANIZATION1 because of this negative effect: computers. Second, computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family. @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people say that computers take away from their family time, reports Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. This is not of all good, especially since @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to eat up time, it also cuts of communication, something extremeley important in graving children. with this, family bonds and relationship are ruined as wal. It affects interacting with family, and puts hates in family bonds: computers haved negative effect on people. Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world. When you're on the computer, it seems like the entire world is in your computer screen. But its not. This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notedly become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net. The cure? Traveling, or even talking walks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of their world in which they live. They have to make important descions for themselves, their children, even their country, and staring at a computer screen wont help at all. It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, it takes away from people seeing the world, something actually very important because it affects people's desicion making as well as future generations. People need to realize these bad effects, and majorly decrease their computer usage."	6	5	11
1652	1	Dear local news paper, @CAPS1 computers is a good idea because every developed country uses computers. Also they @CAPS2 learning, fertileze comunication, and are comercialy implortant. Computors also make life easier for many people. Computers @CAPS2 learning by let vast of information being available. I personaly find out about many world events just by bringing up yahoo.com. Computers alow me to learn about new @NUM1, learning about cultures all over the world can be done by computers. The last way computers @CAPS2 learning is by informing us about everyday thing like to get a stain out, how to pronounce a word, how to make a new dish, and much more. Computers are also crucial to communictaion. We use computers to talk to our freinds on facebook. You can also meet new people useing a pc. Everyone uses computer so you can basicly meet enyone. The last reason computers are important is for the commercial stand point computer help alot of small bussness out by letting than be known. Domestic seller and huge companies can compette for the same customer. Furthermore the internet generates alot money for people becausethey can use it as a cyber billboard. In conclusion the computer is usefull because of learning, communication, and comercial. Therefore the computer should be supported and not looked down upon.	4	4	8
1691	1	Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 your workers wake up in the @TIME1, they stretch their right muscles and put on their puzzy slippers. They wonder down the hailway and open their @CAPS2 book air to check the weather for today. They go on @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, and etc. to view their e-mails sent from work friends, and family. They check the time on the bootom of the laptop screen and lag onto to play some they are getting ready. Society today relies heavily on computers and the net work their keeps us all connected... the incorect with technological advances happening today, people are now using computers to help with their work. But is that a some @MONTH1 say that it is due to the fact the amount of spent on the computer is the much and that it stop from with friends but it does computers help with the skill of typing, help with fast end easy and helps friends and @NUM2. of through @NUM2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc I believe that computers have a possitive affect on people and once a great addition to society. to begin, computers help to reach @CAPS6, children, and even adults the skill of typing. Statistics show that more and more jobs on computers and hire people with a higher words per minute ability with almost @PERCENT1 of adopting new computer and using computers to store information to their company, computers are necesity and so is the knowledge of understanding computers and being able to type. Moreover, @CAPS6 these days are depending on computers for research to order to do projects and information I can personally connect to this because being a student on @LOCATION1 school, I am assigned project what involve typed words and or information. how hand it would I had to hand writs all of my work and on the for information. @CAPS1 multiple @CAPS6 are assigned the same project, the does not millon @CAPS6 to check looks out @CAPS5 there was no computer to use, what would I do? for @CAPS6, computers and a great thing. Furthermore, @CAPS6 and even adults enjoy social time, but @CAPS1 friends are family line faraway or you are not able to visit three, the computer connect in handy computer help to keep friends and family connected through @CAPS3, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 / or @NUM1, I.M / @PERSON1, and webcam video chats. All of those computer related things would not there for @CAPS5 there were no computer. Would you want no be disconected from family and being social is a key part of being You why shouldnt we keep them and why with all of these possitive things about computer would ever make you doubt them? In computers are wonderful things. They he is to build skill of typing, help and it easy, and also help keep and family connected. Computers affect people only good ways and help everday life be easy. so, believe that computers are a great thing and that without them, even just talking to family could be jeaporadized. Lets keep computers	6	5	11
1718	1	Losing @CAPS1 to @ORGANIZATION1 are a huge part of daily life these days, which is good for businesses, and schools but for people just looking to pass time, computers are a dangerous choice. Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment, but when it comes to boredome computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Also excersise is a big issue now and you aren't getting any by at a computer. On the other hand though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public. Also these w ebsites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Other pass time could be running on a tredmill or jogging there dont have benefits. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day but not using to the internet. Websites can be a way to find computer time. Edline is homework or an assignment. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive. Overall, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people if as many people that use computers balanced that time with time to excersise, they would all be better off.	5	4	9
1735	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The issue before us is that people are addicted to computer. S I think we are not. In addition to all this some people can task and many things like hang out with there family and friend but most importantly enjoy life. In a way computer privliges can be as like your enjoying life. Say if you an your friend has the same computer which includes webcam, video messaging and more. That's life well what im trying to say is that yall can talk see each other, have private conversations. Computer's dont alway take you away from the important people or things in life. Some computers can help you, you can take school, learn how to write essays, learn how to read, and much more. Computers can be a success to some people. Only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer. Imagine life without a computer what would you do? How can you survive? For example if you were giving some homework that you had to do on the computer and theres was no way for you to do that project in school. How would you do it? Some people need computers. I think if they thought and knew we was going to get so excited about how cool our computers' are they shouldnt so much new technologies in our life. Now you can probably see why I think we need computer and how it can sometime benefit our society.	4	3	7
1738	1	Dear readers, People around the world are starting to use computers now more, often, but theirs also people that dont agree that it benefits society, @CAPS1 not one of those people. I agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is because sometimes theirs teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they cant contact them in any other way. Another reason is because in all school teacher give their students project to do over vacation or weekends, for the projects they can look for information in the computer. The last reason is because computers can give ability to learn more about things they didnt know before. In my opinion I agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids and even adults would like to talk with their friends so they can get on the computer and chat with them if theirs no other way to contact them, @CAPS2 easy. You only have to @NUM1) get in the computer, @NUM2) get into a site were you know your friend might be @NUM3) log in or register in if you never been into that site @NUM4) last but not least look @NUM4 your friend to chat will teachers always give their students work for example like projects. Kids also do projects on weekends or vacation and so you dont have to go to a library to check out a book you could always get on the computer and look for the information you need their. Computers give you abilitys to learn information you didnt know before for example if your bored and you dont got nothing to do get in the computer and look up information about things like nature, books your looking for etc. I agree with computers benefiting society but not everyone, @NUM3 reason why I agree is kids can chat online with their friends, look up information for projects and find information they never knew about, what do you think @CAPS1 I right or wrong.	4	3	7
1745	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 years computers didn't exist, but now many people are having internet in their homes. But to some, the effect its giving on the people is negative. However, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. Such as, the internet allows people to keep in touch, gives them technology skills to prepare them @CAPS1 more hi-tech jobs; and allows them to find and learn about new things. Dont you think computers help society? People live in all parts of the world, and those that are lucky get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country. But, you can't talk on the phone due to long-distance calls; so with a computer people don't have to lose touch! Its quite easy @CAPS1 people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them. Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family, too. Therefore, people can talk to their distant relatives from all over when you don't even have to go visit them. Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch. Lets face it, the world is relying more and more on technology and computers. But, if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job. Lots of jobs ask @CAPS1 technological skills in order to be hired; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults @CAPS1 life. Besides that, there is a computer injust about every work place that is up-to-date; restaurants, hotels, retail stores. and even in construction business. Nevertheless, computer skills aren't just a good skill to have; they are a necessary skill. Last, Computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics. Instead of looking through various books and encyclopedias @CAPS1 researching, why not search the topic? Although, the computer and internet shouldn't completely replace books, it is a valuable researching tool. Someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures, ancient history on them, and learn so much. Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house. Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people. @CAPS1 the reasons of keeping intouch, giving	5	5	10
1748	1	Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don't fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines.	4	5	9
1749	1	Dear newspaper, I think that computers are great for researching things like for a car or sereach for people places and thing. @ORGANIZATION1 are great because you keep in touch with you family and friends. Like you can email them webcam chat and you can instant message them.I think a lot of people should get into @ORGANIZATION1 because you can do everything on them. You can save you picture, download music, play games. People say that some people spend to much time on the @ORGANIZATION1 well i think they should because they should learn new and different things about different countrys city or even states. I don't think there is noting wrong about spending time on a @ORGANIZATION1.	3	3	6
1760	1	I think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversal issue. In my opinion, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. For instance, it's not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet. Also, people spend too much time in front the computer now a days, @CAPS1, its a major distraction and also a negetive effect on kids. school work. It's now or never! Do we dicide that computers have a negetive effect? You decide! Isn't every parents biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up. Would you want your child veiwing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like @CAPS2.com one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least @NUM1 to have a @CAPS2, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users lie about their age? And it's not always a @NUM4 year old saying they are @NUM1, it could be a @NUM6 year old saying they're @NUM7! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are. Is this the kind of internet exposer you want for your children? Put a stop to this right now! More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are overweight and unhealthy. This is another negetive effect computers have on people. It's a gorgeous @DATE1 day. Bright blue skies, cotton candy cloulds, the sun is shining, and there's a nice warm breece. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! None people would @CAPS5 be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would @CAPS5 spend hours on facebook. This is a serious concern to our health. People don't exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! Instead of playing video games onlin, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun beighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step @CAPS3 need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn't you agree? Did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negetive effects of a computer this will @CAPS5 than coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study. So you do! Take action now, or your child will definately suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe Computers have a negative effect on people? It's clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negetively affect children's grades. Don't wait another minute! Let's agree and do something about this!	6	6	12
1765	1	Dear local Newspaper I ting that computers are good because u get to learn about other people like famous people that deid a long time ago. Computers are good because u get to learn about other places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, texas. Learning about other places is fun. Having a computer is good because u get to serf the web you could play games, see and alot of other times you will like. You could talk to frends from far. Talking from mySpace or yahoo and other website that you could talk to tiferent people that you met trew the wed.	2	3	5
1766	1	"Man has always been interested in technology. Computers are just one part. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, saves trees, and allows people to learn about everything. Hand-eye coordination is a key part in our every day lives. Driving a car or writting all invile hand-eye coordination. I remember a few years ago I didn't have a great hand-eye coordination I had trouble catching a ball. Now days I spend up to on hour and a half on the computers. I have noticed my hand get neater and I can catch a balls with ease now. Do you want to be the one to crash your car because you have bad hand-eye coordination? Computers not only increase your hand-eye coordination they save trees too. Using a computer dosn't need any paper. You can read and write with out using a single sheet of paper. Since the computer @PERCENT1 of tree cutting has stopped. Saving trees help us stay alive. Trees put out the oxegyn that we breath in. Some say that computers are causing people to spend less time enjoying nature. I think that if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't have much nature to enjoy anyway. Lastly computer help people all around the world learn about almost anything. I scince kid, the head scientist says that ""with the computer we are able to toll the world of our discoveries much."" @CAPS1. @PERSON1 say ""@CAPS2 many people are laying had their die to the computer, they learn @CAPS2 many nutrition facts from the health sites"". Thanks to the computer we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed. The average people can learn about non average things any day. There are even dictionarys on the internet with many diffent translations that you would normily need about @NUM1 books to do. The computer is one of the greatest techlonagicly advances to this day. It has help our world is @CAPS2 many different ways too. Hand-eye coordination is @CAPS2 important and is preserving our environment. If you don't have knowledge you cant get anywhere in life. Our whole world senses is. "	4	4	8
1770	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren't even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, ""where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment."	5	5	10
1783	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 several reasons on way I that advances in technology are harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers on the outside world. Its also takes you away from family and friends. Lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet. One of my severl reasons on way I feel advanced technology is harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers @CAPS2 teens, adult's and etc. The probem with this is that you never really know whos on the other side of that door, that chat room people can miss guide you into thinking there someone who there not. @CAPS2 example theres a show called dateline. This show is about how young teens put there selev's online and grown or young men click on a picture of you and that opens up a chat line or as I say opening a door, you dont know who's on the other side of that door. So these men online makes these teens trust them and make them feel safe if they are a friend you ""hey can I come over sometime?"" you this young teen thinking thats your friend says yea sure. Dont forget you dont see his picture so he come's over and most of three men are looking @CAPS2 a quick fix. If you know what I mean. This is what go's on during dateline t.v show just imarge how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing the difference is they dont get caught. Secondly on why is harmful to our socitey is because it takes you away from your family and friends. It takes you away from your kid's family because that will start to fill as if you love that computer more then them. It take you away friends because they might say hey let's go out to the mall or @CAPS2 a drink youll probably say check up on somethings online. This will one move slowly away from you, all over a computer you will start to lose the people most important to you. My last reason on why you can harm society with teconogly is because it takes you away from living your own life and doing thing's you wanna do like online is a bunch of stuff that everybody else say's is cool. Do what you think and feel is cool. @CAPS2 example if someone posted something saying @NUM1 guys lodon is so cool you gotta go there but youve always wanted to go to @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 thing is that you do get to have enough air outside like your skin will get pail and icky and this is why I feel that way. In covlsion all though some people might think that advanced tencogly is good well cleary there not because they open doors to danger, take you away from friends and family. Also it takes you away from what life has to offer."	4	4	8
2997	2	I think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library. All the bad books, music, magazines and movies no one really wants to read. If a kid picks up the book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies that would be bad to read. If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies, music or magazines. If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from. There are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books.     There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read. There are things like books that talk about sex. There can also be language that the kids should not read. I know for sure, that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older.         There are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to. There is things like sex songs. There are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it. I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that, I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs.     There is also movies that I don't want my kids to watch, because of the content of the movie. There are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all have something to do with sex. Latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate.      Their is one more thing that I think is very important, which is magazines. There are many things that can happen in magazines like porn. I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn. I think in general we should get rid of porn, and descusting pictures in magazines.	3	3	3
2999	2	I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 them. Some @CAPS1 feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having. @CAPS1 often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those @CAPS1 can get the books and @CAPS2 them to help them solve there problems.     If the books etc are offensive then, the @CAPS1 who think they are shouldn't get them. The can't control what books are in the library. Some @CAPS1 have problems and some of the books can help them. Alot of @CAPS1 I know dont think that alot of books are offensive. Its eather they want to @CAPS2 them or they dont.      If @CAPS1 think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it. @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 all kinds of books and some dont even like to @CAPS2. For the @CAPS1 who like to @CAPS2 they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with. If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to @CAPS2.      I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. Im sure that they wont do anything about it. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For @CAPS1 To @CAPS2', and to understand what there life is and how to fix it.      You have to control under the books. You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf. In conclusion I think that @CAPS1 should deal with it because they cant control it	3	3	3
3000	2	Hello, my name is @CAPS1, I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries.  If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media.  People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like they are able to put it back on the shelf.  People say The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1, that is completly speculated it's all a matter of 'he said she said.'  I feel there should be sections for different sections for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un-@CAPS5.     There should be a parent supervising children @NUM1 and younger, because where it really comes to are the children and them not being exposed to something there not ready for.  There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in librarys, and those are as follows: pornography, non-educational movies, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and social networks.     I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace but, shouldn't some leeway on books.  This is an approved message thank you for your time, goodbye.	3	3	3
3020	2	Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even @NUM1 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too.     Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else.     In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading.     Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.          All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc.     But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 thier children get away with everything.      One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world.     So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them. Please think about what I have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this	4	4	4
3026	2	Have you ever been offended? Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality.     You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?     If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book.     The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed?	4	4	4
3054	2	Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive? Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them? @CAPS2 is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into:     If one person finds a @CAPS1 offensive but no one else does, should @CAPS2 be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions. This is because they know people like @CAPS2 and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find @CAPS2 offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have @CAPS2 removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item.     If the library removes the offensive item, they @MONTH1 lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they @MONTH1 lose a customer. So they are faced with a dillemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' @CAPS2's a tough decision to make especially when they @MONTH1 lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They @MONTH1 poll the customers and see what they think, they @MONTH1 do nothing at all, or they @MONTH1 remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if @CAPS2's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love @CAPS2 so much, but can't afford to buy @CAPS2 at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' @CAPS3 is they just don't want to agknowladge other people's' choices, feelingings, opinions, etc.     So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for @CAPS2 to be removed? Say nothing? @CAPS2 is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do. So think about other people's' possible feelings, thoughts, opinions in mind before making a decision.	3	4	3
3068	2	I believe that if there are offensive books,music,movies,and magazines are in the libraries. I think they should be taking off the shelf , @CAPS1 people should not want there children's reading or looking at thing they should not be looking at. Today I'm going againt the views on the censorship in the libraries.      I think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the build for our children to read. The materials that the libraries has that are offensive should be put up in another area for older poeple. Not for the children's that go to the libraries. I'm asking the newspaper to help us to fight for what the libraries should have on there shelf for our young people and are children's.      And  what type's of book should be in the children part in the libraries on the shelf. We should have right's to take off book's on  the children side. And have rights to put offensive materials on the side for older people that like books,music,movies,and magazines but not for young children to read. The point I'm trying to make is that we should think about what our children's should be learn.     And what they should know as a young person. They should not grow up to fast like some people are .We need to make the better for our young children's. So they can do the same for there self and for there children's some day.	2	2	2
3077	2	It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press. Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us? Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things? Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devestated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time.     My ninth grade year in high school, I read 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' by @PERSON1. This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the @LOCATION4 during the earlier years of the @LOCATION1. This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern @LOCATION1; one could say this book steriotypes people in the @LOCATION4. One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses. African-@CAPS6 could be offended by the explicit rascist comments and names within the pages. Despite this, 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' is considered a classic and is praised and tought throughout the @LOCATION1 and the rest of the world. I grew from reading @PERSON1's masterpiece- it tought me a lot about where the @LOCATION1 has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races. You learn from your mistakes, they say. Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes. We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention. We can stop history from repeating itsself by being well-informed.     Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures; @CAPS9 or @CAPS10'ite, @LOCATION2, @CAPS11, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION5, @CAPS12. Any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '@ORGANIZATION1,' which focuses on @CAPS13. Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music. Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes.Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them. It could limit one's exploration of interests. It could very well take away from one's personal growth.     In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion. Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society. Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be. It is best to just keep things the way they are- free.	5	4	5
3102	2	Picture yourself walking through the library with your child. Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song.      I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as '@CAPS1' do not reach their shelves.     Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think?     In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment.	3	4	3
3104	2	The media is destroying our youth! this is something we hear everyday. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning.     If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.     Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more.      Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see.  If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see.     Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives. If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop. They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship	5	5	5
3124	2	Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? The question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves. I don't think they should.     I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. You can make that desicion. No one is making you watch or read any of that.     I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I choose to read them. No one forced the act on me.     Some of you @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature.     There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be bare.     You have a choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves.	4	4	4
3131	2	Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it?     Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things.     Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent.      Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libaries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child.	4	4	4
3135	2	Okay, to me, people are way to moral in the modern world, i was taught that if you have a problem keep it to yourself. Most of everyone know that censorship is a big deal but it doesnt have to be. I know that somethings are a little, risque, but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution. Your probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a 'better solution'? Lets talk about children and this content, if you get this out there quicker and subtlely, the children wont see the need to find out what it is at a later age. If that was to happen the conseqences could be fatal, such as; fines, misdemenors, respect, reputation, and even some time in jail. Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general, they are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older. Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community, yea i know what your thinking, why not do that? If more people in your community are nicer, when a real threat comes, whos gonna help? The @CAPS1? who knows, it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around, even longer if your in a city. In that time, some one could have died, been robbed and that same criminal gone. So, if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on, people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be benifical. Anyways, what im trying to say is, if you take this away from us, people will become weaker, if you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good	3	3	3
3150	2	Freedom of press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown. To censorize the right to write freely about ones outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past.     Before todays technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to recieve one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information, they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone.      In the brilliant novel, @CAPS1 @NUM1 a man who lives in a distopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediatly taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and distruction as in the novel.      Having the right to know about your countries history or what is going on in your current government is critical in shools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf perminatly, there would be no more books. Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good.      Books are a history in themselves, no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavory or the possibility of a complete government take over. In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply chose a more ficition novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, however they can exagorate certain events and without the actual book or cite it came from, one could completely alter the publics view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it.      Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off ones talent is a privlage. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrevelent, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always strech the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people. The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades	4	4	4
3151	2	The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time. Libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material. Children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to because it's their life. Books, magazines, music, and movies can teach young people about life and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard on entertaining the people..      The materials found 'offensive' should not be removed. These materials can be found helpful to others. Reading material can help a young person with life. If the reader is having problems and needs help, it is possible the book he/she is reading @MONTH1 help them in the thinking process on what they should do. The books, movies, and music have been made by extremely hard workers, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive.      One of the many times i went to the library I was looking for a book I had read before but I could not find it. I could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf. This hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read. Some books found 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read. Why take it off the shelf? People are being too much self-centered. They care about themself and that is it.      The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining. If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not the shelves. Freedom of the @CAPS1 states that the anybody has the right to write whatever the he/she wants to write.  If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves then we're going to get to the point to where there are no books on any shelf	3	3	3
3161	2	I believe that libraries shouldnt be censored becuase people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this becuase everyone takes offense to something, If people can't find what they're looking for then why go to the library, also everybody likes diffrent things. I'll support them in the following paragraphs.     Have you ever read or seen something that u took offense to you or others? normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them. If people where to take away things that offended them in librarys what would be left of the shelfs? dust? Becuase there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is diffrent. This is one reason I support no on censorship becuase there would be nothing left.     Also everyone tends to like many diffrent things. I @MONTH1 like something you could possibly hate, should it not be aloud in a library becuase you don't like it? No, becuase something you like could be taken away by someone else. So if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like this would be another thing were nothing would be left. I think that becuase if we combined everyones things that they hate, it would most likely be everything.     These two subjects bring me to my last reason, if people cant find what they want. Becuase it was taken away, why come to a library? People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet and librarys would become empty like there shelfs. Then it was a waste of money to make the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians. Thats wasted tax dallors we could have used for something better.     After reading all my reasons and opinions I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries. becuase everyone is offended by something, everyone likes diffrent things, and noone would use a library if what they liked wasn't there. some people @MONTH1 disagree with me becuase they're one of these people being offended or not liking something. But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what there for, allow people to read, research, adn watch what the want.	3	3	3
3170	2	I dont think we should not take books, Music, Movies, and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us. If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me.     Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like. One of them is @CAPS1 Books I hate them with all of my heart. The next kind of books that I think is offensive is @CAPS2 Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read. So I think that it is a wast of paper. The last kind of books I think is offensive is @CAPS3 Books because they are hard to read them in @CAPS3.     Their are lot's of music out there I dont like. One of them is @CAPS5. I dont know why I dislike @CAPS5 but I do. The next type @CAPS6- @CAPS7. The singer in todays @CAPS6- @CAPS7 I think are no good. The last type of music is some of todays rap. I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words.     Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like. The first one is @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I did not get the hole plut of that movie. The next one @CAPS12 of the corn. Their was no way I could find out way the @CAPS12 was killing the people over @NUM1 in that town. The last movie that I did not like was ALL the @CAPS13 movies. I just did not like them ok?     I think all of these things are offensive. But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away. There are thing people like but I dont like them. Their things that my friend like but I dont like. Their thing I like and they dont like. But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like. But you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world	3	3	3
3194	2	Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. ' In this quote I think she was trying to get across that if someone picks up a book or a magazine and reads it and then puts it back and maybe its not the best book ever to them and they @MONTH1 find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they @MONTH1 not find it offensive, then you have two different view points on a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but to another it @MONTH1 not be. Different view points really effect how to censor books, because of how people are so different, there difference on how they feel about a book could effect what should happen to that book.     I dont believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone. If they are found offensive to a bunch of different people then yes they should be removed, but if its only bothering one or two people but there are other people that agree that its not offensive, then dont get rid of it just because of a couple people. Take a vote maybe to see how many people agree and dissagree on keeping or getting rid of it then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it off of that vote. I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it. If someone has a memory about something they read or remember an experience from it and then someone else reads it and feels offened by something its not fair to the other person to get rid of it. Its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences.     So dont  remove books just because a couple people might find it offensive, take a vote to decide. Let more than just a few people deciede on behalf of the book. More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what differnt views you @MONTH1 find from different people on just one book. People need to be able to discuss their veiws on the book and then bedate on whether or not to keep it, so dont choose to get rid of them without several view points on the book.	3	3	3
3204	2	Dear newspaper and staff,               @CAPS1 has came to my attention that @CAPS1 is being considered that most libraries in the community @MONTH1 have a removal and or censorship of some books in the libary. I find this not accepable; in my opinion this is a attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offenisve reading material from futher generations. For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labled ' A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1', this book describes a childs heartships and the abuse he takes on a daily basics. Books of this sort are not only imformitive @CAPS1 also gives the reader an open mind on how things might have been. Some topics @MONTH1 include; slavery, abuse, war, and discrimation.                These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society. Censoring and removal of these book are pointless; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue. @CAPS1 is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships, problems, and lessons in which these topics araised. Without imforming our generations of these issues @CAPS1 could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent!          My opinion on movies however are a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material. Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that @MONTH1 be offesive or perhaps discrimating. They @MONTH1 also need adult combinations to preview the movie.           So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues. I just fully believe open @ORGANIZATION1 content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed. I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks!                                              Sincerly,                                                                                     @PERSON1- @ORGANIZATION1	3	3	3
3211	2	All people have the same right to read, listion and watch different materials. To be censored should be no one choise but your own. For some one else to tell you what and what not to read is by my openion very wrong to do. If we would censore everything we did we would have a city and nation that would @DATE1 slowly.   Any givein word can offend any certain person. The people that they offend are in my oppioen are the dead weights of our country that are just holding us back from fully ecpressing our self, the colorfull words that we @MONTH1 use can be offensive to one persson yet perfeectly fine to another. It all depends on the indivadual that likes or dislikes the word or readings. In my observations of people reading and dislikeing it because of it harsh and colorfull words is most offen people that do not fully express them selvs and our yet much more senitive. I think this also goes agenst freedom of speech. We were gaven that right so why wouldent we use it? Why wouldent people want us to express ourselvs? I have no idea why any person would want to take books,music,movies and magazines away from us. If every thing went by one mans rule of what to and not to read we would down grade as a country and @DATE1. Therefore i strongly advise not to take any books off the selves. The majordy of the people agree with me to not be censored and only the sensitive people that they offened will just make there own chiose not to pick the book off the selves,not to listen to music, And pick up the magazine. the right is ours and thats how is should stay	3	3	3
3213	2	I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves. No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them. Some people @MONTH1 think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed twards them. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine.     Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from. Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say.     Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they @MONTH1 never find it.       Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because thats @PERSON2's favorite color. Its not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested.      You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things. It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life. So why not take the risk? It could even help you.	4	3	4
3217	2	Whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library. The critialzing of books and materials that are neatly stacked in the shelves, are taken and miss treated from the harsh people that think they are offensive. In my point of view, I strongly agree that there is no right to argue about what should or should not be removed in the libraries.      The reflecting of my own views along with the libraries, shows intertest in the materials for people all over the world. The reason that I, myself, do not believe in this situation is how it mentioned in Katherine Paterson's passage. It explained, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 everybody around has a unique part about themselves, and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have. This leads into taking a material or book they see, the wrong way and being offensive about it. However, there might be someone else that does not view that same exact book is wrong, but instead, see's something else that could lead to be offensive to them as well.      To make this observation not as confusing, I will share my own experience that might help focuse more on my argument. There is a time when I went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout, that had an impact on colored people. It described how it would be like, if there was still slavery and that if everybody wasn't taught or treated equal amongst everyone else. In this situation, it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this. Maybe the people are relieved and interested, knowing they are free now. On the other hand however, many colored people might get in an awkward position, having no passion of bringing the equiality up in the present world, or even the future. Many might want to forget about what happened, instead of books and magazines still publishing articles and stories about it. Again, this argument might go both ways, meaning one less book would be off the shelf, or many would be newly stacked aside from the others.     When people think of materials, they most likly think of something that symbolizes an event, time period, or a symbol itself. This could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries. The way people want to take roll in the things they are part of, might actually be found in the library. However, someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown, will remove the material. This tends to make the people that thought it was right, not find the interest they wanted to recieve.     Another arugment people might have is that libraries are a public place, right? Well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings, materials, and movies. People might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out. Not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well. Well, instead of picking and choosing, I think everything should be left alone and people should only go to the section of interest they are looking for and leave the other materials out of their view.     My experience and observations about this argument has covered why I, and all of you, should reflect on the views of censorship the approperiate way in libraries. Not saying this will control all the problems, but it will help from removing all of materials that could have a big roll in future process of taching children, teachers, and of course, each and everyone	4	4	4
3218	2	I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because, what @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history.          What @MONTH1 be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa. If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that @MONTH1 be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left.          A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all. Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring.            People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself. A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members? this is why I believc we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc. off of the shelves	3	3	3
3220	2	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our chilren or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf.'( Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. That should be the right way, but I don't agree. I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They don't have to take the book.     I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Likeing a book is an opinion. For exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away  because that is just that one persons opinion. That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone likes something different so their should be different books.      When you don't like a book I beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay. You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community.     I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea. '@PERSON2' was one of the top picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. I t's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@PERSON2 @PERSON2'.     Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. What If someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf	3	4	3
3227	2	Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. Library now days have alot of offensive language in there books so if someone were to take all of the book like that out of the library then library wouldn't even have that many books in it. Music is the same way all music now days might have some offensve words in them thats just something people now days have to get over.          I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parent might not like the idea of there librarys haveing offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If the parent don't want there children to not read those book then they need to chose there childrens book, but I think takeing all the offensive book of the shelves isn't very smart. Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.           Some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in then like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road. So if you take those books off the shelves and werent able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things. They really wouldnt know the side effects and bad thing that could come out of those things. Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in then and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice word in them.I know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.     If there are book you dont want youself to read then don't read them. I think it would be unfair to take everthing that have some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read. Its not fair to people who @MONTH1 enjoy those books to not have the luxary to read those book anymore cause a few parent got mad about a book. Some of the old books have alot of racism in them, and you actually @MONTH1 read some of them in a school for a class. Those book @MONTH1 also have bad language in them to. Take thing those books away from us @MONTH1 take away are education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should.          So i think that censorshipn in library is just a horrible idea. It can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life	3	4	3
3229	2	Have you ever been looking for a book only to find it band from all local stores? Well I haven't had the misfortune of being in that situation, but I could only imagine the sheer distress of wanting but not finding that controversial book. I personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to. The fact that a book is found offensive of offputing to most is no reason to completely ban the book from store and library shelves alike, because if there is @CAPS5 one person that could educationaly benefit from reading this book then they should at least have a chance to obtain that information.      One of the most impotant things to remember while considering this topic is that no matter what the source is or what it conveys there will always be someone that feels the book is just to graphic of hits to close to home for them to stand. In other cases however, there are books that are not proper for younger children or the faint of heart, such as the book series 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which people are thrown into an arena and forced to fight each other for their very lives. Most people who are above the age of twelve can handle almost all of the 'offensive sources' that are atainable by the public, but there are some cases that @CAPS5 adults cannot handle such as the famous  book that @PERSON1 wrote in incarseration called ' @CAPS3 @CAPS4.' @CAPS5 in those extreme cases most adults can the read.      Now that my argument has been said and you know my point of view is that it veries from person to person whether they can handle a book I ask you if feel the same way that I do. My main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book. We do live in @LOCATION1 the land of the free, I think we can a little controversy over a book or magazine. I do hope that in the future we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over reaction to something offensive. I believe that we will see a day that no book will be band from the shelves, so that our children @MONTH1 gain the knoledge that is contained by thoes fragile pages of paper	4	4	4
3237	2	No I do not belive that certain materials should be removed. I belive that people should be able to have freedom of speech. I also belive that if somebody has something on their mind they should should be able to say it. I all ways tell peolple to mean what you say and say whay you mean. Now if its younger kids getting ahold of magazines and movies with inpropriate material in it then yes it should be censored or they shouldn't be placed in places with younger kids can get to them	2	2	2
3250	2	Some books in libraries offended some people. But other people want to read this book. None persone have right to say this book offended me so should the libraries removed it. If some book offend soome person that dosn't me all the people will offend by this book.My opinion is they should not removed this book, because some people like to read that book. If some one don't like this book and this book offended them.They shold don't read this book and read what they like. but son't say should be removed this book. I think evey one like different books. So should the libraries but every thing the people like read it..	2	2	2
3267	2	In my opinion, they should not censor books. They should be read the way that the author intended for @CAPS4 to be read. I understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they @MONTH1 be played on the radio and in the theaters.      The books that are contraversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them. They were written with this language because @CAPS4's the way people talked back then. These books are classics and should not be changed, or removed from the shelves.     In the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers. @CAPS4 should not be changed     @CAPS4 is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio. When an artist writes a song, they know that @CAPS4 won't be able to be played on the radio if @CAPS4 has bad or graphic language. I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so @CAPS4 can be played on the radio for all to hear.     The song '@CAPS5 You' by @ORGANIZATION1, they replaced the @CAPS6 word with '@CAPS5'. When he wrote this song, he knew that @CAPS4 wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and @CAPS4 is still a good song.     Movies are about the same as songs, they can't show a movie in theaters if @CAPS4 is too graphic. They @MONTH1 take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie. Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once @CAPS4 is sold in stores.     I undertand and respect everyones opinion on this matter, I am just voicing mine. If these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made @CAPS4 so.	3	3	3
3284	2	Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word? Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears? No matter how hard you try, you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society.      Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book? Many books in today's libraries have offensive language. Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, but in other cases the reader @MONTH1 be offended.     In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, put it back on the shelf. The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it. Some material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for younger readers. The maturaty level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship.     For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The @CAPS1' for its use of alcohol and drugs. Many people find this movie funny and entertaining. Should this movie be taken of the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs?      These words and actions we try to censor are not going away. We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you @MONTH1 be. So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one	4	3	4
3287	2	Censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. In the kids section, they have kid's books. In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @MONTH1 be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@CAPS5' or '@ORGANIZATION1' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience.      That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated @CAPS4 but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out. Just make a new section for it.	3	3	3
3302	2	I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary. Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color?     In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion.     In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let  your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet.      Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries.     Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary.     I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child	4	4	4
3307	2	Durning school one day all of our teachers told the class that most of the books in the libary is going to be took off the shelves. But our class don't want that to happen. All the teachers told us that some people parents has been complaning about what there kids are reading. I thank that most the the books that are in the libary is good for the kids to look at because thats what they like annd they like to learn about what would like to have or do someday. I also thank that it is a good thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life. Later in life when I have kids I would like them to dream about what they want to do in there life. So if that means that they want to go to school and look at magazines all day and make sure that thats what he wants to do thats fine with me.     So if the teachers want the books off the shelves they can but I don't think that the kids are going to try much if they cant be what they want to be later in there life time. I know that if they did that to my kids that I know I would buy them all the magazines thay want so they can learn what they want to do in life. So if they take all the books off the shelves I know that all the kids parents are probley going to get mad because thats what messes up the kids dreams.     Know when the kids what to read the schools is taking all the good books off the shelves none of the kids are going to know what they want to do in there later life. A good thing to do is to let the studends vote and see what the what to do about taking the books off the shelves. I bet most of the students in this world would say to keep them on the shelves because they like to read and look at pictures. That means that they want to be something when they grow up. I hope that my kid whats to be something that he likes to do when he grows up. I will help any kid as much as I can with there dreams.     There is two things that are going to happen. One is that the school is going to take the books off the shelves and the students are not doing to try in school and they might not know what they want to be. Or they might just give up on it all. And I know that know one whats that to happen. The second thing is that the schools is going to keep the books on the shelves and the students are going to want to read them more. Also they will probley know want whey want to do later in there life time. If I could pick what to do I would keep the books on the shelves and make the kid happy	3	3	3
3317	2	Have you ever got or check out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? I haven't but I checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex. Im not racist but some people are very racist. Some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them.     In libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. Which could be very bad if you think about it. He could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. Which i don't get because we are all the same to me.      In some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. Which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. Well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let me kid read a book like that.      Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kind of music. Some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. Well rap music is based on their past and how their life is. It does have some racism in it like certian rappers say bad words that aren't really sutible for young viewers.      Although some of the racism and cencorship that should be cencored are on shelves, I think it should be in a separete room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. I believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past	3	3	3
3319	2	Censorships in the libraris  would be liked cutting the worlds air supply. It would be taking away from a readers imagintion. stoping readers from being able to express their mind.      My veiw on censorship in the libraries would not be needed. Libraries around the world do good jobs keeping certain books in the apperpate ages levels. By removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed. Then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone. Then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries.      Books were made to keeping people wondering, learning, and excited. By cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds. More you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher. Then there would be no more author and more actors and actress. People minds would not be wondering, learning or being kept excited.      I remember when i was a little girl i went to the library. I was in the library looking for a book. I wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out. The library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back. Then i was able to check a book out.      So all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries. That would be tking away from a librarains job. So dont take away readrs imagintion	3	3	3
3321	2	Censorship, thats a word that causes alot of arguements in today's society. People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world. In some countries dictators do @CAPS4 allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases @CAPS4 even watch television at all. The majority of the time they do this because they do @CAPS4 want the citiznes of their country to know what is happening around the world. This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country but the people actually in the country have no idea whats going on around them.     Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense it is still plays a large part in today's society. Everything from music on the radio to military files are censored. Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact? Arguements over censorships have gone back and forth for years without really making much prgress at all. Each side of the arguement whether its for or against censorship is almost entirely opinionative. No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or @CAPS4. It's just to hard to determine who's opinion is really, more convincing.     In my opinion I dont think anything should be consored, if the writer of a @CAPS1 show throws in a vulger word most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion. The samething goes for songs, when an artist writes the lyrics to a song they are trying to convey a message and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically. Parents argue that their children are seeing to much violence on @CAPS1 and are causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suiting for children. There is an alternative to censoring all of these things, rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun just dont let your kids watch that show.      In the @LOCATION1 today we have something called freedom, we exercise this right everyday with what we wear, and what we say. I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on @CAPS1 you can make a decision simply to @CAPS4 watch that kind of show. Everyone has the option to say NO; if you dont want to hear or see something simply choose something else to watch, or even just do someting entirely different. You DO @CAPS4 have to do anything that you don't want to do. It's is an easy solution, all you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born an just say no, I dont want to do that. It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or @CAPS4 things need to be consored.	4	4	4
3328	2	In my opinion I think that censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries.I think that people are smart enough to make their  decisions on what they want to read. Their are a few reasons why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries or out in public. The first reason why i think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is becuase it's showing disobedience. The second reason I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because many people will overuse their authority, and it'll make many people have a bad review for that library. The last reason why I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that it'll change the whole enviroment of a library.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience. I think that many people will use profanity and will have an I don't care attitude. If people use profanity at home im a strong beleaver on leaving it at home and not bringing it out in public. Censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because many people will overuse their authority and most people wouldn't want to come back to the library. Some people overuse their authority by being loud in the libraries preventing others from reading or during something to occpy themselves. If a library is loud and obnoxious it'll drive people away from the library. I think that a library should be a nice quiet welcoming. That'll make the library much flow by easier.     At the of the day i think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public. A library is a place to go read, study, complete homework assignments etc. And finally i think that people should be able to make decisions on their own rather they want to read a book with censorship or anything to do with censorship as long as they can controll it	3	4	3
3364	2	Censorship is important. Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves?     I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world	4	4	4
3375	2	I think libraries shouldn't removed material from the shelves even thoug its offensive. The libraries should't removed offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic. For an example the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2. In some books its has some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that were stated by @CAPS4. Some @CAPS2 might take that offensive but other people from diffrent race or relegion might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesne't mean all of them are going to agree with it. People might have their own point of view, no one has there right of telling one person what they can or can't like.      If cenorship starts to occur in libraries or other in other communtiy places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offensded of their material. They might think that they are being told of what they can or can't read,listen,or believe in.That will occur a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simplier if library haves the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended of what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended of what one person says but who cares, not everyone is going to think or agree of what is being said. Its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves  and in your believes. Not everyone is right and perfect just be youselves	3	3	3
3378	2	People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries. They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why.     I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen. let them do what they want to	3	3	3
3379	2	Dear @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @MONTH1 concerm;             I'm writing you to explain that @MONTH1 students are tired of students in their school not returning books to their schoollibrary. Many students have report due on a book that a fellow classmate didn't return. Many students either forget they have a book out or even past due. So it makes it hard upon the student who is trying to do a report. If the books, music, magazines and etc., are not return people should have to be punished more than just having to pay a overdue fee.     I have witnesses alot of students who didn't either want to turn in the book thr checked out. We the junior class at my high school had a term paper that we need books, newspaper, internet and magazines. Lucky, The senior class turned in all of their book, newspaper, internet, magazines and etc., that they used on their term papers, we the junior class were able to sucess on our term paper. But many juniors still havent reutrn the materials they have used.The teachers have threqten them with overdue fees and or have to pay for the losted material. I see that having to pay an overdue fee and or have to pay for the losted materials doesn't bother them.      Even though teachers makes them pay the future classes will have to struggle and go out and purchase books, magazines, and etc., The classes that have to take @CAPS4 @NUM1 next year and do their term paper @MONTH1 not be able to sucess. It is unfair they have to worry will have the materials they need for them to sucess and do their term paper.      I think if the schools took time out and got parnets involed. They would n't have as many students would didn't follow rules. students think that their teachers can't tell them what to so maybe if their parnets were involes they would follow directions and turn in their books, magazines and etc.,     In conclusion, If someone wants to take a book they should get alot of their personal infornmation as well as their school name.If people dont return their books their want be any thing left for other people to use.So i say everybody do have the right to use the books, music, movies magazine and etc. to their adventage. Just try to remember to return them for other students as well.	1	2	1
3381	2	I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves.     I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance.      I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point. Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up. Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out.      Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others.     In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves	3	4	3
3387	2	Any one has the right to anything. Right to speak freely; to watch what they please; and so on. The censorship on the media depends. People who like that sort of thing can go to a place where they can buy censorship and un censoredship items. Every place these days has censored books, cd's, video games, ect. But then they also have uncensored items. For those parents or people who disagree with what is shown on the shelf.      Also on @CAPS1 parents complain about whats on @CAPS1, well there is a channel button and you can change the channel. Or even in todays technology you can block that channel from ever being watched.     No body ever said that they had to buy what the person in front of you is buying. People have the right to chose what they want to buy, wheather its censored or not. Say or do as they please as long as it's with in the rights of laws.     Its all about your style and what you let your child see. @CAPS3, @CAPS3. Its not as easy to keep children from the volgure things in the new technology. They go to a friends house and that childs parents don't care and let there child watch anything from @CAPS4-@CAPS5 rated. The most you let your child watch is @NUM1.     Its hard to keep a child sheltered from what you'd perfer them not to see. But what people have to realise is that there going to find out one way or another.      Also a child who is sheltered will go to the extremes to find out whats on the other side of the railroad tracks to get a taste of the water, to see what they have been missing out on.     Childeren will be childeren and they will sneak behind your back and do what they want to because they never knew what it was like in the first place.     Any one has the right to anything, you as a person chose not to allow your child you have a @NUM2 year old rated game, but his @NUM3 year old friend does have it. Remeber hes going to play it at his friends house.      Everybody has a different taste on censoreship. Some think everything should be a little cleaner others think different. So thanks to both sides, stores sell to you what you perfer.	3	3	3
3391	2	'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magizine's and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelfing units?     Magazine's are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are @DATE1 of age. Library's will most often place the magazine's on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers. Most of  the content of the magazine's are pictures of half dressed women or men and explict lanuage on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so.     I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better @DATE1 sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing @CAPS2.V. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems ardous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the magestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn'@CAPS2 right. It shouldn'@CAPS2 even be allowed.     With electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 know half the songs that the children buy, expecially when they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 buy it at home. With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive lanuage or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can'@CAPS2. And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the avaliablity of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the aweful lanuage all together in songs. Because the lanuage that they use is not needed.     Although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul lanuage is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explict lanuage and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea. It might just start a revolution	4	4	4
3396	2	First of all, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazined, etc, should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive, thats question should not be ask ever in life.      Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1. or @CAPS2. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     In my conclusion, about this article. I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries	3	4	3
3405	2	We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inapropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, its all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The  books in libraries across the @LOCATION1 that have found and profane ideas in them, is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today.     In my personal experience with this, i have come across books that have had inapropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despiteful it was. I've always been raised in a @CAPS1 home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is un-called for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Rascism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books.     In @LOCATION2, of course we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe. I believe that we should keep the future of @LOCATION2 in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is.      In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in @LOCATION2 fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are.     Today, the world has turned to a disaster. The kids we saw @NUM1 years ago were on the right path. Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate. And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across @LOCATION2 has something to do with it all. It is now in the hands of the @LOCATION3, whether our kids grow up to be the future of @LOCATION2, or the joke of @LOCATION2. We need this fixed	3	3	3
3427	2	Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves? No  we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves. Think of it in your own perspective. For example, say you like horror books. If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be.     I like @CAPS1 magazines. Magazines like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, or @ORGANIZATION1. If there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off. My perspective is that if you don't like what you see then put the book, magazine or whatever it might be up. Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you?     I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. At my school, we used to have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1. Just non-hurtful things. All it took though was one person to complain about it, and boom! They were gone. @CAPS1 fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone. So really, what is the problem?     The problem is that people can't handle what they see. It is understandable to a certain point. Like if your a very religous person, then yes i understand that you couldn't look at those things. But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful.     Finally, i just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something, doesnt mean someone else won't. You wouldnt want it to happen to you	4	4	4
3459	2	I do not believe that books should be censored. I believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up. The books at the library are on a shelf and little kids grab them everyday so why cant they read them if there in their sight. I've gone in libraries plenty of times and in all my experiences I have never come across an offensive book. If the books are offensive I believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see.     All the times I go to the Libraries I have never come across a book that was offensive. I think that if they allow some commericials to be put on television then why can't some books be put on display.I believe that reading sharpens the mind and if a kid picks up an adult but who are we to say no you can not read that. The Libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book you would not pick it up in the first place. If your child picks up a book that you dont want them to read then you should not have taken him in the store in the first place.          If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store. The libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music. If you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online. There is no reason why you shopuld have any compliants to a library the library is a place to help you. It is no mandatory to go to one if you do not like what they have then do not to the library.     Those are some valid points on why I believe that books, magazines, movies, and etc. should not be censored. If you dont like the movies they have don't go to the library. If you think their magazines are inapproapriate then order magazines online. If you don't like there books then order online or go to a book store. That is why I believe books should not be censored.	3	3	3
3463	2	I think they should'nt remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People find different things offensive that others do not. If you started takeing these things out,thers a good possibility that you'll loose everything,books and your people.      One example I say this is because, some people are offensive bout movies that have violent scense in them. Others like the violence in those shows. The librarie might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like.      Another example is, magazines can contain material you don't want your kids round or seeing. That same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school. Kids might need the material that is offensive,it could help them through life.       In conclusion I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offnesive. Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education. Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will.	3	3	3
3489	2	Do you believe everyone should have their on beliefs? Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture, or have their own opinions? Where's that one place where you can experience all of those? In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library you have the right to have an open mind.     I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries.      If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguements. Everyone could express themselves everyday, in their own way	3	3	3
3497	2	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 does that mean well I guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it. Maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf. I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books. If @CAPS3 based on a true story and @CAPS3 offensive it should be heard anywise because @CAPS3 part of history. Everyone needs to hear it because @CAPS3 true. If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language. For movies children should only whach @CAPS2 rated movies and nothing else. For magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language. But I could read any book I wanted to. It was in a book @CAPS3 not like I could onder stand @CAPS1 that bad ward ment.I think @PERSON1 saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights. And then she states that their wont be any books left for us. I think that means every book is bad if shes saying @CAPS1 i think shes saying.Their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  on the shelfs. Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children. And no @CAPS1 their reading. To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs.	3	3	3
3521	2	If materials are offensive they should not be displayed. Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age. I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive, then they should be removed.     Materials at libraries are not for everyone. A lot of it is especially not for young children. For example: @CAPS1 could be a young child wanting to check-out a movie that looks interesting  to him/her. The movie could be rated @NUM1 but the parents still check it out for them. Once they watch the movie, it @MONTH1 have some heavy language, sex-related humor or content. Then the child is learning and seeing all of this hapening in a motion picture. Also if they have nervous parents, the library could get some calls. Today, a lot of younger children about @NUM2+ have seen, watched, or read something that had profanity in it or inapropriate conduct in it.     People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in @CAPS1. If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines, it would absolutely bother them. If they won't take them off of the shelves, the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence in them. They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material.     With all of the nasty things that are seen in books, movies, magazines, etc., people need to be alerted to what they read and watch. Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say. Library materials must be checked. If they are found offensive, and proved offensive, they should be moved.	4	4	4
3530	2	Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. Should censorship be allowed in libraries? Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I believe it should be allowed.     Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. Young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see. Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children. Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child @MONTH1 take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting.      I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. Children that are under the age of @NUM1 should not be watching movies that are rated @CAPS1-@NUM1. There is a reason the rating is what it is. Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material @MONTH1 be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. If it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your @NUM3 year old coming home cursing and fighting. My sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library.          Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. Maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials. Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library	4	4	4
3533	2	Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to public be removed? No,  I strongly disagree.           Should books that @MONTH1 be offensive to others no because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more. All books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them. For example say there is a book about abortions and you want to know more about this subject so you deside to check it out. In the line behind you is a women who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason. No this would not happen just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys.     Here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves like sex. Things such as sex @MONTH1 offend people because you @MONTH1 beileve it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids but thats not the case. Most books on sex teaches you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay self. People need to understand that @PERCENT1 of teens world wide are sexually active and books that @MONTH1 help you to protect yourself and others.      In conclusion there are many people that @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion. You cant take things away just because of one person that would not be far to a individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on there personal problem. For these reasons I disagree with taking away items that @MONTH1 be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has on you.	4	3	4
3536	2	Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries? No, I think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it. They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them. If the person complains about a book, music,movies or anything then they  should not go to the library. I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain, they shouldn't be aloud in the library.     When I was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library. I thought it was fun because it looked awsome inside. I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal. When I was looking, I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians. He was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves. He was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave. I read the book and I thought there was nothing offeensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually they got free.        My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People that do not think they are offensive will read them. If a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book. That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries.	3	3	3
3538	2	Censorship               Censorship is it needed in todays societey? Where things that were considerd bad @NUM1 even @NUM2 years ago are ok today to be veiwed read listened to and so on. Is it a  needed process or should libraries have free will to stock there shelves with what ever they seem fit to be there.Is it still a good process to use or is it a outdated uneeded resource that is now no longer needed.          Everybody in todays soicitey says to read, but libraries @MONTH1 not have the type of litature that your are in to, so why would you want to read somthing that you do not like because the library dos not have the book that you wanted to to see i.       I believe that censorshop in libraries should be their  to remove any book the find offenseive or immoral from there libary. I do not belive they should remove books becasue of  bad language, or somthing about god.        I think that books or magazines or movies with '@CAPS1' content should be removed from libraries if they see it fit. Libraries should only feature books tht they want to have not ones that are popular but considerd 'bad' by the library. They should only have books they want to have.       I do believe that their should be censorship in libarys. I just do not belive that it should be a harsh system. I think that they should set standards on what they want to have and following those standards on books they buy.               I do think however that some libraries will set their standards to low or high that they wille ether have many books that are considerd 'bad', or no books at all. It is a very fine line when it comes to materials that the library has to be considerd good or bad. I think libraies should havea  set of standards nation wide to set what type of material is good for libraries.          I believe that censorship is still a needed, and helpful process. I just think that it is to much of a opionated process. not enough facts or opions of the poeple. I think that is should remain in use for society i just belived it should be more under control then it is today.	3	2	3
3586	2	Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve?                                            What if @NUM1 people came into a library with  @NUM2 books, magazines, music and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like.                                                                 If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing?                The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse.              I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it. One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have  separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges.                                       If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy.	3	3	3
3587	2	Yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of ANY human etc. but the music part is up in the air because like kids hearing songs with cussing talking about drugs and all that other bad stuff shouldnt because like the way i see it everybodys gonna learn about it somehow and when you hear songs for multiple songs you tend to begin to know the wordsd and if you repeat the words in front of a parent thats when they can step into the aprent roll and tell them that the drugs and words are nto good. Really though if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says then i feel like they should know right from wrong by then and clearly if someone is using bad language such as the @CAPS1 word they would know that its wrong and if they continue to listen to it thats on them.	3	3	3
3589	2	Censorship is a growing problem is today's world of literature.  Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to.  Katherine Paterson says that if were all aloud to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about.  Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society.     In the novel '@CAPS1 @NUM1' censorship is one of the main themes of the story.  Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions.  @PERSON3 finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them.  The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society.  When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy.  @PERSON3 decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how. The brain is a muscle, if it is not excercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless.  So when he tries to memorize a part of the @CAPS2, he cannot retain what he has been reading.  Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn.     The members of this novels society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world.  What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day.  In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved.  In a normal society, learning leads to questioning.  But for them there is no learning, just accepting.  And acceptance leads to contentness, which in the end leads to unhappiness.     The society in '@CAPS1 @NUM1' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways.  To them, death is not a big deal.  @PERSON2 was killed by a speeding car, and @PERSON4, @CAPS4 wife, was not even shocked to hear it.  Another example is when @PERSON3 was running from the police, and a car full of rambunxious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to.  At the end of the novel, @PERSON3 is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes.  The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday!  A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed.      Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer.  Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about.  Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenagers mind atleast once.  But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well.	4	4	4
3593	2	Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some? Why is it offensive and how is it offensive? What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and movies that are offensive to some of the people?     In my opinion there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons. Some reasons @MONTH1 include: the put down on races, comments in the book, how the author wrote it and who it was written towards.      Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use. Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personal.      Music can be offensive to some people becasue of the language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children @MONTH1 listen to it, and children nowadays say things they here from music and try to be like the person saying it.     Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated. A good movie would be @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today.      Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting ahold of things like that.      Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library. So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are ofensive to some people. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So therefore it's  not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it.	4	4	4
3596	2	Should They or Should They @CAPS1?     What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about there apperence or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should @CAPS1 be hearing this or haveing to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion i do @CAPS1 think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them @CAPS1 to be like that?     One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though alot of kids have to listen to there parents fight and yell. So, why dont they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to?     There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelvs. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if  I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That get me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your childern get it. As being a teegager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldnt be listening to, but even if my daughter was @NUM1 there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what there child gets just because they don't care, well thats @CAPS1 your problem.      There should,however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or @CAPS1. Books with sex scenes and murder should @CAPS1 be allowed into they @NUM2 year old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldnt be allowed to read something that adults do. Most @NUM1 year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen prganacy. As much as they should get information on it, have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and alot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they have'nt done anything so far is beacuse @CAPS1 enought parents care.This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing.     This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why arn't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or @CAPS1. Last but @CAPS1 least try to talk your libraien into makeing groups of books. Some for the youngre kids some for the older. Woulnt kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and @CAPS1 just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and @CAPS1 let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!!Make a say!!	4	4	4
3597	2	Some people think that offensive books should be off the selves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed.     I do not believe that certain materials (books, movies, and magazines.  If we take evey book off the self then we would not have any book to read.  If we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking @NUM1 books off the self.  Then with in two days there would be not books left.     If we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad. We should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read.  If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books.     This is why people should not take offensice books off the selves. This will make peoples eyes so bad that they would not see good at all.	2	3	2
3624	2	A kid walks into the library up town. He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch. He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanidity. Who is to blame? The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out?     Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play.     But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatning. Libraries have movies that are rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. They @MONTH1 also have music that has explicit lyrics on the @CAPS5. Some libraries @MONTH1 not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others.     In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and @CAPS4 movies, they should possibly be fired. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages.     In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents. Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements.	4	4	4
3625	2	Censorship at  the library is not needed at all times. It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certin cases when it's needed though.     It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids. they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them.     The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it.     Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not rignt. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be down right mean some times. The whole world is just corupted.     There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature. People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read. The library shouldn't censor their books.	3	3	3
3638	2	Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go. No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.      First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different intrests than others. Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem.      I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library.      All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive	4	3	4
3643	2	When u go places there will alway be something that one won't like not everyone likes everything. A library has to be the worst place for people not liking things. Censorship in libraies is getting worse and worse everyday, it is in everything in books, movies, music, and magazines. Should we keep things like this on shelfs? Everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries.     On the shelfs is lots of things with bad laugauge naughty pictures. These books little kids can pull off a shelf and see things that there parents dont want them to see. Censorship is everywhere not just in libraries. The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad. If there is a need for things like this Then have a special store for things like this	2	2	2
3644	2	Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools. There @MONTH1 be  a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library. A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, because they are either too violent, or they have bad language in them. If kids or parents are offended by these types of books, then they do not need to check them out. There should not be censorship on books in schools.          There have been a lot of books, teachers view as being educational books, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries. Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read. There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word, or a few violent scenes for them to read. Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone, and touch them. Banning books in libraries needs to change.          People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are books that are very good that have been banned. '@CAPS1 for @PERSON1' for example was banned in public schools for some reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age.      Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good. Many peoples lives could be changed, touched, moved, etc... due to a book. Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life. People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it.	4	4	4
3652	2	So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks @CAPS4. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, @CAPS4's about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf.     I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, @CAPS4's @CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave.      What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 off line. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library?      But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs. Say you gotta @NUM2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? I mean in sounds corny but @CAPS4 can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a @CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where @CAPS4 goes bad.      After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to @CAPS2 they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But @CAPS4's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's @CAPS2 a library has many, many choices when @CAPS4 comes to books.      That's when the question comes up, '@CAPS2 don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' @CAPS3, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for @CAPS4? Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms.     @CAPS4 sounds crazy, but @CAPS4 wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for @CAPS4, check @CAPS4 out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. @CAPS4 sounds easier that looking @CAPS4 up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number.      All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause @CAPS4 @MONTH1 be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, '@CAPS4's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.	4	4	4
3653	2	Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book. @CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another	4	4	4
3655	2	This essay is all about wether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some.     I do not believe things should  be removed from shelves in libraries if they offened someone. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all . If you are offeneded by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it , ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need , or try to search what your looking for on the internet.     When i visit the library I already know what im going to get so i have never found anything offensive to me. If I did find something offensive to me I would complain and if they didnt do anything about it I would just never go back. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs.      The libraries I go to always have sections seperating the different age groups. The sections are split into children , teens , and adults . I' ve been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. If the library had something that would offense me I wouldn't know. Everytime I go I stay in one paticular section for teens and look at magazines and books .      I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't	3	3	3
3661	2	Censorship; the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye. Is this the right thing to do? Should society as a whole take away variety? Do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have? I believe censorship is wrong in every aspect, but I also believe that materials that are offensive, or unappropiate for certain ages can be controlled.      Movie theatres, video stores, @ORGANIZATION1, and television all do it. They use ratings and age control for their viewers. Now control can be difficult, and @MONTH1 not always work if not handled correctly. To handle this situation before it arises, the library can use a system like restaraunts or bars use; such as, checking identification before letting a book that is '@CAPS1' rated or above be checked out. Different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups. Now you @MONTH1 be thinking; doesn't this idea take away from the liberties that libraries give us? Well you @MONTH1 be right, but you would rather have our children see violence and other inappropiate materials that they shouldn't? It would be just like the movie theatre. You would not need to buy a ticket, but the control of content would be phenomial compared to what it is. Would you want your six year old girl picking up an adult violence movie, sexual content movies, or even a @CAPS2 with cursing in it? Why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon?      I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be something age appropiate. Our society is maturing too fast for young children, why should the library take part in that? Libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers' for their library are students. This being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material.      Yes, media is everywhere. Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, music, and much more flash and sell more than they should. Media shows children things they shouldn't know about until they are young adults, but does this make it okay? Does it make is right for children to see and want all they want to? No, it does not. Fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire. Why start our children out at a young age with violence, sex, and inappropiate material? Would you like to set your children up to fail? I know I wouldn't so why let our libraries hand out books, magazines, movies, and more to let our children thrive upon the culture they are stuck with? I do not think we should remove these books from our libraries because everyone has a different opinion, but I do believe that control needs to be put into place for our children's and other children's sacks. With that being said, censorship is overrated, but some of the material at the library are underrated, and that needs to be handled and controlled	4	4	4
3662	2	Everyone has a favorite book. And some of us can't put it down once we read the first sentence. Then days later, the library takes it down and states that it's offensive to many people that have read it. Why should multiple people lose a good read just because someone doesn't like what they see? We're all trying to accomadate to everyone and their needs just to please them. Whatever they ask is done because we don't want a big scene. A majority of people think, 'That book is offensive! Take it down! Disgusting!'. But why?     Everyone has a right to read what they want to read. No library should uphold to the needs of a minority about an 'offensive' book just because they say it's inappropriate. Who are we to judge what's good for everyone and what's not? Books are written for a reason, and that's to share the ideas of the author, not to corrupt society with their 'evil' and 'offensive' ideas that could potentially cause a child to rebel. That excuse is ridiculous. A parent should've taught their child to differentiate between right and wrong, and if they use the '@CAPS1 child will become a rebel if they read this!' excuse, then they're not confident in their childs capability, or the fact that they taught their child well.     Also, it's not just the readers getting angry, it's the author. How bad would someone feel if they spent a year or two on a fantastic book, just to have it banned from library after library? Probably angry or upset. Authors have the right to write whatever they want. If they wish to talk about dragons and princesses, so be it. If they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do? Go right ahead. No one can stop great books from being made and they certainly shouldn't be able to stop people from reading it. If someone is offended by a book, then don't read it, simple as that.     Parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of @LOCATION1. By having this desire, the parents do every little thing to make sure their son or daughter doesn't see, hear, or read anything inappropriate or 'bad'. This is just ridiculous. Controlling a childs life will just cause them to rebel more and more as they get older. Let children have a choice in what book they read, or the movie they watch. Parents need to teach their children right from wrong, and in doing so, letting them see, hear, or read whatever they want should be no problem.     Without books, movies, and music, what would the world be like today? No one knows. Books are a great source of information, letting the author express themself as well. Movies are almost just as harmless, limits are needed, but overall? There should be no problem. Also, music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion. Allowing that music, or movie, or book to be made, and then take it away is ridiculous. If it offends someone, then that person should just forget it, instead of taking it away from the people who love it and the person who made it.	4	4	4
3663	2	I dont think there should be any censorship good books and music shouldint be removed just becaus one person finds it offensive. Becaus the opinion's of one @MONTH1 be diffrent with another.I beleave music is cencord the most becaus  not many people get offendid by books but censorship in music i think is destroying it.Becaus its an artists way of expresion and if people dont wana listen to what there saying then they should just not listen to it.Books i think shouldint be taken offensivly forthe same reason music shouldint its a writers oppinion and expresion its like telling someone they cant voice there oppinion on anything like racesim or use curse words if they want.	2	2	2
3680	2	I will be talking about, do think books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people. Because not all people have the same interests.     First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves.     Another example can be a book. what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended. They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend.     The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertizement. A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person.     In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. they shouldn've look at the item in first place.	3	3	3
3695	2	When people  think of libraries  they picture  this cold place with and old mad lady telling you to be quiet.Or they just picture this books every where . But libraries today has be way more improved and advance with music,movies,and etc.     When i was  young I never really like libraries  because they seem boring to me.Thats why I wasn't good read either until I was in the six grade because I discover the library was actually cool place. They different thing to do like look up books,music,or movies  you can check out the libraries. Or sometimes you migth have magazines you can check out too.                                Then at the libraries there people who don't like it because of the music,movies,and etc.This reason is because use to it being quiet in libraries and not full with kids and teens.Thats why the faithful and ones go to the libraries everyday take the new things offense to the library.     When it all boil down this topic makes me think about To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it was offense book talking about the whites treated the negreos back then. The reason say that is because old tradition in the library are like the whites in the story and the  new things in library  are like the negreos who was outcasted by the whites.Then in book it took one little girl to settle diference and knows whats right and wrong.     Thats why I think instead of banning or remove stuff we should have disscusion.Which we can come to adgreement keep new ideas in the libraries.When do keep the ideas maybe we can make a section for thet new ideas so the people comes to library wouldn't get offend	3	3	3
3707	2	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes.  However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes.  @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.  We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.     If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.  If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.  Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.  Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.  After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.    Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.  We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.  We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.  People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.     Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.  Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson.  Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.  If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out.  Then, many words would be gone.     Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.  However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.  I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.  People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.  We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.  If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.  However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.                                                            Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2	5	5	5
3717	2	Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want. Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright. I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings.      Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive. well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''.  Am sorry but thats not how life works. If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way. If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves.     Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive. Heres what i say to it, get over it .          The other  day i was at the bait shop and i heared a word that  i dare not to even  say and i hate hearing that word. What was i going to do tell a grown man to not say that?...... I just  rolled my eyes and went on about my  buisness.          Should books, music, ect; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well like ive  been saying this whole time, in live there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you. You have to get over it . Sometimes geting over offensive things that you see are not easy but hey lifes not  easy	3	3	3
3723	2	Newspaper staff and/or whom it @MONTH1 concern,      Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover.      In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the selves of the world or nation's libraries. @CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries      Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientel. When a major divistion such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. @CAPS1 would ruin the economy. Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to.      People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intellegent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuede others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences.      Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. @CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated	5	5	5
3728	2	Society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not. We witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to. It is the classic argument between two parties trying to prove eachother wrong, what is admissable and what is not. We should try with all our efforts to keep inapporpriate books off of our shelves and out of the hands of the young population.     People can be influenced to do just about anything. There are too many of these tales to pick out even one. The interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly. Whether it be through television, music, or books, man can be molded into something through what they are conditioned to believe.      The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative. As a lowly person who only wants what is best for society, I know that movies with criminal acts or explicit images do not help anyone become a better citizen. It is no different with books. Books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal.     I am not in any way against reading books, rather I am quite on the contrary. Reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fast-paced world. But if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature, they should be removed for the good of the people around us. If one cannot find a book to read that is not deemed appropriate, then he or she needs to take a look at themselves. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well.     We as members of the @ORGANIZATION1 are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not. We do not need to add more to the table when we let the population gain access to obsene books that would typically make someone only rebellious to society. If something is making the people of our lands more riotous than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general. Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time!	4	4	4
3739	2	Libraries in @LOCATION1     I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book. I dont think that just because it is offensive someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject.          I think if someone dose'nt like whats in the book they should just not read it or something, because some people might find it interesting. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. Thats why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. Thats what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf.     So whoever is reading this please take this in consideriation and relize that some people like different books than others. So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. So thats all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because there offensive to them	2	3	2
3740	2	In Libraries there are many books, magazines, music, or movies that @MONTH1 be found offensive to many, but it might be what some people like to read; therefore we must keep all of the materials no matter how crude. These library materials are all part of the worlds past and all have a bigger story behind it which has an even bigger story behind it and so on. If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of. The world will be less intellegent and we start to forget and lose our past. This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magizines off the shelves of a library for it @MONTH1 be special to someone or @MONTH1 be crude to others but it in the end they all contain some past that no other book @MONTH1 contain.      A world with no so called innapropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place but it will be stripping people of knowledge that @MONTH1 be needed. If everyone took a book off the shelve than none would be left. The books would start to lose their love, compasssion, and livlyhood within them. Other books @MONTH1 contain segregation and segregation is a big part of americas past. The word negroe is offensive for some and if we took all of the books with the word negroe out than we would lose @NUM1 years of americas past that cannot be forgotten. Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, rising and fallsing of many empires and kingdoms would all be gone because the violance was to offensive. Many historic moments in the world's history woul.d be lost forever. We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the world's past.     The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books. If the books were put in there own section in the library than kids would not be able to see them causing this to be no  problem for young eyes to see. If you find many books offensive than you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them. If we start deshelving books than soon movies will be going and than magazines will be limited to only say so much. I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not  have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to throw away offensive books than we should just have a section where offensive books should be and kids cannot get to. In @CAPS1 this is how we could censor books in libraries.      Books, Movies, Magazines, and music are a part of every country in the world today. It is was changes countries and makes them different, it gives them there own culture which we can share with each other. So no matter what we should should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries. Censorship @MONTH1 be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again. All in all we cannot get extinguish the flames of our past or we @MONTH1 never have a future	4	4	4
3749	2	If i had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library i wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it because everybody as a right to read, lisen and see whatever they want. If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else why would they be seeing it in the first place. Some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books beacuse it would affect their children.Their would be a change in kids education.     Everybody has the right to read whatever they want. Their are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things. If books would have to be remove from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out. One way or another evrybody ends up reading all those offensive books at a certain point of their lifes anyways.     The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibid them from doing it. In my opinion I think that if parents took the time to explains their kids the good and bad things about life it wouldn't be that offensive for their children.     Another reason of why i wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids. Removing books means taking away history from them. There are many painters in our history that painted naked womans many people find that offensive. I think they should never take that history from them beacuse they are just learning things about their history.     Books, music, magazines, ect should not be remove from libraries. Because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not. Removing this items would just be a total chaos. They should leave the libraries just the way they are. Everybody has the right to read, lisen and see whatever they want.	3	3	3
3755	2	Imagine. A nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books. Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story. You not only read at home but at school as well. Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school? How unfair it would to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person. This i could not imagine.     At my school, teachers and other faculty are always encouarging kids my age to read more often. Most teenagers are always busy participating in after school events such as: band, playing a sport, theater, choir, ect. Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when i heard about this strange news. Should books, magazines, ect., be removed from shelves if they are offensive? I do not think doing that would be a good decsion. Kids should be able to read what they want to read.     As you probably know, not all kids are alike. Some enjoy things that others @MONTH1 not. For example, not all kids like to eat corn. This goes with reading as well. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novel. Some novels, more than others have a lot more graphic content such as @CAPS1. @CAPS1 has a lot of fighing in it. If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all @CAPS1 movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries? Another example would be the @CAPS3 series. Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. Should we not be able to borrow or rent this movies? I do not think so.     Another reason I do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is, not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, @ORGANIZATION2. Personally in my family, me and my brother believed in @LOCATION1 for many years. My cousins however, do not teach their children about @ORGANIZATION2. If I brought over @ORGANIZATION1 and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of @ORGANIZATION1? The answer is no. Some families have a tradition. Just because one family does not want their kids to know about @ORGANIZATION2 does not mean that eveyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie about @ORGANIZATION2.     So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it offensive to them? I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. I do not think that offensive novels should be taken of the shelves because: kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book if offensive and lastly because if we got rid of all the offensive books; what books would be left to read	4	4	4
3757	2	I belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is. If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library.     I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them.       In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day.     What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything	3	3	3
3761	2	History is bond to repeat itself right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future @LOCATION2. By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up.      The effects of what @MONTH1 come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assinations, and religions protests of the past. The @ORGANIZATION1 prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read?      I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen year old girl in my class who got pregant. She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book. This book she read wasn't hers it was her mothers and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and @PERSON2 read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. @PERSON2 said the book explained what guys wanted. She did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library.     This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on; because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they @MONTH1 grab at the library. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too. But, my point is they should have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool.      By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make discissions that could effect the rest of their lives. Just like how @ORGANIZATION2 has a new song out. The lyrics are inapporiate of many young children, but you can look it up on youtube. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding. These songs show us why children are having children, or doing drugs. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them.      Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we @MONTH1 accomplish something no one else has. To show the world @LOCATION2's youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright. We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true.      If we have more students reading stuff such as, ' @LOCATION1, or To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true fiction or non-fiction. It doesn't aways matter as long as your reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully.      Many of the young women in my sophmore class have read, ' the @CAPS3 series,' and they loved it which made them read other vamiper books. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it. To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied. We have say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by elimating the ones we would choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines; about @PERSON1 who just drove around with her baby on her lap. What choice are you choosing for you life?     In my personal oppion I believe children and adults should have separate televisions shows, magazines, and books. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way. These are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen. To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word? I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life, or school. To go and learn what you already know	4	4	4
3763	2	Books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity. Taking certain books off the shelves @MONTH1 have a negative effect on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think. People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves. Using my own observations, reading, and my own experience I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves.     First, I watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves and maybe they aren't the best for them. I believe from watching them, that it helps them grow. Being a young kid you're curious and they need to be able to look at just about anything. Honestly, if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day. Personally I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again, and help them learn right from wrong.      Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have. I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing. I've read books about slavery, and war and it just wants me to make the world a better place. Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong.     Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves. Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone.We older, and more wiser adults need to realize that it's not all bad, yes bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else. A family member of mine is a photographer and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career. Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this.     All in all, I understand of removing some books, magazines, and movies but we can't. I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people. Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad. We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach, so that the books and movies aren't abused. Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves. Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them	4	4	4
3772	2	I belive that everyone has there own appioin on whats appropreate, and whats not. You can't @CAPS4 taske a couple people and ask there oppinon because everyone is differant, we all have our owne rights to know books and what the aurthor realy wanted us to learn or here about. Like i said everyone is differant if you @CAPS6't want your @CAPS1 to read it tell your @CAPS1 why and explain it to them. @CAPS6't make the rest of the @CAPS1 suffer.         I belive some parents need to look at our ansatre there wernt even aloud to have dreams and thoughts. Why would we want our @CAPS1 to go threw the same thing they had to, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 everyone shopuld have a right to look to read listen to what ever makes them happy, So what if i has volger launguage in it get over it or @CAPS6't listen to it all.            Would you want someone telling you that your life story for example was crummy and diddent like the way you worded things. Thats the way you talk it's because it's your life story. The way i see it is let our children of this generation learn all they can about the bad stuff so they can stay away from it and also infor them of the good stuff in life so there won't allways be in fear. Let the chinlden read what ever they want to read. So what they curse tell your @CAPS1 that its bad launguage. @CAPS6't get ride of good books movies music.(@CAPS3:) @CAPS4 because the Author has a diff veiw on life than yours. Open your @CAPS5, @CAPS6't be so shallow	3	3	3
3780	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, I do think that certain materials such as books. music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because, some students read book on a daily basics and reading also keep some students out of trouble. The @CAPS8 I say that is because if you find a book you might be interesting in the book and you might share @CAPS2 with you youger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things. Also some books that are offensive shows students to not do the things they see in the book. Some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes. Some books that are offensive show people what to do or what not to do so you wouldn' t have to pay that cost from doing something wrong.     Also music can be offensive because of the curseing that some of the songs have in @CAPS2.The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and takes action in a certain way.The offensive part about the music is that some music is calm music and @CAPS2 keeps you motivated inside and some music have bad vibes to @CAPS2 and can make you do bad things.Most of the time music can make you happy and you can undertsand alot in life just by listening to music. Music is a description of life meaning that life is ful of offensive things but you have to be very selfcentered to understand.     Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies. Movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way. At times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies. The titles in the movie can also be offensive but that don't mean the movie is a bad relation in the story.     Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine. Some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to. Also there are different things like activitys and things for family and freinds to enjoy. Many magazines are different in there own way @CAPS2 depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magzine. Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career.     There are alot of things that can be offensive in the world but you have to learn how to seperate yourself from the negative things in life. Also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we here in these days. The most important thing is that you don't have to listen what the magazines and movies are telling you because, you have a mind of your own. People don't listen to what the books and etc, are going by because some of the things they are talking about is false information. So thats why i say @CAPS7 i do believe that cartain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.                                                                 Sincerly,                                                            @ORGANIZATION1	4	4	4
3790	2	I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others. However, if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it.      So what i'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book  is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existant.      I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read. I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable.      The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be. So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem.	3	3	3
3796	2	Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world.  They contain many different styles and genres of books.  Some might not be appropriate for young children to read.  There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves.  I believe that no book should be denied of this right.  Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.     Most libraries have children sections.  Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section.  So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway.  Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.     Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child.  Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library.  If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.     Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like.  They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off.  If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves.  The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly.  People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not.  Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.      There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing.  Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen.  Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen.  Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read.  Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.	4	4	4
3815	2	In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines and much much more. Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages. I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read. It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads.     Let us start with books. There are many different types of books. From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires. How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though? The answer is simple. When you are younger, your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature, you begin to make thoses choices yourself. It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book.      Movies guidelines are along the same pattern. Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth. When you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, and look at the rating. If it seems to intimadating, or innapropiate, or violent, you make the choice to see it or not.      Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books. If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian. Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation. Some suggestions could be: to remove the item from the shelf, or to write and extra review on the book, or write to the author/movie director. The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone. If it offends you, just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out. Others @MONTH1 still enjoy the item even though you don't.          There are many books, movies, magazines, etc. out in the world. Some @MONTH1 be deemed as innapropiate or offensive. There are many other choices that are 'okay'. So if you don't approve of a certain book, just send it back to the library and find one you do like.	4	4	4
3861	2	Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason,what I like is my prefence.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has there own taste.     Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch. ect.. People have a prefence and they like to have it avaible when they want it. Libraries are great use for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen. And other people should not get offended by what other like.     Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that sections then you can ask for it to be removed to another section. But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it. How is that fare to others who might like it.     If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok' then it ok for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it. Someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has there own taste. Don't be offended by what others like.	3	3	3
3865	2	Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?	4	4	4
3877	2	Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies.  These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials.  What about the adults?  Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults.     Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them.  To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this.  Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it.  This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism.  If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them.     Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of.  Offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship.  Some adults like the original songs with the original words.  Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to.     Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over.  They are being rated @CAPS3, suitable for all ages, @NUM1, suitable for children @NUM2 and older, and rated @CAPS4, suitable for people @NUM3 and older.  These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie.  Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs.  If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @NUM1 or rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.     Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme.  If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.	4	4	4
3880	2	Dear Newspaper:              @CAPS1, there should be censorship in libraries, but people should be a certain age just to check the book out. Some people go to the libraries just for censorship.          These days censorship basicly is how you get children or students just to pick up a book. Plus, if the parents aloud their child to read cebsorship books because they think it does no harm to the child which it don't. Put a @NUM1 and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have @CAPS2 just to solve the age problem. However you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people.          I no you think censorship should be taking off every shelf in the libraries, but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that then the libraries will go out of business for good. That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on there selvies. I'm finish but I will leave you with this question: do you really want to take censorship out the libraries?	3	3	3
3904	2	Many people in the @LOCATION1 read. Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.      Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears.      If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon?      Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed.     For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction	4	4	4
3914	2	I don't think they should remove anything thats offensive from the library cause honestly, most of the books author publish have something offensive in @CAPS1. I'ts not the library's fault, if there's children reading these books that are offensive then that's the parents fault for letting them read them. I've been to the library and listened to music, watched movies, and even read magazines that have some offensive content in @CAPS1, but if they weer to remove all the offensive content from the library, then the library would be half empty.          I've seen parents discussing to the librarians about banning content thats not appropriate from the library, but why would @CAPS1 even matter if they can just ignore @CAPS1 and keep @CAPS1 away. @CAPS1 honestly isn't a big deal when @CAPS1 comes to these type of problems. I discussed this with my mom once and she completely agree's  with me. My mom said ' @CAPS1 would'nt be a problem as of today if they could of just ignored @CAPS1'. Also the music that they have should stay their wether or not its offensive cause people like to express themselves with the music that they listen to. The movies that are made these days all have innapropriate content in @CAPS1, wether its a rated @CAPS2 movie or not.          As of all the argument going on about library's having offensive content, @CAPS1 should still be kept at the library and not removed. I'm sure alot of teens and adults enjoy all the content that's kept at the library. If children end up listening to the offensive music, or watching offensive movies then think about @CAPS1 like this, they need to grow up someday. If that's not the case then parents should keep them away from the content	3	3	3
3954	2	I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries, @CAPS7 it's not fair to everybody. If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining. I have a few reasons also @CAPS6 I think there should not be censorship in libraries.     @CAPS5 first reason is freedom of the press. In our @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our rights. I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read.     Another reason I have would be freedom of speech. Also written in our @ORGANIZATION1 of @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that. If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us. We're slowly losing our @CAPS1 given rights, @CAPS7 people are offended by books and things of that nature.     A personal experience I have was one day @CAPS5 friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be over the @DATE1's and slavery. Unfortunately, @CAPS5 friend was @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment. When we got to the library, things got worse. All of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then.     @CAPS5 friend was getting very upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, '@CAPS4 you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, 'No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' @CAPS5 friend was dumbfounded. He couldn't believe what he had just heard.     After he had came back over to where I was sitting, I had told him that she was right. '@CAPS6's that?', he said. I said, '@CAPS7 if she would've taken all those books down, she would've had to take about every other book down too, @CAPS7 somebody would find something hurtful.' 'You know, your probably right,' he said.     Censorship isn't fair, @CAPS7 it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy. It's not fair to punish other people based on what they read, write, or say. We all have our own preferences; how would you like it if yours got taken away?	4	4	4
3957	2	As an individual and what books I have read, I believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf. My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. This also includes music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. The less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway.         We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. theres even songs about it, no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items we @MONTH1 see positive results.     Like I said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials. They will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they're older. In the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf.	2	2	2
3974	2	I do not think that censoship has a ightful place in our librares. I know that libraries were created to be information! hubs for the public. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they @MONTH1 be seen as offensive to a  minority of people................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................	2	2	2
3979	2	Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some book, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs, profanity, and unaproperit situations.     How many schools have books that have racism in it. Racism happens in books all the time. In fact one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2. It recently got banned from schools all over the @LOCATION1.     People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools. It is up to the kids not to read them.     Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books. Do you say to blame them?     I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for @CAPS1 youth.	3	3	3
3990	2	Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view?     For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages.     Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to.     Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you.     With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech.	4	4	4
4002	2	Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different than what you or anyone else like you @MONTH1 think some of the things are offensive, but yet again something you don't like someone else @MONTH1 like, and want to read. Would if be fare to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else dose not like, and thinks that it offens them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said.      I don't think that thinks like that should be taken off a shelf for something like, becasue there could be a person in school that needs soemthing like that is not right for a child to be looking at,but what if there is a kid in high school or collage that needs a book to do a project over that type of things, but also yes I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at or listening or reading something like should not be able to get a hold of because parents should not have to worry about them going to a librariy, and there children see something that they do not want them to see. There are vary many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is to little to see or hear what there parents do not want them too. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a sertent age to be able to go look or listen to them.      Lubraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds or books you should be machure for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it beacuse you see it just about every where you go now days. You really can not get away with out dealing with it	3	4	3
4007	2	Books now an days have action, romases, and, etc. So that's why the books that are not moving off the shelf is because they don't have what other books have. So they just sit there well most of the other books that are getting off the shelf are the happy @CAPS1, The @CAPS2 side, The @CAPS3,and all of the vampor books. It's because they have action, love, and etc.     The books that are on and off the shelf. Are maybe really good books. Some books don't ever leave the shelf it's probably because they are not. Really that great the reason for it is because the books that are on the shelf is. Because the book is  boring, or a old school book, they really don't have what the raeder is looking for. However the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the @CAPS2 side. That book has gotten sold faster than the movies.     The reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because. The books from the movies like the @CAPS2 side. Is bacuse the author gives more informotion on the movie. I heard that, that book is nothing like the movie the book is so much better than the movie because the book gives more informotion on the movie. So their for poeple really like books that from a movie.     They are more reasons why poeple like books now and days. You don't have to go to a book store anymore the books are now on your iphone, ipod, itouch,ipad and a nook,etc. So now you dont have to go to a book store anymore. You can get it on you iphone and other stuff poeple are raelly happy that they dont have too get up in the morning or when ever they get they books. They can however now just get them on the go.     So that is why books are now on the shelfs for good. Because you can get it on the go. But I believe that poeple whom ever like the feel of book. Should try and  just go out and get a iphone or nook something thaat saves you time while you are on your way to work or school	3	2	3
4021	2	If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, should they be able to get it removed? In the following I want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries.     If some parents see a book they are offended by, and they don't think their children should be able to get it from the library, they could just forbid them to read it. I don't think they should be able to remove it, even though they might think other children shouldn't be able to get it either, but that's not their decision. Every parent has to decide on their own, if they want their children to get certain books, but one parent shouldn't be able to decide for everyone else by removing a book.     Some people might be offended by certain books in libraries, but just because one person is offended by a book, doesn't mean that everyone else is going to be offended by it. Does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed? It is their personal opinion that they don't like it, but by removing it they would also keep other people from reading it, and that is not fair. Different people like different books, and are offended by different books, so if everyone would remove a book they don't like from the library, there wouldn't be any books left. I think if someone is offended by a book, they just shouldn't read it. They could tell their friends and family not to read it, because they thought it was offensive, but in the end everyone should decide for themselves.     I don't think people should be able to remove books from the libraries, but if the library itself thinks a book is offensive, then they shouldn't have it. It is their library, so it's their decision what books they want to have there. i also think that when the library doesn't have certain books, because they really pay attention to the books they take in their library, that that should be good enough for other people.     So all in all I don't think people should be able able to remove certain books, because everyone has their own opinion towards what is offensive, and what isn't. We all should be able to read or see, what we want to, and not what others think we should.	4	4	4
4030	2	I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me. Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them.    Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in. The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there. But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion. That just because they wrote that article, doesn't make it true.    This arguement went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my sterio and turned it off. She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it, I felt I would respect her feelings.    Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it. Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say. I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it, dont pick it up and read it.	3	3	3
4034	2	I believe certain materails such like books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and are inappropiate.      Why I believe @CAPS1 is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways. But when the people make and read these items they dont know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items from the maker. I also had experience a offensive book and a inappropiate book.      When I went to a public libary I picked up @CAPS1 book and said too my self ' @CAPS1 might be a good book I can do for my book report' so as I picked up the book and flip threw the pages I saw words and images that offened me.there was words that where calling color people out by there names and pictures of the color women getting rape or abuse.      So I did not get that book I just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong. So @CAPS1 white lady 'The libraryan' came up to me and asked me did I need help finding anything, but I did not answer her I just looked at her and shook my head.     As I walked threw the library I saw inappropiate books such as '@CAPS2 books' that these kids was looking at I could not believe what I was seeing. Becasue I think they should have these books some where else so that the younger kids will not get to these adult books including the music that always talk about @CAPS2, drugs, and gangs. Because I think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listing to because it can effect there futrure in life and also can cause violence, abuse, harrasment stuff that will get our younger childern in trouble as they get older.     I think all public libraries should have @CAPS1 type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of I.d to prove you are @NUM1 and older.	3	3	3
4051	2	Libraries.     What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers.	3	4	3
4054	2	The @CAPS1,     I read an intresting @CAPS2 the other day by Katherine Paterson an author. The @CAPS2 said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'      I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. of the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed. So I agree %@NUM1 with Paterson because people have their own opions. Some stuff @MONTH1 be more offensive than others to different people. I have observed people, and were all different so why should our thoughts be to? The answer is yes they should be different. But it is pretty simple if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back another person might find it intresting.      I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said. I am asking for your help to do so. I would like you to put the @CAPS2 in The @CAPS1 and hear what people have to say about it. Thank You for accepting my @CAPS4.                                                                      @PERSON2	3	2	3
4057	2	I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelfs in libraries. People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material like @CAPS1 shouldnt be around in libraries for children to read or we should have offensive material because @CAPS1 might help someone one day. Some times when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because @CAPS1's not treating people right. Then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch. Today im hear to tell that offensive material can help students in high school research for a project, @CAPS1 can also show us how offensive materials were back in the old days, and @CAPS1 can also teach us more about offensive material.      Today in are generation we do alot of studing or projects for school, we do this so we know more about the subject. As a high school student i would research the topic about offensive material. Why would you ask i do this? Because of researching this offensive material you can learn more about @CAPS1. Like where did @CAPS1 come from, why people are offensive, you could probably find out more than what you know and thats a good thing finding out what you dont know. So if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about @CAPS1 or know where @CAPS1 came from. Its good to still have have books that are  offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive.     Going to a library is fun and exciteding because you get to read all these books. Well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days. In are case we have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries. Lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days. Well in the library they will have generations of  books on offensive material. This provides us of offensive material back in the old days. So the library is a good thing to have that because we need to know  about what happend back in the old days.     Everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book. Well i know alot of people that would love to learn more about offensive material. Offensive material to people is like a good book you can read @CAPS1 and learn more about. Some people think learning to much is a bad thing exspecially when @CAPS1 is on offensive material. Learning to much is not even a discusion because people can learn whatever they want to. If the libraries take away the offensive material @CAPS1 is just like talking a good book from you.      People can think what they want to think about offensive material. Like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book, its like taking away a good book from a reader. People do need to learn about offensive material thats why we still have the books. If we didnt want to know about offensive material why did they publish all the books and videos about @CAPS1. This is why i think we should have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries	3	3	3
4072	2	Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indescent to read or not.     We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What @MONTH1 look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong @MONTH1 be completely normal to the individual they are making the decison for.     Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisons is one of the human races greatest talents. These descisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1. When the government is making decisions that effect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom?       When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. Theses ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books to?      In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types or movies, books, ect. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment.      I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions. This right should never be taken away from us	4	4	4
4085	2	I believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive. Children shouldn't be allowed to read books that have inappropriate pictures on them. Censored material can have bad influences on children. Scary movies can make children have nightmares. There should be restrictions against offensive materials.     Libraries contain plenty of books, music, movies, and magazines for everyone. Libraries also have some offensive items in them. Offensive material should be removed from libraries. Children don't need to see inappropriate material in libraries. Inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids.     Censored material such as offensive language, smoking, and alchol are extremely bad influences on children. Children don't need to say cuss words. Smoking can lead to cancer or death. Alchol is also addicting and can cause a person to become violent. Children shouldn't be able to see these inappropriate items in libraries.     Scary movies can give children nightmares. When I was a child, I saw a scary movie and I couldn't even sleep that night. Inappropriate movies need to have ratings so that kids don't watch them. Kids believe most of what they watch in movies. Movies should be restricted from children to watch them.     There is a lot of material in libraries that should be censored from children. Bad influences can have a bad effect on children. I believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children.	3	3	3
4097	2	@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4.      Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4. And yes, We all know that most people these days don't usually share.      To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want. Either get over @CAPS4.      Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion.     We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree.      Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2.'      No, I do not believe that books,music, and etc. should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6!?     I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book. I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music.     Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing . So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1. '@CAPS7 life'     @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager.     So basically I'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying.     You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree	2	2	2
4107	2	The libraries have to worrie about enough as it is with people not retuning books and stuff in. They do not want to lose there books, music, movies, magazines just because some people find the offensive. Why would we have to talk something out that offens one person but no one else has complainded about it being offensive. I know that you are asking me to thank like you to be able to see why it is offensive but i dont see how a book is going to be offensive.     When someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take. There are people out there would would read something that is offensive to them so that they can lern from it. There is no reason why if you dont like the libary that you can not go to a differnt one. There is no reason for you to have to get so offensive of books because the authors is just trying to get their point accross and expressing their feeling on the subject.     The way that i look at it is that you have two oppions. The frist being deal with it and go to the libary and get books. The second is dont go to the library if your going to be able to find something offensive. But know if you pick the second one then you must realize were ever you go you are going to find some thing the will make you feel offensive so your might as well just get over it and say yea i will go because its all around me. yes i know what you must be thinking why if its not a big deal then why dont you just take them out. Well you want an answer and i will give you one. Those books mayne you don't want to read them. But what if someone eles does its not fair to get reed of something just because afew people find it offensive know is it?     There for i say that no we are not going to take books, music, movies, magazines and anything eles out of the libraries. You will just have to deal with what you dont want in here its not like were going to make you read something that you take offensive to. We will not going to get reed of the books, music, movies, magazines or anything else that we the library has. That is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library	3	4	3
4109	2	There are many different perspetives on censorship in our country.  This is the human race, opinionative that is.  Different perspectives come from different people: young, old, parents, and children.  In libraries there are some reading materials, that some @MONTH1 find offensive.     Offensive material in libraries is @CAPS1 directed to be read by young children.  They are also @CAPS1 inteded to be able to get there hands on such material.  Even though this is @CAPS1 the purpose of that material, it happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it.  No the material is @CAPS1 held under lock and key, but it is also @CAPS1 left to lay at a child high shelf that would seem appealing to them.     The problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelfs, except for the children's books.  The material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories.  If we protected children from censhorship this would deny knowledge, and also a get away for some, from the general public that anually go to the library.\     @CAPS1 all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be.  Some material @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be appropriate for children, but they also are @CAPS1 all inappropriate.  A rated '@NUM1' movie @MONTH1 be just like a rated '@CAPS2' movie only with one extra reference, that @MONTH1 be taken in the wrong way.  Even protective parents @MONTH1 allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate.     Libraries should @CAPS1 remove this material from their shelves.  If it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children books in a seperate room of the library.  There are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children.  All of which do @CAPS1 have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves.     Censorship in libraries is a contraversial subject.  There is a very good arguement on either side of whether or @CAPS1 to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries.  I believe it should @CAPS1 be taken off and there are alternatives to this.  This essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone	4	4	4
4118	2	@CAPS6 are many books out @CAPS6 that, if looked into, have something obsene or vulgar in it. Despite the fact that children of certain ages probably shouldn't be reading these types of things, the book itself should not be banned from the shelves of libraries.      Authors write or type every word for a reason, whether happy or sad or vulgar. @CAPS6 is a reason the author wants the reader to read these 'offensive' things. Everything you read in a book is @CAPS6 because the author wanted you to read it, not to just put it @CAPS6 to fill in or to be nasty. I agree that children shouldn't read these books with that kind of material in them but that doesn't mean take the books down. The library where I live has sections for children, teens, and adults so that @CAPS6 is no confusion or concern of the content of the book. You have to be of age in order to take some of the readings home. I personally think that this is a great idea and will comprimise both sides that don't want their kids reading these books and those who want to read the book without getting rid of anything. If the latter was taken in to effect though, some of the classic and prize winning books would be taken off the shelves, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, The @PERSON1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4's @CAPS5, and much more. Such harsh actions aren't neccasary when a much simpler and more effective way to be accomplished.     Although offesive material is a concern for children @CAPS6 are much better ways to have it so they can't read them until ready. No book should be taken off a shelf for its content.	3	3	3
4120	2	I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be avalible to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes there are some very offincive items in a library, such as a book about racism to african americans. No, that person who takes offince in those itmes does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and or everybody.      Lets suppose you have a young child, and you take him/her to the public library with you. As your looking for a book the child reaches to the highest book that he/she can reach, pulls it off the shelf and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right infront of your child. Thats your own fault, not the librarys.     Although many times its not the librarys fault where certain books are at, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking.      I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area they must show a membership type of identification, and sign a waver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offince to anybody in which the customer is around.     And that is my view on this subject.	2	3	2
4121	2	Books being taken off the shelves?  No way!  The @CAPS1 is the place to go if you want books, movies, music, etc., that fit what you like and want.  Should some material be taken off the shelves all because of it offending someone else?  No, because Libraries are ment for everyone for a reason.     Everybody is diffrent.  Which means everyone comes to the @CAPS1 for diffrent types of information.  If the libraries took off all material that offended people there would be nothing left.  What offends someone @MONTH1 not offend someone else.  For example, the libraries have information on the @ORGANIZATION1 history.  While some people like that kind of information and want to continue learing about it, the information is also offending @CAPS2 @CAPS3 who it talks about.  But really if you think about it, its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about.  It would be keeping the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to.     When people go to the @CAPS1 they know, no matter what information their looking for, they will find it.   Isn't that whats so great about trips to the @CAPS1?  Looking and finding things you never learned about, even if it offends others. All that matters is that your head is holding more knowlege about that certain subject. It will never be okay to take certain material off the shelves that offends other people because libraries are ment for everyone for a reason	3	3	3
4131	2	Would you censor the @CAPS1? i @CAPS2 i sure would not. The @CAPS1 is a very percious and religoius part of our nation and history, but this is just a mere example. There are thousand of books, newpapers, articles, and media that play and important role in the history and the future of human beings.     Common sense or also referered as common knowledge is something that we dont pick up outa no where. We absoub it thought this that do, see, and read. An example is the 'The @CAPS4 @CAPS5' this is a book of a @CAPS5 that meets a young boy and the @CAPS5 is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy. Throught out the story the @CAPS5 gives the boy its apple, its branches, and even its trunk. but the @CAPS5 is happy. at the very end of the story they former young boy is now a old man that just wants a place to rest so the @CAPS5 straightens up his stumb and is just happy with @CAPS4 the old man his happiness. Now would you censor that?! That story reflects that helping someone is a key to life. That @CAPS4 someone else happiness is the true gift of life.      Now relegion is something that is censored alot these day... Why?! The @CAPS1 for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together. Indivigle tha stories are just little reminders of right and wrong,  kindness and jelousy. Its doesnt say if you have to follow every word and every sentence by day and night. its just helpfull advise, And really who has not asked someone else for advice? @CAPS8 relgion on tv, in schools, and everywhere else is telling us we dont need relegion for us to be productive and honest. Me coming from a roman catholic and christian background have never really went to church or read the @CAPS1 am swelled up about relegion. Thanks to a close friend.     @CAPS8 could also be good at its points though. For an example @CAPS8 adult type content from minors is helpfull sence little kids dont @CAPS2 much of anything. They just go with the flow. Another example is @CAPS8 mail sent to different countries. This helps keep our country safe from invasion and war.      so i will say that @CAPS8 can be a good thing but too much of it can be bad. Such as @CAPS8 relegious content, or @CAPS8 classical book that teach you common knowledge that will help aid you in the future. This stuff is something that should be @CAPS10 by ages and ages to come!	3	3	3
4139	2	Everywhere a person goes, there is always a media source. Media can range from newspapers, to magazines, to the radio, and through the television. Media is used to inform citizens of occuring events and to provide entertainment. Many media materials contain photos, langauge, and etc. that can be considered offensive to citizens. Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive.     In the @ORGANIZATION1, citizens have the freedom of speech. With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this right. If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject. Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to. Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials.     Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship. Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources. I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it. Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things.     Censorship can include anything from photos, to language, to news reports. People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials. Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of @LOCATION2, have to understand the violence and forces that were used. If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world-wide events.     Censorship effects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult. It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts. Censorship should not be allowed in the @LOCATION1 and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold	4	4	4
4147	2	Should certaine materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certaine materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people.     Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbimg or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing.     I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them. The material that is offending that person is not purposley put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy theresleves in whatever it is that they might be doing.     Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy. A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things.	4	4	4
4155	2	I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldnt get to read what they want to. I read world war @CAPS1 books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it.     I think they should age books like this book is for ages @NUM1, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines.	3	3	3
4164	2	I go to the libbrary every @DATE1 of every week. Although I don't really read that much. I usualy get movies or music. If I do get a book to read its usualy a magazine or something for school.     I don't think that books should be removed. If you don't read them it doesent mean that other people don't. If you don't like the book just ignore it and go on its simple as that. For instens if I found a book about @CAPS1 or about the @CAPS2 fathe I would not read it for my self but I would not take it down off of the shelf. Other people might want to read it. It's there choice to read it not mine.     It's like the radio know. The radio plays songs and cuts out the curis words. I don't think that they should do that because it messies up the songs lyrics and it is going aginst the artists words. The artist sings the song but people chang his or her words. To me I don't think thats right. It's also like telivtion now. You see the movie in theaters or on @CAPS3 and they have bad language or bad seens in them. When you watch that same movie on telivtion they take out about @NUM1 minuts of the movie because of th bad seen or they cut out the languge.     To me I think every thing should stay. I think if you don't want your kids to see it just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie it's not fair to the other people. If people don't like some music then just swich the radio station to another area on the radio. Theres no need to take the words out. Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way. I also think seence we are having to pay so much taxes I think we should get the privilage to come home and watch movies on telivtion and relax	3	3	3
4170	2	Today's books in are libraries are sometimes offensive. Yes, I know they are about thing that happen in history. Other books are not, some more than others. They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs,ect.      First, I don't want my children growing up thinking @CAPS2 okay to steal, do drugs, or anything of that sort. I'v seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries. The kids might think they are good books to read, I think other wise. Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them.     Secondly, @CAPS1 are fun to read, i know they are. You have to look at it this way im of age to read those kind of books but, letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people. If it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out. @CAPS2 not up to me, it takes more than one person to do that. It would'n be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way  i am.     Next, @CAPS2 okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to lesson to. As long as @CAPS2 okay to watch or lesson to. Im just saying what i think would be right. Not everone think's the same. People @CAPS3 @CAPS1 kids watch, and lesson to all kinds of music and movies. As long as @CAPS2 okay with the perant it should be okay.       Lastly, @CAPS3 kids be kids. Have them grow up the way they want to grow up. Yes, that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me. At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books.	3	2	3
4172	2	The idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated. Libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians. I believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives. Censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day.      Books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had throughout the years. I think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive it would only open the door to other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors behind closed doors.     Personally i enjoy reading. I think that with every book i read it opens the door to other beliefs and culturs that i would otherwise never learn about. Children need to be able to explore the world, to get to know how other civilizations grow and function as to how we in the @LOCATION1 function in our own little world that is getting more and more judgemental every day. The only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves.     I have always had a deep passion for music. When i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind. In my opinion, censoring music shouldn't be something that people even consider. Removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept.      Freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country. Now it seems as if everything we've been taught of our great @LOCATION2 has been nothing more than just a false cover to let the government control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves. Music is a freeing way to express oneself in a not so violent way. During the sixties and seventies, music was the way alot of people protested things like war and racism without being violent. Times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option.      I belive that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it actually is that way. We worry enough already about what other people think, why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different. If we all accepted the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be shown in our libraries	4	4	4
4174	2	I feel that censorship in libraries is not needed. There are ways around your child having to be subjected to certain things you don't want them to be subjected to. If you don't want your child to witness certain types of material that is on you, not the libraries. We have libraries for the sole purpose of variety what is the point in having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone. There are ways around completely taking certain things off the shelf if they are that explicet then they can be put in a section just for adults. No I do not belive certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     One reason why it is not necessary to take certain things off the shelf is if you don't want your child to read or see certain things okay that's fine then watch them and see what they try to pick up and read or watch. Your child doesn't have to anything if you don't want them to. It's like saying I don't like this telivision show I never want my child to see it well what are the odds that telivision show is going to stop playing just becase your not happy with the violents,drug use,language, ect. The odds are extremely unlikely. When you don't want you child to see that certain show what do you do you watch them and keep them from watrching it so why should there be any differance when it comes to the books they are subjected to in a library.     Another reason would be the sole purpose of a libray is to give variety  to the people a place where there is something for everyone. Just because you think something is horrible and no one should read, hear, or see doesn't mean that some one else won't like it, it could be someone else's favorite book,magazine,cd, or movie. One oppinion shouldn't count for so much. If you don't like a book,movie,magazine, cd or agree with the content fine your entitled to your own oppinion then don't check it out no one is making you. If they took something off the self everytime they got a complaint about it there would be nothing left. If they were about to try and accomidate everyone they @MONTH1 as well just give up and close all libraries down all around the world because there will be nothing left on the selves.     Also instead of taking them completly off the shelf if they are that explicet maybe make an eightteen and older section. It would solve a lot of problems. Yes I agree that there are a select few books,magazines,movies,ect. that younger people should not be subjected to, but as and adult you should be able to read,watch,and hear whatever you want. That right shouldn't be taken away just because there are children that come to libraries. Every library I have ever been to there are certain sections and if your child stays in the section where there type of books are then they should be fine. Aside from that though an eightteen and older section would solve a lot of conflict.     No I do not belive certain material should be taken off the selves if they are found offensive. There are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves. I don't want to go to a library one day and there be literally nothing left because they took a book off the self every time someone had a problem with it. There is absolutly no reason why we can't figure spomething out to make everyone happy and I think that having the eightteen and older section would be a good start. For the whole i don't want my child to be sujected to those kinds of things then keep your child away for those kinds of things nobody is forcing them to read anything you don't want them to	4	4	4
4179	2	In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?	3	3	3
4182	2	When you want to read that one special book you heard about but you find out it was considered offensive to some what would you do? The public libraries will take all offensive material off shelves for noone to read. Then that one special book you wanted to read is now off limits. A book someone worked hard on or a song or movie is now stored away because of a little contraversy. Do you find that to be fair to our rights?     I find the fact of cencorship a very confusing topic in public libraries. If someone is to write and publish a book then someone will want to read it. If some find it offensive then no one can read it how is that fair to the people who do enjoy it? The way it should be done is if you dont like it dont read it dont just take it away from all who would want to read it.      There are some material in libraries i think should be censored to a certain degree. Such as anything with nudity or adult content. That dose not mean though it should be taken away. The stuff with this content should not be taken away but in a seleted area for only adults to view. Many movie stores and book stores have the same idea so why dosent the library just adopt that idea.     We as @CAPS1 have the right to freely state our opinions and what we believe. If someone wants to write a book on what they think is right then they are allowed to do that. If you censor something just because you dont like what they say that is violation of the constitution. You are allowed to express your opinion about it but taking it away cause you @MONTH1 not like it is wrong to do.     Do you find it fair that people spend so much money and time in writting a book and a few people find it offensive so noone can view it anymore? I say if someone spends there time and effort then it should be allowed for those who do enjoy it. Is it really so hard for you not to pick up a book that you @MONTH1 find offensive. Censorship is good in some cases but inforcing it to much on what someone calls offensive is againts our right to freedom of expression.	4	3	4
4183	2	Should offensive material be censored?     Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this. A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents @MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents @MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also @MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents @MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @MONTH1 be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people @MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.     Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, @NUM1's, and burned onto @CAPS1, there's no removing it. Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person @MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?	4	4	4
4196	2	Living in todays society there are many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions. There are an uncountable number of diffrent ways people look at the world and ways that people percieve things. To tell someone what they should and should not know is simple minded in the aspect that anyone can percieve a book, music, movie, or magazine diffrently.     @CAPS3 quote by Katherine Paterson,in short, metophorically uses a book and a shelf to let the reader comprehend the importance of information that is passed down from generation to generation. The book represents the information in the world and the shelf stands for the the place the imformation is stored for one to go seek information.     To remove the book off the shelf indefinatly is to close the mind of a future generation. It was once said ' you can not know your present without knowing your future.' @CAPS1 the book @MONTH1 offend one reader it could also inspire another as well. Everyone has a diffrent opinion and life style. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people are granted with better lifestyles than others, @CAPS2 are unfortunatly living everyday in struggle.      One book that @MONTH1 offend a person who thinks the book is harsh and should be taken off the shelf, could also inspire a young child going through struggle's to overcome there surroundings and be a better person.      I have read many books that did not interest me and passed them on to my sibligs and friends. Shockingly the book interested them. After interviewing my siblings and friend over the book it turns out that they got a diffrent message from the book than I. No one thinks the same thoughts a hundred percent of the time.      '@CAPS2 @MONTH1 argue that the glass is half empty while others argue it is half full.' @CAPS3 quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today. Ultimatly if everyone thought the same then everyone would be the same person. To 'leave no books left on the shelf for any of us' is like programing a robot to only do what you say.      In such a diverse community it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf. Living in todays society there many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions	3	4	3
4202	2	Censorship has been the topic of many debates involving politicians, @CAPS2 activists, and the everyday citizen. There are groups that believe the government has every right to censor anything that is considered offensive in today's society. Some individuals could argue with this belief by supporting the statement that it is not the government's position to decide what is considered offensive and what is not. I just so happen to agree.      One opinion, mainly supported by people with children, is that books, music, and movies ect. should be censored to protect the younger generations. While it is true that parents should be concerned with what their children are exposed to, if the offensive material that is involved in the everyday life of an adult is completely restricted from an individual as a child how is he or she expected to be prepared and excel in the future? Why do we go to school for atleast twelve years of our lives? We go to prepare ourselves for the challenges of being an adult. We place ourselves in an environment that is specifically created to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity. If not properly exposed to something, there is absolutely no way to be prepared to encounter it in the future.      However, not all individuals support censorship because of their children. There are adults that would like to see no more of today's offensive material for their selves than they would want their children to see. My rebuddle to this is that if you do not want to see it then do not choose to see it. No individual is ever forced to be exposed to anything in todays media. Turn off the television if the program bothers you. Do not read the book or magazine. Change the radio station. Every person is capable of controlling what they hear and see, and it is unnessecary to attempt to remove from society what could simply be ignored.      Lastly, one of the most consistent debates around censorship is that the government should control what is included in today's media. Think back in @LOCATION1's history; when has giving the government more power in our everyday lives ever been good for our society? The reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from in @LOCATION2. The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 was created to insure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control. The freedom of speech is not just referring to what comes from an individual's mouth, but what goes into their eyes and ears as well. The citizens of this great country are more than capable of deciding for theirselves what is offensive to them and what is not.     It is the government's duty to protect our country from other countries and groups of people who attempt to break it apart, but not to control what we see and hear. Meeting and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom. I ask why some individuals would want to give one freedom we do have away? The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the greatest countries ever to exist, yet we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives? It is time for our society to stop being nurtured by the government and start doing our own dirty laundry	5	4	5
4206	2	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,      I believe that the country should take off all the books, movies, magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover, or any offensive mind grabbing, sexal contact in any of the  story, music, etc. Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitten around, the radio for example, the music that they put on like rap, hip-hop with all the cusin and singing about mony, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio, and adalt books that are sitten around in @ORGANIZATION1 ready to be read by adalts, not children.The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day just not when there @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old looking at pornograghic magazines, and movies. So I hope you keep this in mind get that stuff off the streets and not into childrens hands.	3	2	3
4207	2	Banned books.'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work that I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                                                         Katherine Paterson                                                          Author     I believe and will stand by katherine's statement above. Who @CAPS5 to say if a book @CAPS5 offinsive? People have a right to their oppinion, but i do not think any one has the right to take books away from a @CAPS1 library.      @CAPS1 library, the facts are in the name. It @CAPS5 a @CAPS1 library, where people can go and find a book to pass time, a book to use on an @CAPS2 assignment, or a book to read to their child. Taking a book off the shelves just because it offendid someone does not makes sense to me. A person can pick up a book, be offended and complian about it, that @CAPS5 freedom of speech. I do not see fault in that. But when a person picks up a book, @CAPS5 offendid,and demand that the book per se @CAPS5 taken off the shelves of a @CAPS1 library. That @CAPS5 when i have issues seeing where they think they have the right.     Katherine Paterson said in her text that 'If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then you aslo have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelve for any of us.' @CAPS3't that a scary thought? If a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelve at his or her own will? I fear the out come of that. I am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book.      Taking books off the shelve @CAPS5 taking knowledge away from the people. We as @CAPS4 have the right to read at our pleasure, any book that we have the slighest whim to read, and be able to read that book with out prosecution from a people that find the book in question 'offensive.'     The day we let people take books off the shelves because they offend them, @CAPS5 the day our first admendment fails. As a nation we need to stand stron againts banning books from @CAPS1 libraries. For our generation and for the many generations to follow.	3	3	3
4208	2	One @MONTH1 subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion.  I personally disagree with the concept.  The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences.  Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion.       Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons.  First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and priviledges upheld in the face of the law.  Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public.  The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted.       Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries.  The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar.  We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that.       Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society.  I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship.  '@CAPS5 @NUM1,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens.  '@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though I have not read the composition myself.  '@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar.  All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization.       In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method.  In any case, a more effective solution must exist today.  To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place.       Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity.  The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces.  Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings.  Different regions utilize different systems, but that of  the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe.       As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all.  Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor.  Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years.  Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset.  It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose	5	5	5
4237	2	Many things such as books, music, magazines, ect., causes problem acts for children to act different, but i say that everything should stay in the library because there more things that causes acts than the things that are listed. Many children get their acts from books, movies, and magazines but most get their acts from something different.   Children gets most of their acts from the television that their viewing at home wich causes them to think if their parents doesn't care about what their watching than it's okay to view what ever.So the most that is causing acts is what is being viewed at homes or in the movies. So I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch what evers legal on television.   But to me in the the libraries it's up to whoms ever controling it should decide by ages. just like legal things only legal for adults. I say that it's only for adults because childern starts argument from what ever they see expecially when their around their friends. When children is around their friends they feel that it's cool to do what ever. And it's all coming from thing based on violence in the books that children reads more often. So to me I will say that it shouldnt be okay for what is being viewed.	3	3	3
4250	2	To whom it @MONTH1 concern:     The idea of censoring books, music, movies, or anything else from libraries or from the public eye is very offensive. There are many things that could come off as 'offensive' to any individual. Taking books or anything off the shelf because someone felt that it did not go with their certain morals or beliefs is against the writer's freedom of speech. It also can start serious issues with feuding religious groups or persons of different ideas. This also shows that the library, or so far as the country, is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed.      One of the biggest concerns is that the freedom of speech is taken away. It @MONTH1 be something as trivial as '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' now, but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it, then our freedom is taken away. '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' was brought up because a mother had actually gotten a certain book of the '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' @CAPS4 taken off the shelf, because her child had gotten scared of the halloween edition. The fact that something could be banned for something so trivial is a frightening thought. There weren't many cases of this specific @PERSON1 scene scaring all the kids, so there was no need to get it banned. When someone finds something even a tad wrong they want it banned and thrown away, never again allowed to be shown to those that @MONTH1 even find an interest in it.     A big thing that @MONTH1 conflict with censorship is the idea of religion. The @CAPS5 is a published work, whether it is religious or not. Who's to say that it can't be banned? What if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive? This could cause even more conflicts between religious parties, and in turn anything religious would be banned all together. That small, faint line between state and religion is going to get blurred solely from censorship. If the @CAPS5 or works for catholics get banned, then so could published works for wiccans, muslims, buddhists, and any other sources of religion. There would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in. Not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works. It will then become a topic far less talked about, for they would be afraid of getting into legal or social trouble for expressing their thoughts and feelings with their spirituality or religion.     This censorship will only cause future issues. This could lead to not only the religious books being banned, but anything that strays from the social norms. If someone was homophobic, they @MONTH1 start having a gay author's works banned, or just a book about the @CAPS7 community banned. That small sense of security those in that community have in those books will be taken away. Personally, I find comfort and my sense of being alone is dulled by these books. There @MONTH1 even be a possibility that some books, not necessarily just @CAPS7 books, hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to. It is a world someone loves to enter, to hide or confide in. To take someone's mental safety is worse than taking their physical safety.     Most people do not realize what sort of trouble they will start with censorship. It @MONTH1 mean nothing, but those that decide whether or not to censor something have to think of the picture at large; Do they lose customers for keeping it on the shelf? Or do they lose customers, and stop giving the rights of freedom of speech? It is a heavy decision to make but the decision could make or break the publishing group or legal party	5	5	5
4253	2	the author ketherine paterson is like letting you know like life is going to dont be behain go forword and grab the book from the shelf fot you and for your children because most of the book are gone because other people got them. i would go to the library and grab the book from the shelf for me and my kids. mom can grad some good books for the kids like a book that have the parts of the body grammer so they can start learning something rite no that they are lilttle and they will ganna star to make sentences.in @DATE1 in warsaw school the principal decide to remove everything from the library because people didnt go and check out books,music,movies,megazines, etc he decide to remove them because people didnt check out nathing and most of the people put everything in obserbation but my question is why people didnt check out something for their kids so they can start to read to learn something from their moms school. in my  opinion if i would the principal of the school i wouldnt take of the books nathing about the library i would live everything so they can grab the books from the shelf and check them out so the kids start to lear how to read they ganna learn something special from their mom.	1	1	1
4258	2	I think that no @CAPS1, Book, @CAPS2, or any sort of music should ever be takin off the shelf, if u dont like what they say in these @NUM1 catagories dnt wach listen read or anything.  Just because u dont like it doesnt meen somebody else doesnt.  I mean think about it is there a @CAPS1 or a song or a sintance thats so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf i say no.  Also beacuse somebody might have not got to read see or listen to that @CAPS1 song or book ya no what i mean.  Plus all that money and time and hard work it took to make the song, book or @CAPS1 it takes up to like almost @NUM2 years for a @CAPS1 to come out and when a song comes out u hardly even no its new because they never tell you like listen to bullet for my valentin's new song on @NUM3 or anything and when a new book comes out it's usually like harry potter or somthing like that but no, no @CAPS1 should ever be takin off the shelf's nor book nor music nor magizine.                                                                                                          @ORGANIZATION1	2	2	2
4276	2	What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is.                                                Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand. Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. They use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless. People love movies. It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive. But, it's not up to anybody else. Magazines help people keep up with news. Most of the news can be very offensive. It is the people around you causing the offensive news. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news.                                          Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way. Everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel?	4	4	4
4295	2	Do you ever feel like books, music, movie, magazines and etc., are offensive sometimes? To my experience of lising to music and watching movies it can be offensive somtimes with out even knowing it. I have lisn to rap before and all the cuss words they use, and watching movies with only white people or black people. So I think some music, moives and etc., could be taking off.     If I think somthing is a offensive I pretty much blow it off like its nothing. I do that beacuse I have watch @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 the white and black people didnt get a long, and they had to play football to geather. Then they finally got along and won the champion game. To me I think thats awesome beacause people were offensive, and got over it and now there friends. So  dont take @CAPS3 offensive. I say that beacuse how do you know that the actor or the writer was or is talking about you. I look at this like its a little deal. I like @CAPS3 like that I find it entertanment. It can also help you learn, about whats happening to our world, and what we have acomplished. So I really dont take this @CAPS3 a offensive. But, other people can take it offensive and thats there problem. There is nothing that can be done its over with. If something is a offensive then dont lisn to it or dont watch or read it. So dont think its right to pull it of the shelf and abhor it. They can have a really good meaning behind it. There are many movies, songs and books in the world that are good. So dont abominate it and go on in life dont let @CAPS3 get to you.     Thats why I dont think its right to pull it off the shelf and take it offenisive. Thats why I think it not bad to take @CAPS3 offensive.	3	2	3
4313	2	I think that we should remove certain things like movies, music and books should definitely be a debate because in these days people are doing things that they never done before.     For an example music, music is a great cause of things that people motivate to do things and get really into the songs. They try to do the same things as what there favorite artist or actor does. I hear some songs and they talk about illegal things and I look around the world I hear children talking about those things and they tell there parents what is that ? But they just dont want to tell them the truth but once these kids get older they will know what it is and it will be there choice if they want to follow that path or think about something else. But about the people who are singing this, they're putting it in a way that is not bad you could do this all the time and enjoy it with out getting introuble and in reality these kids are blind and dont know what there getting them selves into.     Also, many books have offensive language that kids read all the time but people dont even notice. That's how kids could get introuble in school because they learn a new word in some book they never read or cant even read cause there to young to understand but they do it anyways beacause of curiosity, they dont know what there doing. Thats a way how a child becomes bad cause person when he or she becomes older cause they learned things that they shouldnt have learned. I think that we as a good country should make sections into what people can read and cant read, and it should depend how old is the person.     Some school librarys, have movies that kids could watch and it could be if your a elementry school, middle school etc. But some of these movies have offensive language and some appropriate scenes, that kids would want and learn how to do those type of things. Or how they see the actors in the movie and they curse and they think is cool cause there doing it as well. I think that elementry students should watch only pg movies, middle school pg @NUM1 and down, and for the high school, we should be able to see basically any movie, but in the same time I think most of the high school students have to be more mature, thats probably why we still dont have the priblige to see any movie cause peolpe dont know how to handle them selves.     Finally, I really think they should minimum some movies, music and books cause kids are learning things they shouldnt be learning until they get older, and that those three things change the world in so many diffrent ways, some are good but most of them are bad, these are my opinions.	3	4	3
4318	2	Books, magazines, movies, and music are created with a huge diversity. Fiction, @ORGANIZATION1, horror, fashion, sciencefiction, and many more categories of literature are made. There is something out there everyone will enjoy. What would you do if you did not have the choice to read, listen to, or watch the materials you like because someone else had an ill opinion of it?     Everyone has an opinion. It @MONTH1 be in favor of something or it @MONTH1 not be. I believe every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf. To some people it @MONTH1 be offensive, but that does not mean they have to read it. Someone @MONTH1 enjoy a piece of work  another finds offensive. It is all a matter of opinion. The opinion of one person should not effect materials being able to be on a shelf or not.      If you walked into a libraray and the shelves were filled with books, but only books everyone had a good opinion about the shelves wouldn't seem very full. It is hard to get two people to agree on the same thing. Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on the literature in a public libraray. Censorship is understandble to an extent, but I believe the libraries should organize all their literature into categories and sections. In these categoires and section people @MONTH1 look for the materials they wish to see and avoid the offensive materials they do not.      Libraries have rated @CAPS1 movies. Many people could consider rated @CAPS1 movies to be offensive, but many people could enjoy watching rated @CAPS1 movies. Who wins, the people who find then offensive or the people who enjoy them? It is a hard choice to make. I believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them. The same goes for books, magazines, and music. If you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it.     There are hundreds of different sytles of writing, plots of movies, lyrics of songs, and covers of magazines. They have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles, and plots. They can not censor things just because some people find them offensive. Others @MONTH1 enjoy them. What would you do if your favorite book was not allowed in your public lirbaray	4	4	4
4322	2	Do you believe that books or any different materials should be removed from the libraies shelf. No, because them books or materials is not for everybody to look at. Like if you have kid's you should keep them and a kid's area. We cannot just start takeing down every book off the shelf because it was not a good book.The reason why kid's should stay and the kid's area is so they want pick up that book thats not for them. We will need the read to be reading childrens book.If a kid's pick up a bad book you should explaine to them that this book is not for them. Some books are @CAPS1 for kid's to read. so thats why they have there on area to be in. Kid's should not leave there area for a @CAPS1 book. I think that kids should list to appropiate music and a libriary.  The @CAPS1 book or materials are not for the kid's to read so they should not be and that area to pick up a bad book. i feel like there are no bad book out there if you dont like the book maybe someones elese will. but like movies, music, and magazines should not be off the shelf because if it was @CAPS1 it would not be and the libriary and the first place. Everybody is not going to like everything but thats just life	3	3	3
4324	2	I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it, to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. sSome movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people @MONTH1 not and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books @MONTH1 cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books.      In alot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't apriciate what they say in the song then dont listen to that group. There are some rap artist that say some things people might not like but, you dont have to listen to them there are alot more bands and diffrent kinds of music to choose from. It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see.     In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that alot of people @MONTH1 not know. If parents dont like there children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy haveing there kids read.	3	3	3
4332	2	The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed acces to the library. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.     Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive.     In the @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear @CAPS3 a part. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library.     Another freedom given to the @CAPS2 people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what.     Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term ' @CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @CAPS6 or @NUM1. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated @CAPS6 movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to videogames there are ratings and generes. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem.	4	4	4
4348	2	I disagree with library censorship. Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas. If certian books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read.     If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate. In my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things.     Books can also help children to escape from every day life.Admitedly, children should not always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionaly they need too. I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things. If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers.     Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations. If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination?  It is impossible!     In recent online polls, parents who's children can access books say that their children to better in school and in every day life. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies. With this knowlege they can learn with less difficulty and can excell in acedemics with ease.     In conclusion, If certian books are censored from the libraries they will be inavailable for children to read. Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life. Do not let libraries censor books!	3	4	3
4349	2	Some materials in libraries @MONTH1 have information that is offensive towards others.  But should they be removed if they are found offensive? Some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is. But materials @MONTH1 be removed if it is sexual, racist, or life threatening offense.     Some material @MONTH1 have offensive comments that is sexual. If its an offense that is sensored and the author or artist of the material went too far, then that @MONTH1 be a good reason for the material to be removed.  It @MONTH1 make the person feel emotions that bring them down.  It @MONTH1 also make the person feel violated and offended.     There @MONTH1 be material that has racist comments.  Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today.  It is something that starts fights and arguements.  It also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves.  Racism can cause people to feel very hurt also. So if there is too much racism in a material, then that should be removed.     There are some material that @MONTH1 have offense that seems life threatening.  Say that it is a book about the whole nation and the author slips in something that @MONTH1 seem like the nation would be in danger, someone @MONTH1 feel offended and want that material removed.  Material with too much threat in it @MONTH1 make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen.  They would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves.     So should offensive materials be removed from the shelves? Yes they should.  If they were to be found sexually, life threatening offense or had racist comments, they should be removed so individuals won't feel these offenses are life threatening, hurtful, or cause negative emotions	3	3	3
4360	2	Censoring any type of media such as books, magazines, movies, or music from a library is not right. A library is huge amount information put common places for people to seek out knowledge.When something is found offensive, you should not hide it a away as though it was never there. If any media is offensive, it should be the person who is looking up the information to choose if he/she wants to use it.When someone for example a child has something offensive, the first thought is to take it away from the library or television.Instead, just explain what it is there looking at and they will eventually understand the reason it is offensive, but how does someone know what is offensive or not?Just because something is found offensive by one or two people does not make it right to just take it away. It should be talked about or discused by groups of people on the subject then decided whether or not it should be taken off the shelves for being offensive.If there is a book or magazine on the shelve and it might be offensive it should a decision made by the people surrounding that type information to take it off the shelve and not to be hidden away.	3	3	3
4368	2	I believe that the book that none of us read. It should not be on the shelf of any book store i think if the grow up does read it no child should have the right to. Also some of the music that is on shelf should be remove from all store. Children under the age of @NUM1 shouldnt have any way to get some of this rated r music centrain music shouldnt be on shelfs for little kids to get a hold to.           So now lets get to the movies that are playing in some of these shows. No child under @NUM1 should be able to see half of the things that are showing  and movies because no child should be expose to such things that grow up are most likely expose to. That is another way that young children are doing half of the things that they doing the peoples that make certain movies need to think about the children how they would act toward the ones they make.               Most magazines that are being sold today is giving children the wrong idea. When magazine are fill with alot of he say she say things the kids in the world do nothing but think its foreal or ok to do that is spent off the wrong message to the young children. And i know you are thinking to yourself like how is that true well kids these days listen to what ever they think is right and half of these magazines make things sound so real.	3	3	3
4372	2	Some books are offensive but not all of them. Some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive. I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries.     One reason I do not believe that there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it. Some libraries do not carry @PERSON1 books because he uses curse words. They should not remove the books completely they should just warn people of the language.     A second reason why I do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed. I once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the @CAPS1 religion. This was a horrible action because the @CAPS1 religion is an extremely interesting one and now many people will never know anything about it.     A third reason is that they @MONTH1 end up offending some people by removing a book. I once heard of an @CAPS3 family complaining about a library because they removed a book about the @CAPS3 religion. I found this upsetting because everyone deserves to have access to the books that they want.     I propose that instead of censorship the libraries seperate the books by different subjects and genres then put up signs warning anyone that goes into that section. This way everyone can get the books that they want to get. The libraries also would not have to worry about people being offended.     I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries. Some libraries have begun to censor their book selection by removing ones they thought could be offensive.Some books are offensive but not all of them.	4	3	4
4374	2	At jefferson'vill high school we do't have the right to remove a book form the shelf if there a book that not for you do not get it like a bad movie . It like get a bad lunch your not go to get it so why get a bad book or a movi	1	1	1
4377	2	I believe that not all books should be banned, but some books should. For example their are many good books that are banned because it @MONTH1 have a little bit of cussing in them but I believe that is ok, I mean it isn't like the child wouldn't hear the same words maybe even worse if he turned on his @CAPS1. But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion.     For example I read a very famous book called The @CAPS2 of @PERSON3 by @PERSON4. This was a very good book but for some reason it was banned in my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 so I couldn't check it out. I had to go to the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to get it. I don't understand what is so wrong with The @CAPS2 of @PERSON3 that it is banned by @ORGANIZATION2. This book @MONTH1 talk of a mischevious youngster who runs away, does alot of differnt crazy activites, and even smokes but this is no worst then what we are exposed too on @CAPS1.     If I was a administrator in a @ORGANIZATION1 I would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express. For example if a book is offensive to some one for instance a book written by the @PERSON1, this piece shouldn't be aloud on the shelve. But if it is a book about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and the @ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery this would be ok. Because the @PERSON2 book is more hate than anything it is for instance promoting the @PERSON2 and that isnt right. But the book on the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and the @ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery is a part of our history it shows differnt ways of thinking of the time that we don't really know if they were right or wrong it is just what they believed.     So my point I am trying to express in this piece is that don't hate a book because maybe the language in it or the events in it @MONTH1 not be what you agree with but judge the book because of the message that it is trying to express.Hopefully you will agree with me in this.     But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion. I have expressed my opinion on this matter I hope you agree with me and can maybe convince the @ORGANIZATION1 that they need to take a second look at what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we take off our shelves.	4	4	4
4378	2	Whever you go these days you see viloence in evry store around the world. Children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output. Alot of the kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there.               I think that the offensive thing's should be taken off the shelves. And sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores were it allows young teenagers to buy those products , then we are just puting ourselfs at harm. I was just in a book store the other day and i seen magazines that were not apporiate. I thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines. Music , movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store , that's why its called a book store.                It's not called a movie, music , or magazine store they call it a book store for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive they are going to grow up thinking it's ok. Too be that way or treat somebody different because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store just take the offensive one's and have a twenty one or older sign. So the kids dont end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't.               When i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. Alot of the time my mom would take the book from me. Because it was offensive, i didn't know that at the time i was just a little kid. In today's society kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and thats not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books.               I guess it does'nt really matter for middle school and high school kids. Because those kids really dont like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for is the one's in elementary. Because those kid's actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it. And those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you.               In the end it does'nt really matter what i say because people are going to keep making books. Anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make. It does'nt matter if it is negative or a possitive book. the company wants to make money and so does the author.	3	3	3
4380	2	Since the beginning there has always been someone who is offended by certain media. Books, movies, and music have been the main focus of the subject of this controversy. There have been arguments over it so severe that it has went to court! The people that have been upset over media have caused there to be certain censorships over these materials.           I believe that there should not be censorship in media. I think that there are are books, movies, and other media materials that can be found offensive to someone or a group of people. This is why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what could cause someone to become upset by it. If something is considered too vulgar for the public eye then they should have it somewhere more discret, but not be taken off the shelves. I disagree that media materials should be taken of shelves for being offensive. Media is all about someones free expression and trying to share it with the world. There are around @NUM1 billion people in the world and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media you do.     A great example of a media material that is challenged every day in every part of the world is a book called the bible. The bible is considered to be one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print. People of different religions can sometimes find the print of bibles over there religious books offensive and there is always great controversy about it. All these movies and books though are great because they are different and free! The world needs people who challenge ideas and religions. Every single person in the world is unique and I think it is great for everyone to put their opinions out for others to find so they can have a new view on the subject or at least contemplate it.     Society has already put parental advisory warnings on cds, put ratings on movies, and labeled books as challenged. All this does is restrict the public from finding new ideas to compare to and form opinions. I believe in freedom of thinking because it is the most valuable resource that we have, it is what sets us apart from each other. Let media be free so men, women, and children from all over the globe can be unique and wonderful! Censorship will be challenged in years to come and I will help challenge it for all to be free and happy	3	4	3
4381	2	Books,music,movies, and magazines that are in libraries should be approprete material. But in some cases it's fine to have some offensive litature because people can learn from it. But there needs to be an age limit to checking out these itims out. So I do beleave we should keep offensive litature on the shelve. There needs to be a certian exstent to what we leave on the shelves.     Books,books, and more books, there are so many books and many other kinds of litature in libraries today. Libraries are a place of silance, and to some people thats boreing. So like me when I go into a librarie I go to the books, or maginzes that seem very intresting to me. Altho they @MONTH1 seem intreseting to me, others @MONTH1 find them offensive. Like it might be a comic book that my say something that someone my take offense to.      Libraries can't please everyone that walks throught the doors. Just because someone dose not like the offensive stuff thats in there dosen't mean they have to take it out. Because there might be someone like me that likes thoes kind of books, or magazines. There are offensive stuff all over the world so you can't avoid it every where you go. I beleave there is a good out come for keeping offensive litature material on the shelves.      I think that keeping offensive material in libraries @MONTH1 have a good cause to it for one very good reason, learning. Like I said before it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but to some it's not. So some people might like to learn about offensive things. @MONTH1 be they never knew thoes things that are in thoes books. They @MONTH1 also never know whats in thoes books unless they keep them on the shelves. They need to have a section where offensive books,magazines,music and movies go. If some things it's offensive put it on the shelve, and they must be @NUM1 years old to check it out if it's on that shelve.       Yeah there @MONTH1 be a down fall to keeping offensive things in libraries. But you can't hide from it all your life .So insted of going out into the world and learning about it the hard way go to the librarie. You could pick a book up learn about it and how to deal with it. It's just part of live there is offensive material every where. You can't be shelterd your whole live.       So in my greatest opinon I do beleave that we should keep these offensive material in libraries, it could be a learing exsperiance	3	3	3
4383	2	I think that the cencorship in libraries should defenetly be relevant.  Such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk.  Many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow.  A cencory system should be a quit simple arrangment fot the public library systems. Private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law.  On the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children.  For example in many libraries around the @CAPS1.S there all books called manga or anime books alot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated @NUM1+.  I think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if  you want to change them or not	3	2	3
4387	2	Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that could be offenesive should or should not be pulled off the shelves? I beleave they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have diffrent types they like.     Companies that manufactor books, movies, music, and magazines would be looseing out on money if people cant find something they like. and if they dont have the money to make whatever it is they make then they will go out of buiesness. They you might be out of luck for what you are looking for.     All kinds of people buy things that they like. How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shevles because it offened people? Well thats how they feel when that happens to them.      What would be put in there places? Stores have to have something to fill the shevles. Would they put more candy to make the world fat?      If you come across something you think is offensive just dont pay attenion to it. Others @MONTH1 like it like you like your favorite candy. We have a great number of other things you can pick from	3	3	3
4392	2	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with @CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4. But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away.	5	4	5
4394	2	A place fill of knowleged should be a place where you can find all the news that is making the world what it is today, a person should be able to find out things from the past also. A library has many different things found in it: books, magazines, movies, and some have music. The books range from encyclopedia's to @PERSON1, the varity of books and information is to the extreme. But then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information. With all the profanity found in today's society you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library.     Books are put into a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more knowledgable. The thought of a younger person going into the older, adult area is very upsetting but then again who's to say that that individual is not allowed to read an article or magazine that has more mature type's of information or language found in them. I feel that a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read, fact of the matter is they have the right to.      Both, young and older people need to be educated in the worlds past history and the present news. One reason being to prevent things that happend in the past, happening again. Another reason is just so that they know what is going on around them and so that the individual is informed.      Libraries should have banners or flaps up saying what is in a certain section of that specific area and people can make the decision to go over to those area's or not. Things that are found 'not right' in one's eyes @MONTH1 not seem so bad to anothers, it's all in personal preference. Things should still be out for the public to read or see.     Making the choice to go into a library is an individuals decision. Fact is that the library is a place where a person should be able to get knowledge, no matter what type of information.  A person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others.	4	4	4
4396	2	Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle?     Everyone in this world is entitaled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people @MONTH1 be right to others. For example, one family @MONTH1 view their children using curse words as offensive while another @MONTH1 see no problem. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence disscused in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear.     It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability so see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspecitves does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the aknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored.     In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion.	4	3	4
4397	2	Do i think that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, ect., should be removed from the shelves.? No i do not think that some of these materials should be removed. Why? because nowadays kids read things such as gang violevce and things that dont involve school material but some kids find the books that they read interesting. Now, do i thing that the books should be not given to students who are very young of age? Yes, due to the fact that some books are a little above others age of reading.     Sometimes you @MONTH1 have kids who are intrested in what others dont read. Books such as gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories of which some cant read. I think that in this case kids under certain age shouldnt read these books because of some of the content that is involved in it. Kids find these books, movies and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books. Im not saying that its a good thing, but im saying that the things they read and see in those books and movies are things that some of us have seen in a everyday life.     When I was younger, I went to a library in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 and whenever a kid would choose a big that wasn't for hiim/her they would always say 'you need your parents permission to check this book or magazine ect. out'. Once I actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this I thought that it was a good idea. I figure that all libraries should be like this considering that kids shouldnt read books that arent for them. This is also a good way to get kids from reading things that not age appropriate to finding something that is.     So the main answer to this suggestion is, no, I dont think that these materials should be moved from shelves out of libraries. Why? because once they are gone then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because of the books that they find interesting are gone. So my suggestion is to not move them and let them stay on shelves just as any other book would	3	3	3
4399	2	There are certain books that no child should ever read but in some libraries they don't care whats on there shelf. They don't care if a little kid starts reading a book full of cusswords and other profanity. As long as hes reading thats all that matters to them. Even though in libraries there are kid sections that doesn't mean he can't walk over and grab an @CAPS1 book or what ever he can get his hands on.     When I was little I was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language. We even thought it was funny when ever the book had cursewords in it cause we would just repeat. I remember in school even books the teacher would read to us had cursewords and we would all laugh at it, even the teacher thought it was funny. But if we ever repeated that word while not reading it we would get sent down to the office. Even though we thought it was ok to say just because we read it out of a book.     I do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf to where a kid can grab it. I think its fine to have cursewords in books when there in junior high but elementary school is to early. Those books are meant for adults only cause some books sound better with cursewords in them. My parents thought it was wrong when I would bring home a book from the library and it would be full of cursewords or slang. But they would never say anything to the library cause they know that I will be hearing these words all the time when I get older. Those are all the reasons why I think books with curse words should not be handed out to little kids.	3	3	3
4409	2	Censorship in libraries? A yes or a No? I believe that there should not be censorship in libraries. There are not many things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in @LOCATION1. I dont see who would come up with such an abserd idea.      To me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended. @MONTH1 I remind you that we almost changed our plege to the flag of our country by getting rid of the word 'god' all because some people dont believe in god. Now we are suppose to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly?! Think about all the amazing books, movies and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or says, 'I dont think this book is apporaite for my child.' @CAPS1 about the people that do like that book and now wont be able to read it anymore all beacuse of that one person?     There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just put the naughty books in the eight-teen year or older section so younger kids dont see them. The people who want to get rid of so called dangerous books to childern make libraries sound like there porngrapic shops. Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will cause there child to be mentaly scared forever. Hell there are really that mant books out there anyways.     Now sometimes a bad book @MONTH1 end up in the kids section but that dose not mean we have to remove that book forever form all the other people who want to read that book. All librarie workers just have to make sure to put all books in there rightfull spots and nothing bad will happen. The bad books will be in the adult section and the child frendily books will be in another. Have some libabrie workers watching the area and make aure little kids dont go in the libabrie. This will prevent childern from seeing the bad books because they will be in the adult section.      In conclusion I answer this question by saying no. There are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever	3	3	3
4412	2	READ WITH @CAPS1     I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.     Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' into the adults section.     In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read. the knowledge contained within them unknown.     There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand.     With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented. Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released.	5	4	5
4431	2	Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of.  What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books?          My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it.  I think they should have a childrens section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem.  If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them.  That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that there parent wouldn't approve of or allow them read.     If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it.  Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf.  They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want there children to see it because there children would need there permission to check out the book anyways.     I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or there parents would not approve of	3	3	3
4442	2	A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book. After an hour of searching I decided on one. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out. As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material. No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experiance, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must.     Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated-@CAPS1 movie. I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music. @CAPS2 literature is not necessary and innapropriate for any age. The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations.     The world has set their standards too low, and the children of todays society are following after our footsteps. Author, Katherine Paterson once said,     '...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come.     Everyone has their own opinion and @CAPS2 is mine. As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer. I had to step-up and say something. I am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way. The first step to changing that is to set the standards high. Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves. If libraries censor materials, then next time I wnat to find the perfect book, I will.	4	3	4
4459	2	Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.    Let's take @LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.      When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.     There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.     So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it	5	4	5
4461	2	Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life.      Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? '@CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book.      However, some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. @CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life.       The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer.      Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3	4	4	4
4465	2	This writing is socially unacceptable! There are many books and media sources, that include: lauguage, sexual tones, and other immoral things and ideas. However culture does need to be obtained, although immorally on this earth is at an all-time high,we need to stop focusing on books that will always be on the sheves and turn our attention to people's hearts, and turn to morally right things.     When a person walks into a library, @CAPS8 or she can expect certain things, for example: the smell of the older books, the noise of a group of kids, and the yelling of the librarian to keep them quiet.What @CAPS8 or she would not expect is: kids doing drugs, and watching porn on the computers. This is not a book's fault or 'the evil computers' fault. This is the fault of an immoral world.     I myself have witnessed some evil things kids do in the school system and it gets worst everyday, there is good, but it certainly is not because they themselves are caring and loving about what they do on this planet. I can quote from many, in my @NUM1 grade class that have told me 'The only thing that is wrong, is telling someone they are'. This thought process is immoral. But who is going to tell them that, and what is the answer.     @CAPS2 is the answer, in the @CAPS1 it says, @CAPS2 is the way, the truth, and the life.This is truth. In the book of @CAPS3 it says, @CAPS4 gave many people over to their sinful passions. @CAPS4 is the only good, and the only light comes from @CAPS5. The only man to live a perfect life was @CAPS2 @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 was @CAPS4 in a human body. we as a planet need to turn to @CAPS5, the only good thing. And try to be like @CAPS5, because this world needs @CAPS5.     Only @CAPS4 can change a heart. We need the focus on @CAPS5, once we do that, the way we think, and the way we write, and the way we act, will change and we will not need to disgust this problem any longer	4	3	4
4481	2	Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship the people who rent or buy the items should. The @CAPS1 has an idea of what is offensive but they shouldn't be able to make that decision. If the @CAPS1 wants buisness they should try to make sure the customers are happy. Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants.     Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc. The different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all. If the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the @CAPS1 and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items. A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the @CAPS1 or people claim them to be.    Another possible solution would be to jus rearrange the area's of the books into to main category's such as offensive and none offensive, and then break it down into their specific categorys. So the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the librarys opinions and then go on from there. The surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the @CAPS1 to it's online website. The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off.     Now the @CAPS1 needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. So if the @CAPS1 feels that a book is offensive they shouldn't have the right to censorship. All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now. Think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the @CAPS1 in the first place.     So in conclusion the @CAPS1 should have know right to censorship books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have. This would cost time and money which they don't have. Customers could possibly stop comming in because of the change which would be a loss of money. Now everyone knows a big loss of money could hurt any buisness and possibley bankrupt them, or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover and no buisness wants that. So the easy way to make sure that doesn't happen jus leave everything the way it is	3	4	3
4488	2	I think that movies, and magazines should be censured to kids at the library. There are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper I am going to explain why they should be censured. I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get.      The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated @CAPS1 are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them. I mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. I mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is.      The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines. I know three in perticular off the top of my head, and they are @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't any kid, teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. This could cause them to get very sick and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die.      Well this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured. I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes. I mean there are romances but I don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance, because they are pretty boring. Well I hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get ahold of this kind of content	3	3	3
4494	2	Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea.      People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea.      As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me.      For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in. So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interrests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library	4	3	4
4498	2	Have you ever read or listened to somthing that is so disturbing that you wonder how it even got the right to be published? Well, music, books, and magazines these days are full of garbage and innapropriete thoughts that children listen to and base there life off of. All of these resources that kids can find that has this kinda of material in it can be found in libraries. We have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources.     A library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place. If a kid in school comes through the hallway saying he found a really good book, other kids become interested in it; they find out it has drugs in it and they assume that this is not a boring book like all the others that you would find in a library. Then, more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out. Now, all these children with these popular books consider themselves 'cool'. So, these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book. This leads to disaster.     Music can be the same way. Music that has been recorded in the past ten years pick up sexual references, drug usage, and innopropriete behavior in its lyrics. Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in there masterpiece? Well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies. So, every artist of any kind of work is puting these references in there books or songs. Now, singers are starting to make music videos which not along sings these lyrics but shows them as well. Children see these artist in these videos with attactive mates, lots of money, and living the 'perfect life'. So, this person try doing the same thing this artist did to make there life more like theres.      Movies come along then, movies have seen the ratings go up on these kind of styles, so they start puting them in there film. Now, all these pieces have this garbage in it and has had it in it for quite some time. How do we get it out? How do we get our children to stop getting these resources? No parents want to walk around and hear there children saying these things or doing these actions. So libraries have to have some censorship on there work; there work should be removed so minors wont get the wrong message.      What ever happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art was a special talent and was not looked up to as somthing that would get our children into some trouble? We need to get these censorships in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are	4	4	4
4501	2	When someone goes to the library, there is multiple items to choose from.  There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc.  But not all of this is nessessarilly a good thing.  There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience.  The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children sake.     Although there is much good items in a library, there is also bad or offensive items in a library as well.  For example, an explicit music album.  If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for awhile.  By taking out the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want there children listening to anyway.  Movies are also a problem in library's.  For example, library's having @CAPS1 rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch.  Most @CAPS1 rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child appropriate.  Movies that are @CAPS1 rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie.  This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch.  So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in library's, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior.  Books are the same way as movies and music.  There are books on the shelves that some people concider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book.  There are books made that include racial material in them, even deragator statements.  By taking these types of books off the shelves of library's, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur.      For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in library's should be removed.  If library's would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all library's a more healthy and stable enviornment for studying like it used to be used for.  Take out all the offensvie material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc.	4	4	4
4507	2	WE ALL DON'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DO NOT WANT YOUR CHILDREN GETTING HOLD TO THE CENSORSHIP OF BAD BOOK, MOVIE, MUSIC OR MAGAZINES. PARENT DON'T WANT TO COME HOME AN THERE CHILD LEARN A NEW WORD FROM THE NEW BOOK OR MOVIE HE/SHE JUST CHECKED OUT FROM THE LIBARY, OR READING A MAGAZINE FROM THE LIBARY. IT MIGHT MAKES YOUR CHILDREN ATTITUDE CHANGE PUTTING BAD INFLEUNCE ON YOUR KID BECAUSE OF A TRIP TO THE LIBARY. SO THERE FOR THE CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE A SECTION WHERE THEY PICK OUT THERE BOOK AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CHECK OUT THE CENSORSHIP BOOK.                                                                 WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN BE MORE CONVINCED ABOUT THIS TOPIC.	2	2	2
4517	2	The @CAPS1 on Books     In the world today, everything is showed every place you look. Libraries are used by many people, people go there to research, study, and even just to find an interesting book to read. One of the problems that some poeple are having is the exposing of personal things. I believe that libraries should have a censorship. Why should libraries have one? Here are my reasons why.     One reason why censorships in libraries are a smart idea is younger children search for books there. Any parent would tell you that they would strongly dislike the idea of their child reading something very detailed and adult like. A library should be a place where children, young adults and senior citizens can go to escape from reality not somewhere were they are worried about what book they might pull out from the shelf.      If libraries still want to keep certain books in stock, they should start an age limit on those books. Limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them. Another thing they could do with the age limiting is parents could set the age limit with the library on when their child should be allowed to view certain books.     Also, another way that would help stop offensive viewing is parents looking at what their children are reading, watching and listening to. Parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing.      Cenorships are a wonderful way of stopping the viewing of adult like issues. More public places should start a system of them. The world needs to understand that some audiences aren't ready for reality just yet	3	4	3
4520	2	Censorship          Should certain materials (books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,) be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I think it depends on how offensive the material actually is. If it is something very provacative or racist or advanced beyond the years of the people who have access to it, then it shouldn't be allowed. Or, the materials should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to. It depends on the level of intelligence, maturity, and age of the people who have access to these materials.          I don't think these materials should be removed, but restricted. Some of it should be left up to the school or library, but it is also a responsibility of the parents. If a child has permission to access a certain material, then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate. Sometimes the guardians views @MONTH1 not be the same as a the library or schools, but it's mostly up to the guardian. Schools and libraries can't really argue with people's morals or intelligence.           Over all, I don't think materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed unless it has been deemed necessary by a group of people that includes parents, teachers and/or school board memebers, and/or library staff. Just because one mom thinks a book is innapropriate for her child, doesn't mean it should be banned from another. Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what's acceptable, therefore it isn't fair for everyone to have to go by the idea of only one person.                If you don't want your child to have access to a certain material, then simply don't let them access it. If you think it's not an appropriate material for any child to access, you can express that, but others @MONTH1 not agree. Materials considered innapropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or have a warning on them, but not a ban.	4	3	4
4522	2	Im alot of things but i am surley not a reader.But i do believe that you should be able to publish anything that you want over any topic. weather that be a grafic novle or a didry maggazine. nothing should be taken off the shelf for being offencive if it offends you dont pick it up or much less read it.      Say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting, i would still be able to write it and sell it. anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it. instead why dont they just get over it? we have rights every individual person from me to you we all have them, and should be able to use them to the full exstent of what they can be used for.     Call me old fashoned but, I beleive in freedom of speach and the freedoms that we have lost solders over and the freedoms we have every single day we live. I think drinking every @DATE1 of the week is wrong but, you dont see me on the news yelling about it no i deal with it just like people should deal with the things they dont like.      so i hope in this essay ive made good points in making sacrifices and dealing with things and not act on something you shouldent be able to change, thank you for taking the time to read this.	3	3	3
4524	2	Libraries have all kinds of books. Books for everyone. I think libraries shouldn't have to take books out because some people dont like it, or find it offensive, when others might like the author.      If there is a book in the library that you find displeasin simpley don't cheak it out just put it back on the shelf and go on with your day. Like author Katherine Paterson said if we start taking book off the shelvies then there willn't be any books left to read. Yes, there are books out there that are not ment for little kids and some adults, but that's why you dont let them cheak them out till you think they are old enough. Just because you dont like the book doesn't mean noone else likes it. Everyone has there own tast in reading, as everything else.     Libraries have sections for all ages. With books for there age. Like the childern's section is for little kid, and the adult section is for adults. Little kids shouldn't be cheaking out books from the adult section. Parents should take responsibility over there kids and watch what they'r doing. Then we wouldn't have to worrie about what they are reading, watching, or listening to.     The libraries are doing just fine the way they are, and have been for years, and will for years to come. So no libraries shuold have to take sertain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it, or want there kid reading it. Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits you'r liking. People learn alot from books, so if we get rid of most of them what will we lear from then? Books are a great part of history. Why get rid of you'r history? It's just wrong. Books shouold stay right where they are and belong.	3	4	3
4530	2	I think that this kaind of books they maybe sometimes offend to some people that depending of what kaind or type of book, magazine, movie, music don't want to see there and agree and not agree on this because they are some some type of thinks that are not bad for kids like games for they age or music that are appropiate for there age and others like animals, cultures and all that thinks but that only think that I am not agree is that they can not be books, music, magazines, or even movies that have sexual arrasment that type of stuff not go into a library I think that that type of stuff can be dangueres or affencive for some parents and people that have or don't have kids and I think if they are in some libraries that I agree that they need to take that off because I don't want or people want that kids be disrespecfull and learn that type of thinks that they don't go with there educasion and with there age. I desagree too that this type of music that some artist are meading that they are tooking about drugs, gongs and narcotrafic and even sex and I know this because sometimes I heer this on the @CAPS1 and radio that they are sining and this influence to kids to have another directions on their life and us like parents we don't want that for our kids, don't want that fro their future, we want that they have a good future and be succefull and give them the same example to their kids to went they wrog up and  be a parent to and they are going to see what we are tooking about.I been seen it and parts of the world people been kill or people killing at other inocent persons for this type of things more for drugs that they are saling drugs and they are doing money that they are hurting to other people or kids that consume this drugs that maybe can be our kids or some friends kid and sometimes if they don't pay that money that they need to pay they kill them or that police are traying to faind them because are doing bad thinks and I hope that artist, or people that put this on the libraries think firts that maybe they are doing something wrong of steff that are thinking that are doing something good	3	3	3
4537	2	Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media	4	4	4
4542	2	Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what.     I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series becasue she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read.     In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children.     I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight year old should not be able to go in and get a @NUM1 movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the @NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment.    Libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article.     So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read.	4	4	4
4546	2	Censorship is a matter of great contention today. Many authority figures have seemingly become obsessed with the notion that literature, video games, movies, and music are responsible for the perceived corruption of today's generation. Many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright. However, I believe censorship is a grand mistake on our part. Denying children access to certain literary works only keeps them ignorant, not innocent; so many books today are censored, and yet the information contained in them could have been vital to children who are seeking an understanding of the world they live in.     One of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not. Books that are viewed as offensive or controversial are the usual targets, but viewing something as being offensive is just thata view. It changes from person to person because of varying cultures, religions, and moral codes. No one can agree on what will have a negative impact on children, making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best left off the shelf. The problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable.     Censorship can protect a child from information they are better off not knowing, but it also robs them of a chance to gain vital knowledge. Children should be encouraged to read and to learn, not blocked from doing so. Yet if this is truly the case, why does the censorship debate still rage?     The argument continues because, in truth, there really are things that ought to be censored. Movies, music, and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature, and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths. Bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children. But that cannot be the sole cause of such behavior; children will act right if they are taught how, not if they are hidden away from every instance of wrong. Censorship is greatly inferior to proper life lessons about morality, equality, peace, and respect.     Inevitably, censorship will remain a common practice. But try this: think of a book that changed your life for the better, and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it. Do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them?	5	5	5
4580	2	Yes, I do think so because everyone has an opinon to say and its something people like to look at or leason to. Now it would be diffeint if it was a childerins book store like if they have music like christin bible songs or desine movies in the store but not to have grown-up stuff.     I really do not see the big deal if they are out because everyone likes reading somthing differint. I think as long as your reading whats it matter what it is or as long as your learning something.      I do not think u can get stuff out like movies and magazines because people like to read them to much or leason to music. So it shoukld not really matter what or where they go if you ask me	2	2	2
4590	2	I say tht they shouldn't take off books that are found affensive and im going to say why I think that.I think that they shouldn't take off those books because thats the way it was written, and if the person that finds that book offensive then just don't read it.Another reason they shouldn't take it off its because a author wrote it but im sure that he didn't think that a person was goin to find it offensive.My third reason they shouldn't take it off the shelf its because the book might be really good and interesting, except for tht one person that thinks its offensive.I just told y'all why I think they shouldn't take the book off the shelf just because one person says so.	2	3	2
4601	2	Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to.  It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it	3	3	3
4627	2	I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read.     If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books.     There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay.     Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all.     The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw.      In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed	3	3	3
4638	2	In the book fahernheit @NUM1 all books get burned no matter what they contain and the people are always sad and depressed about everything. Books are an improtnat part of our lives. Some materials do need to be cencored because it might offend some people that are all ready have a hard time with being who they are without these things to add to the flame. Their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason. There might be a rude or a miss understood word that caused books to be unnessisary cencored. Cencorship is important to libraries when used correctly.     We need books for many things from learning to simply use up time. Music has been with mankind since the beginning. Movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines inform us on what new and interesting. These things have become imprtant to us as clothes and food. Simply taking these out will make the world will make it a darker palce to live.      Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me then everyone can too and soon all of the bookes will be gone .. We can try to be nice to every one, but somepoint something will insult someone no matter what we do or say. Do we need to get rid of everything for that reason?	2	2	2
4644	2	Libraries are normally a safe quiet place for people to go set down drink a cup of coffee and read a book/magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of there favorite music.  But, some people don't use it as that.  They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people that are trying to have some time just to them selves while there children are away or had a bad day and to regroup and get ready for the next day. But then we ask our selves why do people want to set at a library and read.  Why can't they just check out a book, cd, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library?     I don't see what the big deal is to this! Most counties have a public libarary.  That is meaning they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at there stuff.  Yes, I can see libraries making the person checking out a book sign a letter or document, giving personal information as in a telephone number, address, or credit card number.  The letter would be saying that they have this much time with this book and they needed it back on a certain date or else they need to bring it back in a get it renewed so they can't accuse of anyone stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer.  Most places have what they call late fees.  Normally, if someone has a late fee then you aren't going to get that book back because they don't want to pay it so I feel as if giving them a credit card number they can just keep charging there account and get the money that way for the late fees. Because they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they recieve in the mail from the libabry in the trash.      I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never ending process with certain people because some of them just don't care.     Yes, the internet would be a little diffrent because not everyone has money to get the internet at there house.      I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junkey.  My ideas to me are good ideas and I feel like we can put Libraries into good use around this county and @LOCATION1	2	3	2
4655	2	Do I believe that certain materials, suchs as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive? No I do not. My opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good. Most of it is very helpful information. Some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them, but most of it is history. You can't change that. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magaine, they shouldn't read it.     I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects. If we need to know about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library. Some peoples views on that is totally different, but hey. We can't help what people did in the past. We can only learn from their mistakes. I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it. Look for something else more interesting to you.      I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me. Or even bad. They have books over everything. Some of it can be bad, but mostly it all is good information. They talk about history, and guns and drugs, and wars and all sorts of other history information. There are books over stuff that isn't even true.     I think people @MONTH1 over react on some things. If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it. Look at the cover and if it seems appealing, get it. But if not, don't waste time on complaining about it. Because then things can get out of control.      That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc in our libraries. Mainly they seem very helpful, but others can have different opinions	4	3	4
4689	2	Look it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a...harmful word. There has been many times when i have read a passage wether it be a magazine article, a book or a newspaper and I have come across harmful words. They @MONTH1 not all mean harm towards me but towards other readers they could. People have their own opinnions on different views, so a word or passage could effect me differently then say smeone else.     I don't think it's the materials I think it's the readers maturity level that makes a difference. That is how harmful words get changed into names and then the next thing peers are calling other peers that word. For instnce the word 'wetback' in biography book about the @CAPS1 it is okay to be there, it is when the reader inturperates it the wrong way, and they think it is funny, and cool to go around and call someone that word, especially a person of that race.     That is when I dont think materials like this should be on shelves, but then again it goes back to the maturity level. These words or passages can become harmful to someone that hasn't even read it, but because someone that has took the iniciative to start calling someone that word, or relating that passage to them.      Books can, and are a great reliable source for schoolers that are researching for class projects, i think it's the certain topics of books that's get these words turned into harm. Books about certain races can cause name calling among a school just because they read it in a book and think it is okay, because the book described a person that way doesn't mean it's okay for the reader to start calling people by that word.      Other topics like 'sex' in a book can be inturperated in the wrong way as well. Some teens think it's okay just because the characters in the book are doing it then it's okay for them and their significant other to try it.     Either way with the book left on the shelf or taken off it is still going to be a problem with name calling. So it's going to take something else then a materials being removed from a shelf to find a solution to this problem	4	4	4
4708	2	Censorship      @CAPS1 you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, magizine, you @MONTH1 come across some interesting ones. Should libraries ban certain books just because of some contend on one page? The person has that ability to read that book or not.      Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped. People should be old enough to choose a book that they enjoy and not have to worry about, does this libary have the book that I want. They should not have to think that way @CAPS1 going to a library. @CAPS1 you think of some of the worst books out there, who would want to read those anyway. Many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page. They do not think that they are banning a perfectly good book for others. @PERSON2's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' was a big upror wheather or not to put the book on the shelfs. The book intailed the @CAPS4 word, and some people were not pleased in this sequence. The book was very well written and just had a few bad words. Should a few bad words keep a book from being a prize winner. The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes.      There are many ways to keep a certain age from gettting a certain book. The library could put those certain books in @CAPS5 own part of the library. Keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a better suited way instead of banning the books altogether. The book still will be censored to be in that section or not, but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much. What if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it. That book contained bad language, should the health and knowledge of the world go down because of some bad material in a book, that could help us in the near future.      Authors have just the same right as we do. They should get a say in wheather @CAPS5 own book is liable to be on the shelfs. The government should not get all the say in this series matter in hand. The community and the author that writes it should get more of the say then anyone else. @CAPS1 an author writes a novel they think of the great content they are putting into this great piece of art not thinking of, is this suitable for children to read. The author just loves to write and should not have to think of all the concerns that they should just not worry about.      There is this book we read this year called '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 Are @CAPS7 @CAPS8'. This book had language that I do not think would be suitable for others in some content that was in the novel. Now do I think the the novel should be banned from a library? No, because it used the words in a very nonviolent way. @CAPS1 reading it I felt that I was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates. @PERSON1 was the author of this book and I thought she did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature. So the next time you think of banning a book think of all the warm hearts you could be crushing	5	4	5
4715	2	Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library.  In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left.  The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question.  There is a simple answer to this question.  It should not be censored.     Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize.  The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries.  As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books.     To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works.  Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues.  These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately.       The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with.  This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored.  The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line.  Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages?  In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got inpregnated within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind.  Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible.     Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left.  This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone.  As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist.  It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgement the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad.'	4	4	4
4719	2	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3.      Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. @CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do.     Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book.      If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring. Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials.     In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, @CAPS3's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from @CAPS3. Do you really want our society to prohibit intelectual thinking just because they think certain material @MONTH1 be offensive? Think about @CAPS3	5	5	5
4732	2	Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more sensorship in libraries but we can not always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You @MONTH1 never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just sensor them.      Censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book.                    People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves.      Instead of banning the books or complaining about it them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it.     You @MONTH1 not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure	4	4	4
4740	2	What @CAPS1 You Do?     A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. Let the libraries be!	4	4	4
4745	2	'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive.  First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive	3	3	3
4750	2	There should not be sensorship on the books in the library just think of how many great pieces of literature out there that no one would be able to get there hands because they didn't reach your standards. People wouldn't be able to reads some of their favor right books. Would you really want to take that from the people? If my arguement did' change your mind you copuld atleast put the sensored books behind the counter.	2	2	2
4752	2	Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inapropiate.  I believe that libraries should not have censorship.      I personally, think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power. If it is a library were there's always smaller children their, then I think they could have the power of censorship. In conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropiate for there son or daughter.     Now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship. First in for most, because its your choice of the item, if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it, watch it or listen to it.     Second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive. Also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period.      Last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians. So many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left.     In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf. There for, I believe cencorship is not need in libraries.	4	4	4
4758	2	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't think so, these items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages. If you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want. If you are under the age of eighteen there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent.      For those under eighteen when they get a library membership they should have to verify thier date of birth, and what thier parent srequest their child to be able to read, play, or watch. Librarys and book stores should put a rating on the magazines or books, just like movies. This will promote less parents of anger for thier children listening to music or reading inappropriate books, magazines, or video games. Now if books stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent, there can be charges pressed. It would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor, or cigarettes to a minor.     From my observations with my little brother, my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games. For instance these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. In result of this I notice that my brother does not obey, or treat my mother with the respect as he should. He also misbehaves in school constantly. That is just one example of the many I know of.     Even if the parent gives permission for thier child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for his/her age, they should still have to be a certain age. Some parents make poor decisions on thier parenting, and it will reflect them later in life.     So my overall opinion would be no. Keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch, read, or play. If they limit the selling of these items to minors, these children @DATE1 will not have as many crimes all together. There would be less violence, and drug offenses or abuse. Keep this all in mind.                                                                 @ORGANIZATION1	4	4	4
4761	2	Offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on. Things in magazines shoud be appropriate for people to see. The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the @ORGANIZATION1 or the @CAPS1 of your state.      If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves. If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything.     What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway.Even though movies are kind of different. Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with. So if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with.      Offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it. It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know.For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president. @PERSON1 was being question about his birth certificate. People did not believe that he was born in @LOCATION1.      I personally think he was in fact born in the @CAPS2.S . But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotton. It was uncalled for to begin with.     I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president.	3	3	3
4774	2	I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually. Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know.      People are not going to look at things the same. Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently. If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us. No more books, music, movies, and magazines.     Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are. American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind. So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer	3	3	3
4775	2	Yes we should keep the books,music,movies,an magazines.     The magazines an music might not be a good thing for some us for must people use music to consutrate on doing work an magazines help us on getting topics for class work. why would some one take books or any thing that help us in life, so the person who wants to take book away should live the books or anything eles alone. So to this yes we should keep the books,music,movies, an magazines on the shelfs. We need to start fighting for what we want an how we want it should not be know ones eles chioc to deside what is good for us.	2	2	2
5986	3	The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard.	2	2	2
5993	3	In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because of he sees the same setting (the dessert) for several miles, he has no water and, the road has a lot of hills. The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint.	1	2	2
6016	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren’t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men’s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story.	3	2	3
6024	3	In the story of “rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit” the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so mainly it is the old guys thought he dies. The cyclist survives but the heat and the season he was riding he’ll probably bring another water botlle nextime	1	1	1
6040	3	In the essay ‘ Rough Road Ahead Do Not exede posted speed him if many of the featutres of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist goes by river wich he wount find later in the journey.As he goes along in the journey the heat and lack of water starts to affect him. Also he finds a water fountain that pours hot water with the flavor that has long since been shut down. The cyclist is affected by many features of the setting.	1	1	1
6044	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up. 	1	2	2
6056	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author’s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid.	1	1	1
6083	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably.	1	1	1
6125	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one, the conditions of the road were awful. Two, the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path as well as the occasional tumble weed. The biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired. Those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist.	2	2	2
6132	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3	3	3
6133	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn’t have much water to drink.	1	1	1
6156	3	The feature’s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.”  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  	2	2	2
6159	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years.	2	2	2
6176	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when the old guy had told him do you know where to go? An the other guy was like “ yes sir! I own a very good map” so how did it change for the man that was riding this bike he saw all of those towns an a sign that said Rough Road ahead. That the man would always stick to the future. What had change was he saw all of those buildings, town, an he was going an going. I think he might stick with the future.	1	1	1
6184	3	In the story “Rough road ahead” the setting affect’s the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by lack of water, the distance he has to travel, and the hilly terrain. “The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” this statement shows how he was out of water and was tired and hot. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in the story.	1	1	1
6185	3	The cyclist has it hard in the conditions lack of water, heat and rough terrain are all things that made his ride harder. First, the lack of water took a tole on the amount of energy he had to keep going. Secont the heat also affected his trip It mad it hard for him to Keep going he thought he would die. And the birds would bick at his dead body. Last the Terrain didn’t help. The trip had many hills and that used alot of energy so I made it harder. In conclusion those are things that worked against th cyclist.	2	2	2
6196	3	The ways that can effects the cyclist by the setting of the place are how the road is shaped or the riding up the hills and the roughness of the rode. There were an sign where it said “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.” That sign if he didn’t see it he would have over the speed or didn’t know what the speed he was to go as a cyclist and gotten hurt. The road was made for the cars so the speed limit is hard to	1	1	1
6197	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. I this setting he used up his water and it was hot. this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this when it said “I could drop from heat stroke”, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirsty er. This also made him dis apointed. The finale setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasn’t thirsty. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
6201	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says “the sun was beating on me” this shows it was hot. Thats one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated.	1	2	2
6205	3	The story “Do not exceed posted speed limit is about a cyclist who got bad direction to Yosemite National Park and has a depleeding water supply is extreme heat. He is doubtful that he will make is journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy.	2	2	2
6207	3	the way I would set my affected cyclist is by him riding throught. Something u would never thing he can set thought then over coming his intention.	0	0	0
6213	3	The setting affect the cyclist features because if the cyclist was riding in @LOCATION1 around june the affect @MONTH1 not had been that harsh. But overall the setting out begin in a hot place with limited water was not a good thing. That’s how the cyclist is affected by the setting.	1	1	1
6215	3	The cyclist in the article almost died from dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his misadventure in a light hearted, humourous way. I commend him for almost dying and laughing about it and then turning around and blaming it on old people. He is an inspiration for reckless young folk. Oh yeah, and the setting was a desert.	1	1	1
6223	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven’t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn’t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn’t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his “dehydrated state.” I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn’t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn’t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2	3
6241	3	This story was a great motivation for older man that can still be healthy and feel like an teenager again. It showed how much effort he put to his goal and how he survive. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink same water the cyclist was and interesting story not ginaupup	1	1	1
6243	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.	2	2	2
6250	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how “I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was parably assurance even thing would be fine. Confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out “this breezy jaunt.” The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I notices the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings @MONTH1 have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist suceeded. "	2	3	3
6255	3	The features of the setting greatly effect he cyclist one way it effects him is because it is so hot and he doesn’t here any water left. Also because their are so many almost buildingc and ghost towns this gives him cables haze that he will be able get the water.	1	1	1
6262	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.   "	3	2	3
6281	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1	1
6284	3	After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3	3	3
6287	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting often affects the character. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me”. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy. These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination."	3	2	3
6290	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1	1
6291	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn’t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.	2	2	2
6300	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, “I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, “Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I’d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.	3	3	3
6308	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says “wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.” The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.	3	3	3
6329	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time. He was also was determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, that also makes him relived, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2	2
6343	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn’t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1° degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2° degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in “No @CAPS2’s @CAPS3”. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels.	1	1	1
6348	3	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1, which ear him, quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. Behind these aspects make the use frol final much inorder  for the cyclist and gives the reader image as what he is going through.	1	1	1
6356	3	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY.	1	1	1
6361	3	Durring the cyclist @CAPS1 he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.” This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his @CAPS2. 	2	2	2
6369	3	The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The heat wears him down. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey. These things make him week and makes it harder for him to find a place to get water.	1	1	1
6385	3	The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn’t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist “as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.	1	2	2
6386	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “ From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2	2
6388	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.	3	2	3
6389	3	The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This could also cause a problem because he can’t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can’t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day.	2	2	2
6396	3	When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the “old timers” he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  	3	3	3
6403	3	I think it explains because they did good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did same thing worng to.	0	0	0
6429	3	Don’t let anything stop you with your goals. Going to Yosemite National Park. Takes a status that would out home off side. Forty miles into the trys comes to a town. Got to a water station and get nothing because old men say “the water taste like buttery acid. Lead going to hills and azyl towns, @CAPS1 can be rod without anything to drink. People die  from heatatacks because they don’t  sits and take herats for water and food.	1	1	1
6462	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn’t look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.	3	3	3
6473	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6481	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.	1	1	1
6493	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,” At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.	2	2	2
6497	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, “I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).” This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says “I toiled on( @CAPS2).” This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure.	2	2	2
6500	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1	2
6510	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.	2	1	2
6520	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are “cool pines and rushing rivers,” however, the cyclist comes to find that the “rushing river” is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he’d be better off using his map.	2	1	2
6522	3	Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because, there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine.	2	2	2
6536	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. If you arn’t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.	2	2	2
6550	3	The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.	1	1	1
6564	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don’t think it does. Expecially for cyclist traveling anywhere or everywhere. In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you’re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these “town” they had no water, because they weren’t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don’t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.” l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist” This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he’d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.  	3	3	3
6576	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2	2
6577	3	"The features of the setting have a large affect on the cyclist. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow do keep from dehydration. If the cyclist in,”Do Not Exceed Posted  Speed Limit"", was cycling in winter time, he would of been so thirsty all of the time. Also if the whole ride was down hill, he would be so tired,"	1	1	1
6580	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn’t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.	2	2	2
6582	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2	2
6616	3	The story is basically talking about more people with cars should ride bicycles to work or to school’s so it want be alot of polution in the air.	0	0	0
6625	3	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.    	2	1	2
6633	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   "	3	3	3
6635	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.	2	2	2
6637	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen’t find water.	2	3	3
6657	3	"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in. "	3	3	3
6671	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” By Joe Kurmaskie the settings affected the cyclist by how hard his ride is. When the road was smooth He ride was fast when it was the hills it took him longer to get to the next town.	1	1	1
6691	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it’s raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if it’s very hot outside you wouldn’t see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldn’t be able to finish any race.	1	1	1
6692	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can’t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he’s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn’t really know where he was going because there wasn’t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first “town” as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he’s only 12 he knows that he’s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2	2
6736	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The “towns” he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn’t get more water or a place to rest. “I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel”. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.	2	2	2
6755	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … “(Kurmaskie).	3	2	3
6765	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist’s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist’s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2	3	3
6766	3	The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was “going to drop from heat exsostion”, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old “gentlemen” sitting on a porch.	1	1	1
6768	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily.	1	1	1
6814	3	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were.	2	2	2
6821	3	When the cycleist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that it’s hot because he is swreating and dehydrated.	1	1	1
6822	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he’s fine. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” he knows that things are going to get rough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph”. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn’t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more threatening too, “a ridiculously large shake.” The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3	3
6825	3	Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don’t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.	3	1	3
6834	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is poisonous snake out thre. Your the only person ridin dow those hills all by your self. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. The lack of water that there were not any streams or rivers around there just in a desert with nothing.	1	1	1
6841	3	The features of the setting include “There are no one in sights, not a building, car, or structure of any kind which describes the trail the cyclist was taking. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his doubting whetther he will survive or not.	1	1	1
6848	3	this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first “town”. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time”. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone.	2	2	2
6855	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.	2	2	2
6858	3	During the authors ride to Yosemite, he doesn’t have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like “Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat.	2	3	3
6865	3	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journy. One of them was he hills the it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down. The other one was water, the lack of water. If the had enerf water he would have gotten a boost that would have kept him going.	2	1	2
6870	3	Hot, alone, no water – all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6873	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn’t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated.	2	2	2
6880	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This affects him because cant get water from the well. So this means he needs water, but cannot get water. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder to hot reek. So all this puts affect on him from just whats around him. The old abbandon factory with the boy drinking juice was had the  most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to give up. In this essay the setting had alot of affect on the cyclist to were he thought he might die."	2	2	2
6884	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, expecially if you’ve been riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive.	2	2	2
6920	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through as desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat rode and dirt. He is riding on the road; hopelssly hoping for some form of lif. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “The author is trying to be positive but it’s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn’t be that worried, there’s water and shade. He has none of that in the desert. This whole journey was all mental. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok. That is what helped him survive. This is an ispiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stey optionistic.	2	2	2
6931	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3	3
6937	3	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting.	2	2	2
6943	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist.	1	1	1
6965	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted”. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill”. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile”	3	2	3
6970	3	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” this shows that he had no energy left.	2	2	2
6980	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.	1	1	1
6998	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared.	1	1	1
7005	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1	1
7016	3	"The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it’s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he’s lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed."	1	1	1
7019	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	1	2	2
7024	3	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     	0	0	0
7026	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June” this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.	2	3	3
7040	3	The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit” affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.” The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large” snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn’t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3	3	3
7044	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him.	1	1	1
7058	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1	1
7059	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in “high desert of California in June.” This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3	3
7061	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh turane proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned leaving him no refill. The heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired. On the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting set the conflict and helped achive the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
7062	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1	1
7068	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1	2
7070	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1	1
7087	3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn’t take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map.	3	2	3
7089	3	"People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, thus a very true. His first mistake was when he took directions from the “old-timers” by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch. He said, “what I shouldn’t have done was to let them see my map"".  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, “The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn’t anybody around to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind.” By reading this story, we’ve realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however any problem, no matter what size, can be overcomed"	1	1	1
7096	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.	2	2	2
7114	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. One feature that affected the character was the heat of the sun. The narration states” The sun was beginning to beat down” (@CAPS1).	1	1	1
7117	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. There are no rivers in the that desert so he couldn’t get water. It is so hot out there that he couldn’t see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes. Also there are no people out there because of how hot it is.	1	1	1
7128	3	The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways.	1	2	2
7140	3	The features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers of doing it. He took advice from old people to do it. But even though it started out good almost nothing last forever. Hes riding a like in the middle of summer with little water and in the desert. He runs into towns that are abandon and the next town is only @NUM1 miles are litheraly going to be rough roads ahead. But when he did get to the town that was abandon to. until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair 	2	2	2
7157	3	The setting of the cyclist’s journey effected him because if he was a tot desert in california. This effected him because he had to ride a bike throug it and he heat took a lot out of him. He didn’t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply because of the desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.	2	2	2
7161	3	 The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they doubt or lessen his chances for survival, but the cyclist is determined so he survives.	3	2	3
7166	3	The features of the setting inhance the cyclist’s desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant” which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.	2	2	2
7172	3	In the story rough road ahead the cyclest is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist	2	2	2
7176	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story.	1	1	1
7178	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,” this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist.	1	1	1
7180	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drink and sweating water so he is really work down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter.	1	1	1
7199	3	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.	1	1	1
7206	3	Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 that California is called, “the sunshine state”, I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
7211	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn’t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn’t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn’t see anything in sight.	3	3	3
7215	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay she was happy that she was getting a shortcut ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” He thought he knew where he was going “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, “this sight was troubling”. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, “she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was “only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehightrated state. “ The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, “Gary and wilbers fish camp”. He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys."	2	2	2
7217	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclcist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park.	3	3	3
7233	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist most on the fact that it strained him out the hydrated state. It made him unable to operate at his full power/efficiency. It deprived him of the little energy he had in him to begin with. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1	1
7264	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	1	1	1
7283	3	Throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. If the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.	1	1	1
7291	3	"The setting in “Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake “a ridiculously large"" snake – it realy didn’t look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me “(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."	2	2	2
7297	3	In the short story “Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many changes in temperature and climate. He also experiences changes in land structure which makes it extremely hard to pedal and get where he needs to. From my reasoning is why the setting @MONTH1 affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7302	3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states “This sight was troubleing,” He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water”. Also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. He	3	3	3
7303	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, “ The  sun was beginning to beat down , “ (Kurmaskie) .He is starting to get tired ‘because ‘ it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June “. (Kurmaskie).Not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 	2	2	2
7320	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn’t have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn’t able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
7321	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day….” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The sertting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cycleist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much.	2	2	2
7325	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills is wearing him out. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off.	1	1	1
7352	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid,” that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey."	2	2	2
7353	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, “...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 it was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, “the sun was beginning to beatdown...” @CAPS1 it is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, “...it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He might have died from dehydration. “I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out.” There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist. @CAPS1, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty.	2	2	2
7363	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals	1	1	1
7368	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to discribe the setting like “flat road” and “short, rolling hills”, There were also more example. The way the cyclist discribed the setting gave the reader a visual picture. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting.	1	1	1
7373	3	"The cyclist a had rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says,""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. ""This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirster. ""@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. ""It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This show you now rough the conditions were because he told us in the begining that he is a cyclist. The biker hell a very rough time and the setting definity effects this. "	2	3	3
7377	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts don’t have much water which is what he needed and he couldn’t find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him.	2	2	2
7386	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are. The hills that the cyclisit has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat alot so he is loosing fluids and he starts to got dyhydrated. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired.	1	1	1
7404	3	In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   	2	2	2
7412	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn’t any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes - The fact that he wos running out of water- the hill-and the condition of the road.	2	2	2
7414	3	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!	1	1	1
7420	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn’t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He didn’t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride.	3	3	3
7425	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his enduranc. The amount of time he can ride without stopping, houever long he can ride up hill, how ever many bumps he rides over, however long he can ride without a drink of water.	1	1	1
7429	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilema.”… @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. Blocked the… pavement in front of me.” He had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that “really did look like a diamondback.” @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it’s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.” I’d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of 	3	2	3
7440	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it.	2	2	2
7478	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he “enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening”. The word “serenity” gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the “ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule” in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating “Rough Road Ahead”. Kurmaskie’s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a “rather modern bathroom” where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie’s confidence is followed by determination and then relief.	3	3	3
7481	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says “There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.	1	1	1
7491	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discoured the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this “town” he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and and sweaty. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke...” The cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he’s talked to the old men for directions he hasn’t seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. So this definetly discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. 	3	3	3
7499	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very hot in dry, very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This whether affected the author because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went."	1	1	1
7502	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view”. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. Also it says in the story “I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3	3	3
7531	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."	1	1	1
7536	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. The description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn’t know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.	1	1	1
7558	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.	2	1	2
7565	3	It is very difficult to be outside in heat, let alone advise from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 out sides, you don’t need to be out there. Doesn,t matter how long you are outside for, a heatstroke could come at any body fast than they can count to @NUM2.	1	1	1
7575	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid.” The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1’s Juice factory. The text says,‘a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth.” These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."	2	3	3
7582	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on.	2	2	2
7586	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the ‘towns’ around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. 	2	1	2
7605	3	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town but then the rest of time towns are abandoned too and start to ran out of water an he thinks he is going to die which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.	2	3	3
7610	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting. The cyclists has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. Soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out a man is sittiNg on the porch. The author gets directios from him and is happy that he is on the right track again.	1	2	2
7617	3	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cycalist is taking it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get enjoyable quickly. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is rode, sand and an empty factory, your moral can easily dray quickly. It’s just an overall way setting to give lost in.	1	1	1
7619	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, “This sight was troubling…I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.” With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called “easy way out.” 	1	1	1
7627	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit” this many different settings took its toll on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying.	1	1	1
7629	3	One feature that effected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The  “text states “ two miles into the section... I noticed  the terrain changing…	1	1	1
7662	3	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally.	2	2	2
7696	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one lesson the cyclist learned was to never to listen to short-cuts given to you by old men who are extremly out of date and haven’t left their pourch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. One his journey the cyclist says “…I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated. Also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills. The feature of the setting effects the cyclist by tiring him out and making him believe there isn’t any hope of him getting out alive. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates a	2	2	2
7704	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  	2	2	2
8865	4	The author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains: @CAPS1 attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress importance in the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.	3	2	3
8868	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about about when saeng will take the test again. The author told the time with the season of the spring. In spring all the snows were melted and the geese and hibiscus has budding. And this paragraped make the reader to understand easyer. This is why the author include this paragraph in the story. 	1	1	1
8891	4	By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says” when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,”she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. 	3	3	3
8898	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show just cause saeng failed that test don’t mean she giving up. she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. what the author means that right now she has failed but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to re take it. And by the time she ready to take the test the snow with have went away every should be hot out the birds come back and the flower is growing fine. she  will take it. And how author ended it lets us know she going to take it but how he use the words let us know that she will not only take it but pass it too.	2	1	2
8935	4	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, @PERSON1 talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew, when saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says,”I will take the test again,” it shows that Saeng is willing try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping trditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like.	2	2	2
8966	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph because he knows all of this stuff going on will probley def come back up again. Just like how he said the geese, will geese  come back every year, so he is def saying that off of this will com back up. That is what I think.	1	1	1
8981	4	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life.   	3	3	3
8992	4	the Author concluded the story with this paragraph because @CAPS1 was try intoto let us know what happen after the story was done. and tryed to make it clear and that’s why I think that @CAPS1 came up with that idea to conclude with that paragraph.	0	0	0
8995	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow…” to show that Saeng got stronger. She got, stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesn’t want to cry again, like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger.	2	2	2
9004	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won’t give up. “Saeng  vowed silently to herself, “I will take that test again”, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.	2	3	3
9007	4	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng’s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, ”When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, “it’s not like the kind we had before.” But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  	2	2	2
9012	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently because she is thinking about what had happen a long time ago with her mom, the plants in her garden. Saeng was thinking about when everything comes back how will it be with the return of Spring, when the snow melts how will things be, the geese retorning and she will take the test again, that is what She was vowed silently to herself about. That is how i thik the author will conclude the story with this paragraph included wit it.	1	1	1
9019	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s determination to adapt to the change in her life. In the story saeng fails her drivers test and is struggling to adapt to her new life in @LOCATION1. However, when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she is determined to adopt as well. Saeng buys a hibiscus because it reminds her of home. This not only comforts her it also makes her miss her old home more. The hibiscus can survive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, so it helps saeng realize that she can as well. The author includes the geese because they help saeng realize that she is becaming more familiar with things in the United states, so she can continue to adapt. Saeng says that she now recognizes the “V” shape of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more accostomed to @LOCATION1 and she is able to survive helps her reach the determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change.	3	3	3
9034	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. “This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded.	2	2	2
9037	4	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes his story with an odd ending. “’when they come back,’ Saeng vowed silently to herself,’in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.’” I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver’s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..” I believe that this is showing that she still didn’t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       	3	3	3
9048	4	The author ends the story this way to show that there can always be a happy ending. The geese came back  and the girl was happ because of  it.	0	0	0
9049	4	The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes.	1	2	2
9057	4	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.	1	2	2
9061	4	The author choose this end to show that saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then. She had taken the test and failed, living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted throughly she will try her best to surcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. I,”I-I failed the test,” Saeng said. For a long moment mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits.”it anger Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge extreme emotiona situations occur. Saeng just needed hope and the author choose this to betray to then reader there is a chance of hope!	3	3	3
9063	4	The auther cncludes the story with this paragraph because it wraps it all up and sums it into one. It is explaining that she is looking forward to the spring when the hibiscuss is	1	1	1
9074	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. While reading you will find that Saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. In the story the author writes, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.” The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her. She then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once “this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test again” because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move. It is giving her motivation to once again take the driver’s test, and it is also letting the reader know that Saeng is not giving up.	3	2	3
9075	4	Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a strong paragraph to show the passion and will of Saeng in her new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences states that Saeng “vowed” to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight. This will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. Saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test. “Winter Hibiscus” is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life. By closing the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho puts a happy ending to a possibly sad tale.	3	2	3
9080	4	"The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincearl, ""Saeng"" was to the hibiscus flower. I say this because through out the story @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. I think she felt as through she could relate to the flower."	1	1	1
9082	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country.	2	2	2
9091	4	In “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isn’t giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. “Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.” This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level.	2	1	2
9128	4	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."	1	1	1
9149	4	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  	2	2	2
9150	4	Why the author concludes it because the author wants to show her that she won’t give up. that she will take the test again and try harder next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to show her, that she’s not a quitter, and she’s filled with determination even though she has conflicts.	1	1	1
9151	4	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? I believe that the author concluded that paragraph because it tells what she is going to do in the future. For example in the story she told her mom “I failed…” When she was putting the flower in the hole by the garden a flock of geese were flying, heading south.	1	1	1
9161	4	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.	3	3	3
9175	4	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling deafeted and worthless. Her mother took into concideration and didn’t get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng’s mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her drivers test again, and ultimatly live with the same attitude her mother has.    	3	2	3
9188	4	The author concludes the story with, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. It’s almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant budds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase.	2	3	3
9190	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, author ends the story with “When they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that Saeng is ready to adapt, but still needs time. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with overcoming moving from her home, to an unfamiliar place hundreds of miles away. However, Saeng still isn’t ready to let go of her home yet. So she tries to hang on to her old memories, only to that in @LOCATION1, everything is different. When she buys a familiar plant to her, she realizes that even it is different in @LOCATION1, and gets angry that nit isn’t what she expected. However, at the end of the story she realizes that different isn’t always so bad, and vows to try to accept this new culture, but nows that it will still take a long time before she is ready to fully do so.	3	2	3
9210	4	I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.	1	1	1
9225	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	1	1	1
9236	4	"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again” because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng."	2	2	2
9259	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn’t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.	2	2	2
9268	4	The reason why he concludes this with this paragraph is because he is telling how the story ends. The reason behind that is so people know's what happens.	0	0	0
9271	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she adapted her  new home. Also, it concludes the story so it shows the leader her last thoughts. So its like its, the  last thing , and subject  that  you  that  you  think  the author  concludes  the  story with  this  paragraph ,” when  they  come  back , in the spring , when the snows melt and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus is budding , then  I  will  take that  test  again.”	1	1	1
9276	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows plants die and won’t grow back until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will she how her garden will be in the spring. Therefore the author put this paragraph in the end because Saeng loves gardening so much ever since she moved to the United States. Ever since the family moved to the United States the family has never been happier for being together having dinner and planting together they had the time of there life planting all the time.	1	1	1
9285	4	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved	2	2	2
9302	4	“When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself .in the spring ,when the snow melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again “.So which mean when they come back she has to make a test up ,so they don’t have to worry about it later.But  on there trip they seen a lot of different thing ,the soil was cold and hard they couldn’t much with it.She though it was walking into another world ,hot, moist world exploding with with greenery @CAPS1  frends and ones of shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion .And beside it was yet another old  friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and the dainty flower with the purplish petals and white centers .It was already dusk when Saeng reach home ,the wind was blowing hard tearing off last remants of green in the chicory weeds that grew thre the crack of the sidwak .So @CAPS2 to they saw a lot of thing on their trip.So saw thing  they never  seen before like the wed growin therw the sidewalk.	1	0	1
9334	4	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more intrested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year. 	1	1	1
9336	4	The auther ends the story in this way because it represents the new brith that will take place. It’s almost as if she’s saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng “realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through queit repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she’ll have a different outlook on her new life.	2	2	2
9367	4	The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with message of hope. After saeng failed the test “in the maint shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,” it’s inspiring to know that she’ll keep tryinh despite all her hardship. I know first hand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise” to take that test again” can be very hard but worthwhile .  The author also used the ending to give another meaning to the hibiscus for “when the geese return  and the hibiscus is blooming “ when the winter is over hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring. 	3	2	3
9368	4	The reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph was because at basically explained everything You needed to know for the ending. It basically explains that she is willing to take the time to study for the test she had previously taken and did not pass and wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese had left for the winter. and once they return in the spring, she will take the test over again, in conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the ending of the story.	1	1	1
9370	4	"In the story ’’winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.’’ @CAPS1 is shows that you should fight. For whats right and what you belive in."	0	0	0
9372	4	Saeng did get the feel that she called fil in and. Buying something that could help her but also have her missing were she from. And with her mother get a little mad about it because the prags she pay for. It @CAPS1 vowed silently to herself in the spring that she take the test again.	1	1	1
9377	4	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the @DATE1 time when it won’t be so hard on her. It will be warm again and it’s not quite as cold.	1	1	1
9380	4	Authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by: Minfong Ho there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the gesse come back, and the hibiscus bluming. She is looking at it like that is a new beggining. She wants to start over. Also the gesse, blooming hibiscus, and melted show gives her hope that she will pass her test. She belives now they have a hibiscus maybe it will be more like where she use to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think. 	2	1	2
9384	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph why @CAPS1 it might be important to the author about Saeng. It some thing personely about her past or where she had came for. She trying to say that when she come back in the spring she going to take the test again in school. OR She is going to plants something over again the spring @CAPS1. As snow @CAPS2 and its too cold to plant any thing. That where she came from is really important to her and she miss it and went to go back to where she Come from. 	1	1	1
9385	4	"The author concludes this story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, whe the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again"". She does this because in the story this plant has given her a lot of beilef in herself to @MONTH1 be do better in the future."	1	1	1
9388	4	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start.	1	1	1
9404	4	The author include it because her mother took the test and passed it and the daughter wanted to do the same Just like her mom. And she can only take it in the spring because there is no flowers out in the winter.	0	0	0
9411	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It’s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is.	0	0	0
9418	4	I think the reason why the author ended the story with this “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.” paragraph because like this the plant didn’t have a fight chance for survival in the winter and was same with the girl when she took her driving test but in spring the plant has chance bloom so she has a chance to pass the test because because there time and place for everything.	1	1	1
9427	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1	1
9435	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test over.	1	1	1
9452	4	"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her drivers test but after buying the Hibiscus and taking deeper into things she realized she shouldn’t give up."	1	2	2
9454	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”	0	0	0
9457	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too.	2	3	3
9459	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng was saying this to herself, she made a promise to not give up getting her license and the hibiscus makes her feel like she is at home again. In the text when the mother says, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters.” when she says this it makes Saeng not sad because she knows that the hibiscus will remind her of the hibiscus at home and that gives her the power to want to try again in the spring."	2	2	2
9487	4	In the passage “winter hibiscus” the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph “when they came back, Saeng vowes silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. I believe she concluded this story with these words she change because she is saying to you in that means when the birds flewaway. Even the bird seasons would be back like always. An example of this is when she says the birds eased into the hibiscus. Mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do. This what I get out as the last paragraph are the story “winter hibiscus” as what it means to me.	2	1	2
9498	4	I belive the author used these lines in the last paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 he realy liked it.	0	0	0
9521	4	Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng‘s determination to pass the drivers test. The fact that she failed it made her feel bad, and brought out feelings of homesickness as did the familiar plant, but in this final paragraph she vows that she will overcome all her challenges of being in an unfimiliar place and pull herself together to accomplish her goal as did the winter hibiscus.	2	2	2
9531	4	The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character’s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning.	1	1	1
9532	4	The Author concludes this story With the @CAPS1 paragraph to emphasize the story and make it seem more interesting as to make the reader want the story to keep going on to find out what happens next.	1	1	1
9533	4	I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story is to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it so that is what I think Why the Author Would put this in the story 	1	1	1
9537	4	Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them.	0	0	0
9553	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" Saeng finds comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant reminds her of home and connects her with her past experiances. Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms."	2	2	2
9555	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again.	1	2	2
9558	4	"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, “because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return” the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance”. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again”, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started."	3	3	3
9561	4	In “Winter Hibiscus,” by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. “…in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.	2	2	2
9573	4	The author concludes the story with this because she is say that she is going to grow with the season chang. She is in a new country and just failed her drivers test. She feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story @CAPS1 mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake its strong enough to make it through the winter. I think that Saeng can relate to that because if the flower can make it in the winter tha she can make it in a new country.	2	2	2
9587	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, “I failed the test,” (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.	1	2	2
9590	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.	1	2	2
9597	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane. The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng’s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. Her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. Saeng will Have next spring to take the divers test again.	1	2	2
9598	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back,… then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus remines Saeng of the flower back in her home country this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now."	2	2	2
9608	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,’’ I think Saeng’s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she’s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn’t going to give up and she’ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it’s hard to adjust to changes to life’s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she’ll be able to get situated in this new place.	2	3	3
9610	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.	2	2	2
9612	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.	0	0	0
9626	4	I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on	0	0	0
9637	4	I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.	0	0	0
9638	4	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn’t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don’t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don’t want to, it doesn’t mean you can’t go on.	1	2	2
9645	4	"The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with memories of the past and weeps. Her mother's kindness causes Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother says, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" @CAPS1 that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test. "	2	2	2
9667	4	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.	2	2	2
9676	4	He author concludes this paragraph in this story because It sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happend s to you in life you should Just keep on doing what you think is best for you. Just like the flower she keeps coming back for more after going through all that’s tuff. 	1	1	1
9691	4	Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end	0	0	0
9693	4	I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens	1	1	1
9700	4	The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today.	2	2	2
9709	4	I think that the author uses this quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.” @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. “But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?” “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.” @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 	3	3	3
9712	4	In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.	1	1	1
9717	4	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story “Winter Hibiscus”. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself” but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last “vowe” is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says “and this hibiscus is budding” its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.	2	2	2
9721	4	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.	1	1	1
9728	4	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0	0
9748	4	The author ending the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng wont give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she is gonna try to do whatever it takes. All Saeng trys to do is make her mother happy. When she failed her mother was disappointed. Then suprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother she failed Saeng started to cry, but then her mother wiped the tears away.	1	2	2
9756	4	So she saying she will take the test next year.	1	1	1
9758	4	"Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, ….In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese return”, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that “In the spring"" she will take the test again."	1	1	1
9761	4	"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it."	2	2	2
9788	4	The last paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when “this hibiscus is budding,  then I will take that test again.” Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can’t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom.	2	2	2
9802	4	The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready	1	1	1
9815	4	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.	1	1	1
9822	4	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland. In this way, she’ll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place.   	2	3	3
9827	4	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote “I failed the test” with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening.	1	1	1
9833	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. “The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. “Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.” When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.	3	2	3
9849	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her.	1	1	1
9858	4	The author ends the story this way because by the time winter ends she will have adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus.	1	1	1
9875	4	"In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a “touching” affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself”. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again” This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, that’s why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story."	2	2	2
9878	4	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she’s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example the story says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now”. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance. Almost as if she doesn’t find it that bad as she thought at first it being different and not her home and where she was used to being.  	2	2	2
9894	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is becaus now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph becaus she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.	1	2	2
9897	4	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it’s  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and it’s  something  special to her . Also when all the snow  melts  she  will  take  the test  and  hopfully get her drivers  licesies.	1	1	1
9919	4	The author concludes  with this paragraph, to give a sense at hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng’s  homelard, and it makes her feel comforted. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and  will be able to take the test again. The story  is  about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change. The visual, and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of your struggles ‘seem so much more beautiful	2	3	3
9921	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test and in the winter the plant will die in the spring the plant will bud again and she will retake the test. Its a new chance to start things over.	1	1	1
9922	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, saeng vowed don't really like to talk. Saeng liked to be by her self sometimes. When spring come it was a different story. Saeng loved the spring and @DATE2. She would play outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl	0	0	0
9923	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.	1	1	1
9958	4	"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life.  "	2	3	3
9978	4	The author is showing that Saeng wants to keep on with her mother's gardening. To take over an elders traditions and what her mother started.	0	0	0
9981	4	 In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected.	3	2	3
9985	4	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take care of it still, and that she has not forgotten about it.	0	0	0
9989	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng  relatestnct  she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to then she @MONTH1 be able to pass the test.	1	1	1
9991	4	This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. In this sentence the cold snow, fleeing geese and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she is going through. They are either cold, ready to leave or restricted just like Saeng feels. But, when a new season starts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is no longer restricted in a pot, Saeng will also grow up and be able to take the test. This sentence is put at the end to show how much Saeng can now grow because she has the hibiscus, which is growing with her.	2	3	3
10002	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” ecause that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It’s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, “Not like the kind we had before,” this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,	2	1	2
10005	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."	1	1	1
10008	4	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.	1	1	1
10027	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It’s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. That’s the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  	2	2	2
10029	4	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.	1	1	1
10040	4	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."	2	3	3
10060	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is going to retake the test over when all these things happen. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up, and that she is going to keep trying. The hibiscus is a lucky charm to her to keep during the test to strive her to pass the test. In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, is a indication that it time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a indication that saeng is never going to forget.	2	1	2
10067	4	"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences. SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did."	2	2	2
10089	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. She does because she is ready to do the same thing next year. She like spending time with her mom, she likes plants, she likes having fun with her mom. This are some reasons why she concludes with that paragraph.	0	0	0
10091	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says it’s because it’s strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her lisence test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and she’ll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plant’s situation.	2	3	3
10106	4	I think the author wrote that because maybe that how she fells like in the winter she could really show people who she is but when spring come out she like a flower that has been dead all winter  	0	0	0
10113	4	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more.	1	1	1
10125	4	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the spring time comes, then she is going to take that test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time.	0	0	0
10126	4	The author concludes the Story with this paragraph because I guess her grandma died while the geese were flying. Or thats when the flowers start to bloom.	0	0	0
10127	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""It’s-it’s not a real one, ‘Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at’ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.” One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.” The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."	3	3	3
10134	4	"This paragraph represents an action that Saeng is going to do over a time period of a year. She is going to build up and change in time for the retake of the test its like a rebirth in a way. The girl wants to be a whole new person for when the test comes up again. Her mom seems to be bothered by every action or choice of her daughters. The daughter suddenly relizes the action for the hibiscus and why it dies. ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She relates the flower and geese to herself. Over the year the flower goes through phases dying then rebirth. Saeng wants to get better once she goes through a phase like the flower. Its opens up to be beautiful again.  "	2	3	3
10142	4	She ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus but as the spring comes she’ll feel as anew person ready and able to take challenges as she said here “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now” she describes that with a new season comes new changes and upon those changes she will go on to take the drivers test again.	3	2	3
10161	4	She ended it with that paragraph because she wanted to prove even though she misses the “old centry” she will adapt and survive.	1	1	1
10163	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.	2	2	2
10170	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.	2	1	2
10176	4	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls cofidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.	1	1	1
10177	4	Why did the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Is so he can right another story budding on vowed silently and he will right the. Story in the spring when they come back	0	0	0
10181	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddle from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in vietnam which she loved. The hibuscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces.	2	1	2
10185	4	The author concludes this story with this sentence, because it shows hope for the future. This sentence lets readers know that times are hard now, but in time things will get better. Saeng might have failed this test, but shes not giving up hope on passing it. She believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is right. Saeng might miss her home, but she won’t tell that interfer with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with “when they comeback, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return andthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that tests again.	2	1	2
10186	4	What the author is talking about is that the snow was melting and the spring is coming. I guess what they mean is that flowers, trees and grass are going back beautiful. Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that is not winter nomore. Thats why she start to plant plants in the winter. So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should of add more to the paragraph like how the plants and stuff was growing so beautiful. He shouldn't add more details to let us know, what was talking about in this paragraph.	0	0	0
10194	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in @LOCATION1 now."	0	1	1
10213	4	"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""winter Hibiscus"" to say that the narrator ""Saeng"" isn’t given up on her driving test"	1	1	1
10217	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1	1
10228	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authorconcludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt. and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again'' because the hibiscus represents hope and adapting to circumstances. Saeng is trying to adapt to the new changes in herlife but nothing is working out for her.""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst in to tears again.""@CAPS2, the Hibiscus makes her life easier because it reminds her of her homeland, @CAPS3 it gives her hope, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing, '''the root-bound represents Saeng inher new country. Unwilling to try anything, and getting scared but assoon as Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by planting it, she is going to try to love her new life in @LOCATION1 and in spring when the hibiscus and Saeng is ready to blossom, she will start trying to accept life."	3	3	3
10229	4	Mingfong Ho closes the story with that paragraph because it shows how far Saeng has come and her determination to persevere. The narrator says, “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance “(Ho @NUM1). This is when Saeng is recovering from crying and even though she misses her homeland, she wants to adapt and succeed where she is now. The narrator also said, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again” (Ho @NUM1). Being away from her homeland makes Saeng very ??? (not legible)	2	2	2
10231	4	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says “through the quiet repitition of season upon season” which means that seasons will come a seasons will go but she’ll always be there, ready to “take the test”	1	1	1
10233	4	The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She relizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explaned in the last paragh that once the hibiscus buds she will take the test again.	1	1	1
10241	4	When they came back ,saeng voed silenty to herseif in the spring when the snow melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again .in the story the author put the  paragraph in his story to show what the  girl was doing to improve on her grades.	0	0	0
10247	4	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end.	1	1	1
10254	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to get the point out that the character dosnt want to rush into things she wants to  do right and not take the quick way out.  	0	0	0
10263	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that’s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	1	1	1
10269	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to tell you when Saeng was going to take the test again also ,to reunite with the plant again. This is a conclusion paragraph that gives insight on what will happen in the future that’s also why the author added this paragraph in.	0	0	0
10275	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother too. Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, “she failed the test” probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng  mather’s ask her about the plant that she have with her. Saeng said that she buy the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said “then I will take that test again” @CAPS1 makes her to decide to take it agan it could be the plant.	2	1	2
10278	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to know that she will regain her confidence when the ""hibiscus is budding"" and take another slot at the driving test. He doesn't want to just leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the distance. The girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy."	2	2	2
10289	4	The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she wai’t be able to see the hibiscus .she is used to  going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant In conclusion the author concludes the story that way, because in the winter time she wai’t see  her plant.  	0	0	0
10291	4	The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant.	2	2	2
10299	4	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant don’t most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes.	1	1	1
10307	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng is saying she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story she says that she failed the test, because she did not impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are used to ife in Vietnam, they trying to adapt. Saeng thought that the hibiscus she got Is just like the one she had at home. At the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be @CAPS1 and it will be just like home. She says in the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully growned and she will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to her new country of the United States.	2	2	2
10308	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the “test” again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she “failed the test”, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.	3	3	3
10314	4	"The author ends the story with this quote, because it shows how determined Saeng is to passing her driving test. For example, in the story, “Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng after she fails her driving test says something to forget about fating, and she said, “Let’s plant, right now”, she said this because she was trying to forget about her failing, and focus in something positive, In conclusion, this is why the author ends with this quote, and an example of how determined and focus Saeng is to passing her driving test.    "	1	1	1
10338	4	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.	3	2	3
10348	4	At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.	0	0	0
10349	4	The author  concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gave her some hope. Also , because her mother was understanding  about  her  failing the test. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph .	1	1	1
10350	4	The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.”  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season.	3	2	3
10364	4	“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”	1	1	1
10367	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author ‘write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.  "	1	2	2
10384	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it’s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0	0
10403	4	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn’t ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn’t mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasn’t physicaly and mentally prepared for it. 	1	1	1
10414	4	This paragraph is a good way to end the story because it relates to the test. The narrator says she will try again in the spring. 	1	1	1
10421	4	I believe the author concludes the that passage in the story to show patintions. Saeng was to wait for spring maybe it will feel like her home town again. She likes the spring better than the winter. She likes the birds the geese return in sping. They go away in winter. That way I believe the author concludes that passage.	1	1	1
10422	4	“when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she @MONTH1 have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now “out of the box,” and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and “failed her test.” The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting.  	3	2	3
10429	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...” the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.” The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ‘@CAPS1, Saeng said.’ “After failing her driver’s test, walking into the florist’s shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.  	3	3	3
10436	4	This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.	2	3	3
10438	4	Saeng is @CAPS1 that it Will be a longtime before she will worn about school work again. thats Why the author concluds the story with their paragraph.	0	0	0
10449	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1	1
10450	4	The short story “Winter Hibiscus” as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the floral shop, represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermellon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1 ,represents Saeng’s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus, and returning geese, are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test, and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1.	3	3	3
10454	4	The author Concludes the story with that sentence, because She is excited for spring to come back So she can plant more things and watch them bloom, and come alive.	0	0	0
10456	4	"The author chose that paragraph to put at the end because that is when everything will be perfect to redo her mistake. Saeng said crying ""I-I failed the test!"" @CAPS1 means she failed at what she thought she was good at. “Here let me help mother"" getting up and taking the shovel away from her mother. Saeng is trying to get better at gardening so when she does redo her mistake she will do better. As the reader can see Saeng wants to pass the test, so she can believe sh is a great gardener like her mother."	0	0	0
10478	4	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe because its a good luck thing or its a tradition so its very important that its in the story. Also it could be trying to tell us something like she only take test in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding.	0	0	0
10489	4	I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful.	0	0	0
10506	4	Saeng is talking about her school work and the garden. She always connects the two of them in the same way. she knows that she has to study while the garden grows and she wants to water  the flowers and she is saying that when the spring comes she wont be there for the garden and she will have to take the test.	0	0	0
10519	4	The author concluded the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here. In the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says.” Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home. The final paragraph says,”.. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” When things familiar to her and things their remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again.	3	3	3
10526	4	The author concludes the story with this because its winter now + the flowers are gone, but during that time when she was planting she grew more mature. like it says in the text things she used to think were strange are now becoming firmiliar + shes getting the hang of things. Because shes learning more about it + will be ready for the test next spring. 	1	2	2
10534	4	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because in the story it's about Saeng and she fails her drivers test, and notice a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familian plant it encourages her to retake that drivers test, to where as though the snow is gone and the sun is shining.	1	1		1																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10536	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saeng’s attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her driver’s test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying """"...then I will take the test again.” Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph."""	3	2	3
10542	4	The author concludes the story with this piece because she said “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,” I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng’s wasn’t. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad.	2	2	2
10550	4	The  author includes that sentence of the end of the story because through out the story it was showing  courage,and that explains her getting better and showing  courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test and not letting it get her down that she failed the first time.	1	1	1
10552	4	I think they think it will bring them luck	1	1	1
10609	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open –minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver’s test. For example, “the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,” Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn’t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” I believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.	2	3	3
10613	4	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished @CAPS1 about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she."	2	2	2
10623	4	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” Saeng decides to retake failed driver’s test in the spring. She does so because she is comforted on the moderate weather of the spring. It reminds her of home, and Saeng is very closely attached to home. It reminds me of all the places I’ve been and how I still remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I buy objects that remind me of my old home Saeng’s commitment to her old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home.	1	1	1
10628	4	The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready.	1	2	2
11833	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" he/she incorporated love and passion into the mood. You can tell this by how fondly and strongly Narciso talks about some things. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm houses."" In this one sentence alone, you could feel Narciso's passion and love for this home of the their's. Narciso puts a great deal of love and thankfulness into paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 when talking about his/her parents. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'... I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" These two sentences are most likely the strongest in Narciso's memoir, these two are also the ones filled with the most passion and meaning. As you can see, in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood Narciso puts in it is love and passion. "	3	3	3
11846	5	The mood set by the author in the memoir is a home is home kind of mood, like a great family, great friendships/relationships and open arms kind of feeling. He mentions the fact that his parents always helped friends and family in need and how selfless they were towards other people. He talks about how him and his family used to come together and have meals as a family. He says he is grateful for the spirit an generosity given to him by his parents at a young age. He gives the reader a sence of comfort and generosity and he thanks his family deeply for expressing spirit, generosity and selflessnes to people.	2	2	2
11848	5	In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others.	2	3	2
11851	5	Based on this memoir, the mood created by the author it's a great mood unexplainable. in this article talks about a young man named @PERSON1 and how his life was from then and now. for example, on paragraph @NUM1, says he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices. and how he had always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Also, how Cuban music was so passionate, adored so much, and how his parents turned a simple house into a home. therefore, this is the mood created by the author.	2	2	2
11855	5	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the mood and feeling of her home and comunity is a happy and heartwarming situation. Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was to small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells, wounderful music, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the man people who contributed the most to her wounderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were strugling for money. They never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family show that you can make the best out of any situation.	3	2	3
11856	5	"In the memoir @PERSON1 it talks about making a house a home and a community, your family. ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (par @NUM1) paragraph @NUM1 goes onto talk about how growing up with Italian, Spanish, and Cuban cultures in one community, with all differences aside made the community into a family. Rodriguez talks very warmly, and with only good things to say about his childhood.the mood of the memoir is Rodriguez remembering his culture filled childhood. ""I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love"" (par seven) The memoir is a dedication to his life and a reflection of all the experiences had within his family. He writes his memoirs in loving spirits dedicating his knowledge of a ""family"" to his own."	4	3	4
11863	5	"The authors mood in the memoir @PERSON1 is thankful. I know this, because in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a blessing. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. @PERSON2 quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" In @CAPS2, this shows us that @PERSON2 was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him. Also that he loved his parents dearly and every chance he gets, he thanks them. Therefore in the memoir Narciso gives off the mood of being thankful."	3	2	3
11864	5	The author's interpretation of their childhood home set a mood of love and compassion. He writes about his parents in a way that informs the reader that they were extremely good people. He describes them, as well as others in their community, as honest, hardworking, selfless people. He writes the story with much appreciation of his parents, family, and life, which is very admirable. He describes that he lived in a house with only three rooms, and yet his parents made a home out of it and welcomed others to stay, too. The mood that this author set was that of love and compassion, and he did a very good job of explaining what his childhood home meant to him.	2	2	2
11873	5	The mood the author creates in this memoir is a feeling of relationships and love between so called 'extended family'. The author emphasizes the relationship between Narciso Rodriguez's family and the surrounding neihbors is so close that they could be family. The author incorporates the feeling of overall joy and happiness this boy has, even though they have a small house, they could still turn it into a loving home. The author shows how much this boy loves the heritage he has and his fun parents who taught him to love cooking and cuban music. This memoir shows how he is poor, but still can have a fun and interesting life with lots of friends and fond memories.

This is noticeable in many different ways such as when Narciso says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows gratefulness Narciso per trays to his parents for giving up their life in Cuba. Another example of mood in this memoir is when Narciso states ""Here in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations...."" This passage shows happiness in Narciso's home. It is evident by the tone used by the author that these were happy times. Lastly when Narciso says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together.""

11899	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and kind for many reasons. Narciso Rodriguez he tells why his parents made a hard choice to come to @LOCATION1 and leave all their friends, family, and careers behind.

As well as his cuban upbringing. He describes how thier house was always full with family and friend and how there was always a big cuban feast and cultural music playing.

It made me feel like even through hard times people can find the good in things. This story makes me think of my dad because when things go wrong he can always make a joke or find the bright side of the story."	3	3	3
11904	5	I think that the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this because when @CAPS1 was talking throughout the story @CAPS1 talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are. @CAPS1 talked about her life as being very nice because @CAPS1 grew up in a house that turned into a home. Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Lastly, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @CAPS1 had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them. Those are the reasons I thought the mood set by the author was happiness.	3	3	3
11905	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relatives.""The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing."	3	2	3
11918	5	"I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."""	1	2	2
11937	5	"The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfullness. The reasons that it is thankful if because of the frequent refrences made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents. This is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the author said ""they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrears in the country they loved"" This quote from @CAPS1 @NUM1 shows how grateful Narciso is of his parents leaving everything they had to make a better life for him. The last sentence of the memoir is ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This is showing that the mood is Grateful because Narciso means that he's is thankful because they were able to turn their little house into a place of great friendships and great times. The last reason this article has a mood relative to thankfullness is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM3 when Narciso says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This sentence shows that no matter what Narciso does he can never repay his parents for their selflessness and care. The reason this article is also happy is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM4 when he talks of ""the endless celebrations"" or ""a love of cooking that is still with me today... ""This is showing the ""mood is happy and joyous because it is clear that as a boy the kitchen and cooking were a source of happiness and @CAPS2 in his home. These are reasons as to why the author has created memoir with a mood of happiness and gratefulness"	4	4	4
11947	5	The mood that's created by the author in the memoir is happiness but at the same time sadiness or to give up. Happiness is one mood because the author describes how his family has lived in @LOCATION2 (New Jersey) and how his family was not the only one to immagrate from their country. Their neighborhood is made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants. The author has also made a few friends his first one being Alegria or the landlord's daughter. But the author did show some sadiness when he and his family had left Cuba. They had left friends, family, jobs and their country that they had loved. The author still listens to Cuban music when he does cook.	2	2	2
11965	5	"The mood created by the memoir is thankful and proud. In paragraph @NUM1 it shows that he is thankful. ""... still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)

He decribes his parents cooking skills as ""rich"" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. ""all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people. Another example is when he says, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love.""

12060	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful.

For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir."	2	3	3
12062	5	"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in truly brought everyone in his family together and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love. His parents did a lot for him and, ""Turned their simple house into a home"". He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents and he loves them a lot. These are the moods I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez."	4	2	3

12077	5	"There was a mood created by the author in @CAPS1 memoir. Here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood, his gratefulness, and his view on things. First, parenthesis identify a new mood. When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. Here is my reason why the story, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS2, his gratefulness. @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS3, his view on things. @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes.

12082	5	"People make sacrafices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless.

He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard."	3	3	3
12083	5	The @CAPS1 the author created is sentimental, sad but happy at the same time. I think the @CAPS1 is mostly sentimental because the family moves to @LOCATION1 and kind of looks back to good memories that happend in cuba.	0	1	1

12128	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the other. This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.

The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso. Basically, his first everything was done there. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" The mood created by the author made me feel grateful for what I have in life."	4	3	4
12218	5	The mood created by the author is welcoming and warm. The author makes it so that you want to be @CAPS1 and being able to smell the good food. Also just being able to appreciate the cuban culture.	1	2	2
12221	5	"This memoir creates a peacefull mood. It is telling us of his childhood. Narciso writes, ""In 1961 I was born into this simple house,"". As a child you have nothing but peace. He had many visitors. He writes ""my mother took in refug is welcoming them into the country"". He obviously had a nice enviornment with all those visitors. He is explaining his past. He loves his house and the enviornment it creates. He writes ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home,"". It just put your mind at ease. That is how this article creates a peace ful mood"	2	3	3
12223	5	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get buy. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only defenition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey.	2	2	2
12224	5	"In the memoir, @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS3 is hard and happy.The first place in the story when the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they say that racism is overt. ""Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants overt racism"". this show that the mood is hard because we know that at that time racism was occurring so that made it hard for them to fit in with everybody else.The last place in the story were the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together. ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship"". This displays a happy mood because is represents a whole bunch of diffrent people comming together to work together.As you can see @CAPS3 creates two different types of moods hard, and happy."	3	2	3
12228	5	The mood the author creates is the sadness of living one country where freinds and family lived. To happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states the center of the home was the kitchen where here parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air the the kitchen's aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir.	2	3	3
12237	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a verry happy tone. The reasons that its a happy tone is because @CAPS1 tells about her Childhood hapily by talking about the unity of his invirorment and the happiiness, cuban food, and Cuban music that filled his home and that still fills his home today because he injoyes it so much.	2	1	2
12249	5	He is very greatfull to live in @LOCATION1 and even with all the racism he still found ways to have fun and enjoy life.	1	1	1
12253	5	"The mood created by the author was very happy. The author was grateful to his parents. For example in paragraph @NUM1: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength. For example in paragraph @NUM1: ""I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @CAPS1 will never forget his home. For example from paragraph @NUM3: ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" The mood was very happy. The author was grateful, thankful, and never forgot his home."	2	3	3
12258	5	The mood of this memoir is a good one. It describes how a house is not the same as a home (last sentence in memoir) and how family is more than just blood relatives.	1	1	1
12275	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir would be how fortunite we are to be living here in the united States and how lucky we are to have our education and our friends and families here with us. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This is the mood created by the author in the memoir."	1	1	1
12286	5	The author mood is happy Narciso's was talk about have a family in just one little apartment bliuding and thank them for all @CAPS1 had and what @CAPS1 got	1	1	1
12292	5	The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir.	2	1	2
12299	5	"The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting hapiness. You can see that because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood which is made up of hapiness. One example is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote emphasizes the hapiness and uplifting cheer from the authors endless childhood of home. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the authors family and home. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This quote shows that they keep constant custom of their cultures warmth and detiration. Nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose."	4	4	4
12307	5	The mood in the memoir, that the author is trying to @CAPS1 you is. That it is calm, and in its own way the mood Kind of leads to forgiveness and @CAPS2. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go you never forget about your family. And that the memories are much better then the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you deciede to go, to a different Country. Never forget who gave you birth. And who loves you. Which really means family. And friends. But the @CAPS3 That they describe in the @CAPS4. He decieds to leave his family to go to america and to get an education. And do something big with his life. And he is going through other things to like, the other People are thinking of him as a immagrant. And how the rest of the family @CAPS5 leave there @CAPS6. But the family to them that really didnt mean anything to them. In there house they left there door open to any family that needs help, or that there going through the same thing as what their family is going through. So thats the mood that the author is trying to describe to you.	1	1	1
12308	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the aurthor displays a mood. The mood is very calm and grateful as he explains how he feels to have his cuban culture and lifestyle. Explaining how his family loves cooking and playing music. The author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents. Then the author gets more detailed talking about who lived with him like his landlord and his daughter; his two granparents and others. The author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir.	2	2	2
12336	5	I think the mood to author created was proud and happy. Because he got to come to the United States. And live a better life as a immigrant. And he got to get a better education and he is proud and thankful to have parents like that.	1	1	1
12343	5	"The mood in this memoir is gratefulness. This memoir is basically about how grateful the author is to his parents.The author is grateful to his parents because of their love and sacrifice. The quote, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" From this quote, I can see why the author is grateful. His parents decided to immigrate to give him a better life, at the expense of their families, friends, jobs, and their country.Another reason why the author was grateful was because the author learned that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. In the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. From this snippet, I can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family. He learned a ""family"" was a unity of people that helped each other.The reason why the author was grateful was because of their courage. In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" From this quote, I can gather that his parents were grateful. Most people would've given up from the tall and wide barrier in their way. His parents could've given up, but they didn't. I think it's reasonable the authors should be grateful for his parent's courage.In conclusion, I believe the mood of the memoir is gratefulness, because the author's parents have done everything they could to make it easier for him."	4	4	4
12346	5	In this memoir author makes the mood happy. One example is when they talk about all being a family and letting people stay. Another is when they are talking about the racism and other things but says how the neighbors have united. All in all the mood for the memoir was happy.	1	2	2
12361	5	"In the memoir called, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood is set on this paragraph. it shows and tells how grateful he is. The mood in the story is thankful."	1	2	2
12362	5	The author i think wants to go back to cuba to see his family and friends. Also i think the author wants to move back down to cuba. To stay with the rest of his family and friends and take and maybe take care of @CAPS1 older relative	0	0	0

12406	5	"In the memoir, the mood the author creates is peaceful. @PERSON1 says his family has a warm home, which means it's nice and quiet. Where @PERSON1's family lived, the different cultures that lived in the neighborhood were friendly with each other. In @PERSON1's family, they had countless extended family members who usually joined the family at the table for a nice meal and family get together. @PERSON1's family welcomed many people to their family. @PERSON1 was very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. His family had many rich culinary skills. Their best skill was cooking, which was fun and relaxing to them.

Clearly, @PERSON1 and his family were very friendly and did many things that were peaceful."	3	3	3
12409	5	The story I just read was inspiring. I relized that your true blooded family isnt only your family theres other people that you can bond with and after a little while you can become family according to how close. The mood created my the author was happy. It was happy because everything he said in this story was true and it made me feel lucky to have such a great family and freiends that I call family.	1	1	2

Narciso Rodriguez's famly whent through this move using family power and the love they had for each other. It was a big change for them to be in a one room apartment to a @NUM1 room apartment. Through the memoir there was a mood of satisfaction and love for Cuba. For example, the memoir stated many times how much Narciso enjoyed the Cuban food and music and treditiens. Also the satisfaction mood comes out when Narciso talkes about how fortunate he is that his parents were willing to take the risk of moving to @CAPS2 to give him a better life. This showes that the love of a parent is stronger than enything in the world. Another mood is relieve. for example Narciso is relieved that his family made it to @CAPS2 sofly and sand.

His mood is also saying that hes happy for what he has because he said that his parents are very couragous and he could of never did what they did. The authors mood is very grateful."	2	2	2
12453	5	This story, basically, brings me back memories myself. In the memoir, the author feels a happy, strong, lovable mood. He feels as @CAPS1 those times, are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember those times. That once he gets older, he will take these good times, as granted. Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life. Hopefully he will always be thankful for that oppertunity, that his parents gave him. I know that @CAPS1 my parents did that for me, I would never forget them.	1	1	1
12455	5	The author set a mood for this memoir. The mood he has set is love and kindness. The reason love and kindness is the mood because he says he loves his parents for self sacrifice so that he could grow up in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. The mood is of kindness too because he thinks his parents are kind for letting anyone into their door.	1	2	2

(¶.@NUM1) No matter if you were Spanish, Italian, Cuban, or whatever else, you were treated with love and respect. This portrays the mood of friendship and caring because although they are not ""blood"" family. they take care of eachother as a family member would. Narciso's parents are a large inspiration in his life. ""It was where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

Throughout the years, ""this simple house"" turned into a home"" (paragraph @NUM1). The house was filled with the loving family and special friends turning it into something special in Narciso's life, a home. How close his family and friends were added to the relevence of the home. ""It was the warmth in the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM1).

And very generous because her parents moved for her education. and to get good money to make us happy. The girl's parents welcome anyone into their home as family, and thats why she loves them too. But I have to say she's mostly grateful. Because her parent's are doing every thing to make her happy, and they even have to accept getting a job they dont even like. And for their love and sacrifice. And that's what mood the author feel's in the story.	2	2	2

Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they except one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times.

This is the mood created by the author in the memoir.	2	2	2
12703	5	Within the walls of narciso, her young parents created there traditional @CAPS1 home, There heart was the kitchen. Narciso parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on there rich culinar skills to narciso she love to cook. Quite the countrary narciso neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish Italian immigrants at a time racism. her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, to give their children a better life. They sacafised leaving their family friends and careers, in the county they came from I think her memory is a nice, happy one becuase with those memorys she knows what her family went through.	2	2	2
12705	5	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.'"	2	2	2
12713	5	The mood of the author and the memoir is greatful. The author is very greatful for his parents. He is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him. They moved from their country so that he could grow up in @LOCATION1. His parents quit their jobs and came over all for him. He is also greatful for his extended family and friends. They are the ones who he eats with, plays with and etc. He takes care of them and they take care of him. They are his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles cousins and friends. He is also thank full for his culture. All his food along with traditions come from cuba. The author is greatful.	2	2	2
12720	5	"The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and want his family has done. The author appriciate what his parents has done to other of his parents that immigrated from Cuba. He dedicates what he has learned such as cooking, manners, and friendship to his parents. The author ""admires the strenght and preseverance and have thanked them repeatedly."" overall the author could not had a better family then this, they showed them how to live and that is what a families should accomplish."	2	2	2
12725	5	"I particularly enjoyed this memoir. The author did a fantastic job at creating a sense of love and comfort while telling his story. The first sentence that stuck out to me was in paragraph @NUM1: ""Passionate  Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" To me, that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home. It put out a sense of family in the story. The feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph @NUM2, when the author talked about his family. Especially where the author had said ""My parents  always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The family loved everybody, and used their love to help struggling people, or people who just wanted to visit, get back on their feet and stay in their home. This story was truly filled with dozens of examples of love and comfort, and I really enjoyed reading it."	4	3	4
12732	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and family-like.      The author goes to describe his family, which were loving but poor. His family supported him by growing up in a happy loving home. They cooked nice food, and invited the relatives over to eat. The author show that no matter if your rich or poor, you can still have a closely knit family.	2	2	2
12744	5	Well first the authur feels happy and exsited but he also feels sad cause he is moving to @LOCATION1. In 1961 he was born but In that time he met a friend which was his Babysitter and she was his first friend she lived up stairs from them he has alot of family members but wen he moved to @LOCATION1 his mom and dad took his people that need a home Just until they can get back up on there feet he wants to see his grandparents that cant leave until 1970. But he told his mom and dad he will always be grateful to them for their love and sacrifice he often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than he could have ever done he also often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance andt he thanked them	2	1	2
12751	5	"The mood that the author gives through out this hole artical or, memoir is happiness and family. All during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" the author keeps on saying how much he is thank ful to his parents and how he loves how they were able to give him all they had to offer. That is what he ment when he said he couldn never show how much it means to him. The mood in the memoir is love, family and happiness."	2	2	2
12760	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong. Narciso's mood mostly has to do with his family, friends, and most importantly his culture. Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir."	3	3	3
12818	5	"The @CAPS1 of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful. It shows the hardships his family had to overcome as well as the good that came frome it all. The @CAPS1 states in his memoir, that, although his family was going through tough times, they left their door wide open to family that needed help and always had the thought of others in their mind. He explains how hard it was for his parents to leave their home and jobs in cuba, but that they did it for him, so he would get to live a better life. one more thing the @CAPS1 said in the memoir that was very touching was when he said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me..."" These words show us how much of an impact his parents action had on him and how they helped him in life. These are some examples of how the @CAPS1 describes the mood."	3	3	3
12828	5	In the memoir the author had a certain mood. The mood of the article is somewhat happy because in the memoir the author is remembering good things. The author is reminising and being grateful for being what he is. Narciso is remembering and bringing us through his heritage and home, which is in a happy setting. The mood of the article is happy which the memoir was.	1	1	1
12831	5	"In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso shows a certain love and passion toward his family and culture. The mood of this memoir would be love and passion because of the words and emphisization his feelings. For instance, in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations. @CAPS1 talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way. Another way mood is expressed is through his foreshadowing, showing @CAPS1 kept the tradition going. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" @CAPS1 expresses his foreshadowing in two ways, by adding parentheses and just stating it. A third example of the mood in this memoir is the way @CAPS1 talked about the love for his family, and how important being thankful is. ""I have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Narciso also states @CAPS1 can't thank his parents enough, and if they taught him none of that @CAPS1 would not be who @CAPS1 is as a person today. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Just adding the love and culture to one's house can turn it into a caring home!"	4	3	4
12845	5	The mood by the author in the memoir is touching because i feel like memory story. This story is telling yu how to be memorized about the story and it makes u cry a little bit. I kind the like it a little bit because its about cuban peoples. I think my father knows People from cuban and I think he knows their culture.	0	1	0
12857	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from home: the blueprints of our lives. The mood created by the memoir are described in many ways. To start of with, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that FAMILY had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Quite the contrary, his neighborhood was made up mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2've often told them that they did was a much more courageous thing than @CAPS2 could have ever done. Finally, It was here where @CAPS2 learned the real definition of ""family"". @CAPS2 will never forget his house and his gracious neighborhood and @CAPS2 will never forget how his parent turned this simple house to a home. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from home: the blueprints of our lives. The mood created by the memoir where discribe in these ways."	2	2	2
12862	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that they feel more responcible to help support themself more than anyone else dose as growing up From the young to older, and have been living off their own from being away from your families. I think the mood of the auther is that they feel good about themself and happy to have a better life from the past until now and learn more about themself as they're mood becomes happy and joyful about themself for ""having a better life."" "	1	2	2
12866	5	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage… I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents."	4	2	3
12867	5	"The mood that was crea ted by the author was love, and inspiration The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them. he feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family. So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed. These are some examples of the mood that was created."	3	3	3
12881	5	"In the memoir the author creates a mood that is calm and comfortable. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" that shows that his house is without no yelling or fighting. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home"" that shows while he grew up his home was comfortable for him. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""the kitchen in this humble house where a @LOCATION1 feast always filled the air but life and love that showing that his family was calm and loved each other. The author says in paragraph @NUM3 ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" that shows he was comfortable growing up in his house even though he didn't have lots of things. In conclusion, the author creats a mood for the memoir."	4	4	4
12884	5	The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez, creates in this memoir is a very apreciative and thankful tone. In this memoir is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He shows apreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds. At one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done. He tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are.	2	2	2
12888	5	"The mood in the memoir is very uplifting. The story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him. It also shows how happy the family was and how everyone around them were family iregardless of where they immigrated from. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative""."	2	2	2
12889	5	"The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to creat was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says,"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows thankfulness because she's saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table. The main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness."	2	2	2
12897	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood that the author was happiness. When example of happiness was that his parents passed on their culinary skills and a love of cooking.  Another example of happiness was that aromas from the kitchen mixed with Cuban music filled the air. The last example was that he grateful for his parents sacrifice and love.	2	2	2
12928	5	In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life of also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the poeple that live on the street. Also by how he feels so confortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family.	2	2	2
12948	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" by the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood was happiness because he had his heritage, family and freinds, and the chance to make new lives in @LOCATION2. In paragraph @NUM1 it States ""Skills and love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate cuban music"". This quote is releavant because it shows that @PERSON2 is happy of his heritage. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Family and freinds, and celebrations that encompassed them both."" This quote is relevant to my question because it shows that freinds and family made Narciso happy. In paragraph @NUM3  it States ""In the United States they had to start over entirely taking whatever jobs they can find."" This quote is releavant to my question because it shows that Narciso's family can make whatever they want out of their lives. That is the mood in the memoir ""@PERSON2 @CAPS1"" by Blueprints of Our Lives."	2	2	2
12949	5	"The mood created by the author memoir is... LOVE and Sacrifice. He often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. As he was growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance, and he thanked them repeatedly. As he say ""he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home""."	2	2	2
12957	5	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates an overall mood of happiness, and some sadness at the same time. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains what it was like to live in his home in Cuba. The way he describes his experience in the kitchen cooking and listening to music gives the reader a warm feeling. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him, but they can see unity in his family. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was. ""It was a close-knit community of hardworking immigrants..."" On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to @LOCATION1. ""They struggled both personally and financially"" it says in paragraph @NUM3. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods. Both happiness and sadness are shown in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."""	2	3	3
12962	5	He creates a calming outgoing mood for the @CAPS1 he makes The reader feel, smell and hear the cuban, Spanish influence around him in his home. The feeling inside his home is warm and bright the soothing viberant hispanic vibe that run's through the @CAPS1 brings a great feeling to the reader.	1	2	2
13002	5	"The mood of this memoir is @CAPS1. I say this @CAPS2 his family always let people from the neighbor hood come over and they were like family. His parents let people stay with them ""until they got back on their feet."" @CAPS3 admired his parents for their ""strength and perseverance"". Through everything they had been through."	2	2	2
13003	5	A mood for the memoir would be redeaming. It would be a redeaming mood because it talks about strugles like being an immagrent and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her acomplish what she has become today. Since there are tradteties that help the author lead to success it would be a redeaming mood.	1	2	2
13008	5	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life. And how important my family is to me. It also allowed to see how full and good his was to. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells. Also, the wonderfull music that played and the people that always came over to visit. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir.	2	3	3
13027	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was ment to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was created happy because the child Narciso was very hapy that his parents moved to @LOCATION1. He was also happy because his house was not just a house it was a home. The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home untill they have somewhere elese they can call home. He is also thankful that he got his parents marvilous culinary skills so he can cook very well. He is also thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. The mood that we are suppose to get is a happy yet calm mood well we read this because Their is nothing to exciting but their is some parts where you get happy for what they did and you feel calm because as I said their is nothing really jumping out at you.  it is just a life story.	3	3	3
13030	5	"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood is set right from the beginning. The first thing said to Start the mood was, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)"" This shows the author is grateful and happy. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows how the author is very proud. Also lastly the memoir mentions, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again saw how grateful the author is. In this passage the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start."	3	3	3
13038	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood of this is full of love and happiness.When Narciso is talking about his mother and father he starts to talk about how they always loved and cared. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that the whole house was filled with love because of Narciso's parents. Also,the way Narciso talks about his parents shows that he lovef his parents. This also showed happiness because since he would never forget his home in must've been nice there. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home.""

13052	5	The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home	2	2	2
13057	5	Nacisco was happy of what she had, even though she was poor. She loved her heritage which she still adore today. She is proud of being an cuban. She had good relations in her house. She had great neighbors. Her parents were hardworking and supported her. Her family had a good relationship with family and friends. She appreciated what her parents had done for her. They gave up their career and beloved country to move to @LOCATION1 for her to have a better life. Her friends and family, refugees came to her house all the time. Her baby sitter became her first friend. In @LOCATION1, they celebrated her first birthdays. These event would stay in her memory. She would never forget how her parents turned her house into a home, where she belongs. Her life will always be filled with music and love. So even though she had hard times, she still apreciated of what she had.	3	4	4
13059	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very greatful and happy. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that his parents had good cooking skills and then notes that he is very greatful. So basically he is very greatful that he had or has a chance to life as @CAPS1 and have the opertunities that others don't have. And very, very happy that he did not just live in a house. his parents made it into a home with loving memories and his family moments.	1	2	2
13062	5	The author created a mood of happiness and love. When Narciso Rodriguez was thinking back to the past he loved his home and his parents for what they did for him. The way, he lived was the mood of his house. It was free and welcoming. Just as the way his parents were to other immigrants. Narciso Rodriguez's cubian home was one of the most important things he cared about and grateful for.	2	1	2
13067	5	The author did a good job bringing different moods into the memoir. There was a sad mood but also happy at times to. When there was a happy mood the memoir was more enjoyable. The last sentence leaves people knowing he wouldn't trade it for anything	0	1	1
13078	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir."	3	3	3
13079	5	"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."	4	4	4
13085	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir. Is a very happy and grateful mood. It is happy because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, Formed the backdrop to life and are warm home. It is grateful because he says in paragraph @NUM2 ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it means leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. This is the mood created in this excerpt."	2	2	2
13118	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is happy and warm. This is because of the strong and caring relationships talked about in the memoir. As stated ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 the story that is what is talked about. In the story he talks about being aroud ""family"" people who arent blood realative; just that can make a person happier @CAPS2 the memoir make the reader happier because the author is writing about happy memories he'll never forget. Although it was simple the author put a lot of deep emotions that were portrayed in the story, which made the story has a deeper mood."	2	2	2
13150	5	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family were your not expecting too.He sets the mood in the memoir, that portrays love, warmth, and happyness. The overall mood of the memoir is loveing. Like how Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love.""When Narciso was growing up he learned that ""... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and Friendship. So Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, @CAPS1 mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up!"	2	3	3
13176	5	In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrafice. That's telling us they get along well and really care for eachother. And then there is his siblings that live in different parts of the apartment. They help set the table and eat with them so I can tell they are all really loving and caring and all enjoy being a family together. This why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood.	2	2	2
13177	5	"In  ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 the author creates a mood. I think this is the mood of exceptance. @PERSON2 talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood with many other immigrants. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees celebrate their arrival to this country""... This shows that no matter how diverse people were. the author's family always accepted them and their differences. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, and knowing they would do the same for us.""

I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy.	3	2	3

The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasent to be inside."	2	1	2
14837	6	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The builders of the Empire State Building faced opstacles in the building of the Empire State Building, in allowing dirigibles to dock there.One reason is that Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office) had made the tower tall... The hight of the building was 1,250 ft. But after almost losing the title of worlds tallest tower he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower.Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) That Could @CAPS2 people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock off. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937 the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York.In the 1930's the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to proform a stunt. The Empire State Building never got to fofil what it was made for."	1	1	1
14842	6	The obstacles the builders face were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3	3
14846	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to construct this marvelous building One obstacle was making sure the stress of the building from the dirigible would go to the foundation of the building and not the top or middle where it could cause it to collapse. As said in the text ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 the building had to be changed in many ways to make it stable enough for dirigible to dock.Another obstacle was the weather above the building which was very strong winds and air currents. This would mean that the dirigible would just be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" and that's not a safe thing to have highly flammable hydrogen floating around above millions. An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast. This took people going to professionals like the Navy and finding out the proper way. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building caused many obstacles to get in the way."	4	4	4
14851	6	"The builders of the empire state buildings had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Things such as the wind, the actual docking, and the people getting off safely. The actual docking was impractical it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch.     The wind was the main reason for the fate of the mast. First the wind current was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time getting close enough. The captain of the, ""Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also even if it could tie up the back of the dirigible would swing around fiercefuly. So the builders were dealing with an impractical task"	2	3	3
14859	6	"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a facinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole ""age of transportation"" (@NUM1). Unfortunately this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. Later the architects that were building the mooring mast had discovered that their idea was not going to be fulfill. The idea had too many obstacles to overcome. The fact that ""most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM2). If anything was to go wrong, it would be catostrophic seeing as how below them were highly populated streets. Also, ""the greatest obstacle was nature itself"" (@NUM3). There was just too much wind to keep the aircraft steady and undercontrol. The reality of the fact was that the idea to moor derigibles sounded great but there are far too many risks to carry out the plan."	2	4	2
14863	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the Building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. The last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame. It was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast.	2	3	3
14879	6	There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirible, the buildings frame would have stress. (paragraph @NUM1) They also noticed that the diribles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM2). A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. (paragraph @NUM3). Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM4). With the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.	2	2	3
14903	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety reasons, weather conditions, and government laws, defeated the purpose of the mooring mast on top of the building. For example, many of the dirigibles used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium, ""hydrogen is highly flammable... above a densely populated area."" (@NUM1). The builders realized this was not smart. Furthermore, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This created a dangerous situation because the ship would swing around the mast. Lastly, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting a ship to even approach the building. ""...an existing law against airships flyinging too low over urban areas"" .(@NUM3) The whole idea that was built up to something great had slowly dwindled. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many more, in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2	3
14936	6	During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was @CAPS1 Nature. The winds at this height are shifting to frequently causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building. These obstacles forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction.	3	3	3
14943	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to realized that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had problem on its own anyways. According to the excerpt, one of its greatest obstacle was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This resulted to being a problem because the dirigible could go anywhere, not landing in the mast properly and cause damage. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets. The dirigibles ""...could be weighted down in the back with lead weights"" because it used open landing fields. This was not a good idea to be using these at the Empire State Building. Another thing builders should have considered was that there was a law in place already that is ""...against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All in all, there were alot of things that builders should have considered before attempting to allow dirigible to dock there"	3	3	3
14973	6	"The empire state building builders had to face hard obstacles by.... ""accommodating passengers,"" new routes, and the greatest obstacle was to nature itself. By accommodating the passengers they had to bring them to the existing transatlantic routes. This was because the new routes weren't made yet. Reasoning being is because the building needed to be more taller. So then they added more things on the top of it. They wanted the State Building to nature itself because the building @CAPS1 Shifting from ""violent air currents"". Also the dirigible was more open fields to the moor. The State building also was weight down by the lead weights."	1	1	1
15006	6	"I've been to the Empire state building before, right up to the top. The top was not opened, but several windows were, and our thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. Trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible I was waiting for that factor to come up the whole story, and it finally did. ""The winds on top of the building work constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) In addition to parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang-plank, which would not be too fun. Another problem they faced was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) I would think that before spending @MONEY1 on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law-wise. When I read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start."	3	3	3
15019	6	"Based on excerpt, ""The Mooring @CAPS1,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents, and the safety of pedestrians.One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the violent air currents. According to the excerpt, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting. So if a dirigible happened to get caught in this they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Example of this would be, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring @CAPS1 the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) Another obstacle was the safety of pedestrians. When owners heard about the German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided that it would be even worse if it had taken place in a heavily populated place like New York. An example of this would be, ""owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""In conclusion, the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such as the violent air currents and the city pedestrians."	3	3	3
15020	6	The Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. This building being so tall, and large wind shifts were a constent worry. Wind shifts, is when the direction of the wind shifts suddenly. One minute its @LOCATION1, the next its @LOCATION2. On may 6, 1937, when German dirigible Hindenburg, caught on fire, people thought, what would have happened if that was over the empire state building. over New York, with such a large population, it would have been hectic. Airships werent allowed to fly that low anyways.	2	2	2
15034	6	"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as safety, nature, and legislation. First, it would be difficult to safely allow foreign dirigibles to dock. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This displays the fire, and therefore safety, was an obstacle. Next, air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The air near the top of the building was affected by air currents, so it was difficult for pilots to land. Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" There was no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an obstacle. Finally, there were laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The very purpose of the moor would be illegal, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding the moor, and its opening was never successful as a result of them."	3	4	4
15074	6	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury."	3	3	3
15077	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in atempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The bigest obstacle is to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. One set of engineers and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of moooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to vilant air currents. These are some of the many obsticles of the Empire State building faced wile atempting to alow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2	2
15080	6	There are many reasons Why the builder's faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states that most dirigibles from outside of the United states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The hydrogen can cause a fire and destroy the Empire State building and can destroy downtown New York. Another reason why the builder's faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was against the law. In paragraph @NUM2 the exerpt states there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This could be dangerous to the citizens of downtown New York.	3	2	3
15083	6	"There were many obsticles the builders of  Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One obsticle was the buildings frame was not prepared for it. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The frame of the building could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have had to be made. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City. From the beginning, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ridiculous."	3	3	3
15099	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium make them lighter than air."" The first problem is that it's material could be broken if happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" did not help. Since the dirigibles could not be weighted down at the Empire State Building, it would be dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with hydrogen and helium, ""most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With these obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there, the theory did not work out in reality."	3	3	3
15108	6	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstical was that it lacked safty. Dirigibles are highly flammable machiens when used with hydrogen, and a fire in New York City would be tragic..  Another obstical that the Mooring Mast faced was @CAPS1 Nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with a electric winch, allowing the dirigibles to move freely. When the winds of @ORGANIZATION3 were to blow on this situation, the diridles would ""swivel around & around the mask"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) this would cause tension to build on the buildings frame and lead to a very unsafe inviorment. The last reason was that there was a law created that stated that it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safty reasons leaving the whole Mooring Mast to be unusable."	3	3	3
15134	6	"The builders faced a few problem on letting it dock there. One problem was that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" said on page @NUM1. The were all so lead weights to lower the dirigibles down but this could also set risk for people said on page @NUM1."	2	2	2
15150	6	"In the @DATE1's dirigibles were considered the transportation of the future. Trying to make New York the forefront of modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State building rushed to the challenge of building a mooring mast failling to recognize the obstacles that lay ahead. As the architects designed the mast they quickly realized the frame of the building was not equipped to handle the weight on top of its flat roof. Making those adjustments had cost builders more time and New York City more money. In addition workers had not considered wind currents. In this excerpt the writer says ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 workers should have considered possible obstacles before building something as big a project as a mooring mast."	3	2	3
15158	6	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's Frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders @ORGANIZATION1 many different obstacles.	3	4	4
15184	6	Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building on top of New York. He envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. Techical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. First, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure there landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be ever more problematic in the city as if a Dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city. Neither of the Dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of @LOCATION1 would have been, safety problem could not be fixed and there were too many people around to risk it.	3	2	3
15224	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include, poor designing, nature, and lack of landing area.Due to the poor designing of Al Smith the Age of Dirigibles had a concern on where to land them. Nature itself was a big obstacle as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind made this hard for the dirigibles to land. The last obstacle was the lack of landing area for these enormous balloons. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he took it."	2	2	2
15230	6	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well thought out.	4	3	4
15234	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles."	4	3	4
15235	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated New York City. Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe In addition to the safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building.	3	1	2
15260	6	There are many problems the dirigibles had with docking.  The one problem there was is a lack of suitable landing space.  There was also the problem of winds.  The wind would cause a major problem for if they could dock.  The wind could cause it to spin around the building causing injuries to people or the dirigible.If it's swong around an hit the building it could cause structural damage.  The dirigible could also explode into flames if a spark is caused from it hitn the building.  It could end up like the hindenburge.	2	2	2
15262	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles (Blimps) to dock there was that there were way too many risks that were being taken to make this mast and it was just too dangerous.I think that the mast opposed too many risks because for one it would be flying too low and two, if it caught on fire or was hit by lightning it would explode and people would get seriously hurt, OR the mast could snap off!As @PERSON1 said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.""@CAPS1 @PERSON1 Clavan means is that the fact that there are so many problems with mooring air ships to this ""mast"" that it just isn't safe to go through with right now!"	1	3	1
15265	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people."	2	3	3
15270	6	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building were, They had planned for dirigibles to tie to the mast could not because the way of the height of the building was @CAPS1 high dirigibles would not be able to keep @CAPS2 while unloading. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the goodyear blim columbia, attempted a publicity stunt Where it would it tie up and deliever a bundle of newspapers"", ""Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had Never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of newspapers on a rope dangling from the blimp"". other obstacles were, that dirigibles outside the united states had hydrogen in them Instead of helium, and hydrogen was very flammable."	2	2	2
15273	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. To prevent this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified in strengthened and to accommodate this new situation. Secondly, most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners realized that if one of the hydrogen dirigibles were to catch fire just like the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, @LOCATION4, the accident could be much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle that the builders were faced with was violent air currents while the dirigible was tethered. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to winds in using lead weights to weight the back down, where they would be dangling above pedestrians would neither be practical nor safe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.	4	3	4
15320	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with several obstacles on they attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could with hold the stress of the dirigible's load. In stanza @NUM1 the author writes, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to ameliorate this problem. Next, the greatest obstacle they faced was the strong winds on top of the building. In stanza @NUM2, it say, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This arrived as a huge problem as the architects could not weigh down the back of the ship because it could endanger pedestrians. Lastly, in stanza @NUM3 it states there is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building or even come close to the area. Due to these three obstacles the plan of using a mooring mast became an idea of the past."	4	4	4
15325	6	"The builders of the Empire State building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  Because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  It was such an expensive modification because they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the"" flat roof on the Empire State Building.  The stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's frame would be too much, this was their obstacle.  The builders needed to strengthen and modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired."	1	2	2
15400	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building. The first obstacle realized was the safety issues. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on. It could be a danger to the urban areas underneath. Those were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast, to fail.	3	3	3
15408	6	"Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building: one obstacle the builders encountered was the fact that when a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, it would add to much stress to the buildings framework because of a combination of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure atop the massive @DATE1 foot structure. To solve this, the build had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 with these two reasons, there was already a law against airships height in urban areas and by talking a dirigible at the building would break it. As seen by this paragraph there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	4	4
15414	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacles was that the building with a mooring mast on the top of it attached by one cable to a dirigible ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another obstacle was to fix the buildings structure so it could with stand the mast."	2	1	2
15445	6	"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As in paragraph @NUM1 ""the greatest reason was safety."" The most important issue was the blimps used hydrogen which was highly flamibale. An accident would of been tragic because of the heavily populated downtown @CAPS1. Also nature proposed a big obstacle as well ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS2 there was an existing law against flying airships to low over urban areas."	2	2	2
15461	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New @CAPS1 walk. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as @CAPS2 says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed. "	3	3	3
15483	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders wanted to add a mooring mast top of the building, to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, or service, they couldn't do that because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Al Smith didn't get to allow the dirigibles to land on the building because of how skinny the top was."	1	1	1
15499	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structeral and safty issues. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollares' worth of modifications to the buildings framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pidestrians created a even bigger obstacle for the builders.Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazzards ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Even though the exsisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles shells could be punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents."	4	3	4
15549	6	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass. This made the mass unsafe. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete having the highest building in the world."	3	3	3
15551	6	"The empire State Building builders faced  different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations ""to learn more about them first hand. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation."" This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles."	3	1	1
15555	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (¶@NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶'s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. the winds up there were very strong, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful."	2	2	2
15568	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were. The used of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell. These are the reasons and obstacles why its hard to attempt the dock of the dirigibles.	4	3	4
15571	6	They had problems with the dirigibles trying to land it thyre. The dirigible could have caught fire and it would have been worse. It was dangerous to attach piece to the part.The high wind was a problem.The dirigible could burn up fall down and people would die below.	1	2	2
15604	6	Some obstacles that the empire state builders had while creating the Empire state building is having to deal with all fast winds. This reason being is because the giant needle that was build on top of the building was waving back an forth. which mad it harder to keep in place.Another obstacle would be, @CAPS1 bringing the dirigible or blimps towards the giant needle. It would pouncher the blimp. There was only made of cotton fabric.	1	1	1
15612	6	"New technology, especially in aviation,requires work to be done, thus causing many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State building a success, the builders would need to know how to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and able to set passengers on and off. A quote from the text supporting this would be ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". (6). But the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass. The stress a dirigible would put on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the actual building. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1). Even with all these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed to failure for reasons the builders could not fix."	2	2	2
15613	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented because dirigibles were to dock there. The first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled by hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature: ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way. The last obstacle was an existing law against airships fly too low over urban areas which means that it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there were presented many obsticles as shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast."	3	3	3
15614	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress *** to the building.The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area.The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building.	2	1	2
15623	6	"In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was having to make changes to the steel frame of the building in order to have the strength to ""accommodate the new situation. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS2 that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"", @CAPS1 this was a costly project as well. The excerpt also @CAPS2 that there were problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving. The dirigible would be in a very windy area, and there was only one chord attached to the building which would leave the back moving around all over the place."	3	2	3
15646	6	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were That architects cannot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They would also have modifie and strengthened the steel frame of the Empire State uilding and all this was going to be worth sixty thousand dollars of modifications. Theese engineers had to try to dope out a Practical workable arrangement and also the government People in washington were figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast. This idea of doing this was neither practical nor safe because all this things would be dang ling high above Pedestrians on the street. This could have never happened either because there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Theese were some of the obstacles the builders faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building.	3	3	3
15660	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground.	2	2	2
15662	6	"In the @ORGANIZATION1 there where many problems that where faced durring the build. The Way that this all @CAPS1 was when the archetect Al Smith wanted to make a building like no other, A building that was taller than the new chrysler building and one that was futureistic. The first problem that they ran into was, what was a building of this size going to be used for? There where many differen't ideas but the one that came to Al @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was transportation. This building could be used for a new kind of transportation where people could board a Dirigible ""also known as a blimp"" at the very top of the building. the next problem was if this would be safe to do because they couldn't have a big problem in the middle of New York. The idea went to Washington to be reviewed and ended up not being safe enough. Al Smith didn't care, His building was the tallest."	0	1	1
15663	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was nature itself.	1	1	1
15665	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. If that had happened at the Empire State Building it would have had extremely drastic results. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners of the Empire State The building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 were just three of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3	4
15691	6	A dirigible is not like a plane or a hot air balloon, it is filled with flamable gases, and to try to dock something that big on top of the worlds tallest building would be extremely dangerous too the urban town below and extremely dangerous for the workers.	1	1	1
15692	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" author Marcia Amidon Lüsted speaks of the obsticles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the frame of the Building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. Therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. As the excerpt says, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building."	4	4	4
15693	6	The builders of the empire state building @CAPS3 many different obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was to be able to design the mast without having to reconstruct a big part of the building. Also a big aspect of it was that they had to face was to be able to make it safe. These big dirigibles can be very flammable and having something that major in a very populated city like new york would be very risky and unsafe. The last problem they @CAPS3 was nature. Of course you canot change nature so this was a problem was there since the beggining but was probably overlooked or never even thought about. So this really never would of been able to suscesfuly work without any problems.	2	2	2
15695	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The dirigibles also called blimps were very big, this was a problem because they were to large and could not get to the building and ""most dirigible outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (par. @NUM1) This is bad because an accident could occur and the blimp could explode right over the city and hurt thousands of people The winds above the building were sometimes violent and it was hard for dirigibles to reach it, ""Even if the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (par. @NUM2) It was difficult attempting to allow dirigibles dock the Empire State Building. The purpose in which the top of the building was created could not be used because it was to dangerous."	3	3	3
15707	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was that it was very dangerous to have a hydrogen (highly flammable) filled dirigible dock over one of the most densely populated areas at the time. They could not let the accident that had happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey happen in New York: ""..., The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes: ""The winds on top of the building were consular shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigible would not be able to stay steady for docking or unloading. Other ideas to solve this problem like weights were, ""neither practical or safe."" The final obtacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". As shown, It was simply impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building because of natural causes, danger, and the law itself."	3	4	4
15709	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Building. One of the greatest reasons was saftey, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is also highly flammable. Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move. But there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to moor a dirigible	4	4	4
15710	6	The builder of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the Mooring Mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. Another issue was safety and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably.	2	2	2
15739	6	The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers.	2	3	3
15740	6	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, There were many problems to face to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building. These obstacles composed of the dirigibles themselves, natures winds, and laws that prevent dirigibles being allowed to dock. Some dirigibles from outside the state used hydrogen, a flammable gas, and could cause mass destruction to New York City due to being about the same length as four blocks, in New York City."" Wind caused the dirigibles to swivel around even after being tied down. Since there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."", doing so could cause the captain of the dirigible to be arrested."	2	3	3
15763	6	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that arose was construction of the mast atop the building. According to the excerpt, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" From this you immediately know that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be properly modified in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast. Another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative. ""... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside..."" @CAPS1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS2, the winds at that altitude would have been to unstable for a dirigible to dock.

The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Buildings frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might clasp.

If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) in an area heavily populated like New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast.

The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""

Another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows another obstacle because builders could not find a practical way to get the passengers off, and putting lead in the back would only endanger the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

Adding the single cable tether would add to much stress to the buildings frame, the workers would need to modify and strengthen the buildings frame. Another problem they didn't realize at first was the wind, from violent air currents. With all these problems that were not easily fixed, eventually the idea of a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building dissapeared."	2	2	2
15803	6	Throughout the excerpt, on trying to build the empire state building; the builders faced a lot of hard attempts trying to build the dock for the dirigibles. One major problem is that the dirigible was not able to land on the buildings flat roof. This was stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt. Another problem is that they had to design elevators and stairs for the passengers to travel to the top of the building to be able to get on the dirigible. Along with designing stairs they had to be able to build 102 floors just for the area where the blimp would land. This can be supported in paragraph 11 and @NUM2 of the reading. After trying to build the big building, the builders ran into major safety concers towards the end of the making. The builders did not think they would run into any problems or think of the safety.	1	1	1
15809	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. With downtown New York being a densely populated area, that wouldn't be such a great idea.Another obstacle they had to face was the weather itself. The Empire State Building was very high so it got really windy. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents.They also weren't thinking about the government when they were building the mooring mast. There was a law stateing that airships couldn't fly to low to urban areas. It would be illegal if a ship even tried using the mooring mast.	2	3	3
15831	6	The Empire state building faced different stage. They @CAPS1 to make it to be fixed a little bit. Because it was the tallest building at the time and they so @CAPS1 it a more famous.	0	0	0
15859	6	When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to think about the Safety of allowing the dirigibles and their passengers dock there. They had to think about the winds at the top of the building. The wind currents change violently at the top of the building and because they wouldn't be able to weigh the back of the ship down, the dirigible would spin around and around the mooring mast. They also had to think about dirigibles from other countries. These dirigibles used hydrogen which is more flammable then the helium ships.	2	3	3
15862	6	The builders of the empire state building could not build the moor mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of Empire state building was to flat. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building. They design the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers. However it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They think greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air current, so it can pratact from worst accident but it is still not safe.	2	2	2
15874	6	The architects of the Empire State Building faced too many challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. First, there was the matter of safety. If a hydrogen zeppelin were to catch fire over New York City, it would be disastrous. It could start a huge city fire. Also, the wind was capricious up there, and would make it extremely difficult to dock and stay docked. The Navy tried to, but was unsuccessful, because the wind did not allow for them to even get close to the mast. Third, there were laws preventing airships from flying too low over cities, which really put an end to the whole idea. The plan was dangerous from the start, albeit a really awesome one.	2	3	3
15875	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced attempting to allow derigibles to dock there are the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. But the greatest obstacle was the wind, which would constantly shift, due to violent air currents.	2	2	2
15881	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we are informed of the many obstacles standing in the way of landing a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle can be found in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than hellium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" As you can see the use of hydrogen would provide a great hazard to New York City as a dirigible was landing on the top of the building. It is a highly populated spot and could be potentially very dangerous. Another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph @NUM2. It stated that ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 to the wind. Lüsted informs us of the terrible hazard of the air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. All in all, many obstacles stood in the way for allowing dirigibles to dock, and in the end that is why it wasn't successful."	2	2	2
15952	6	In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.	4	3	4
15955	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the buildings framework. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it desirable to postpon to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes.	3	2	3
15962	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself.	2	1	2
15965	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to obstruct dirigibles to dock on the top of there building. They faced obstacles like laws, saftay problems, and also natural problems when trying to successed this gutsey idea. They firsted faced the problems of law, ""An existing law aginst airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed an obstacle for the builders because they would have to dock the blimp without flying in this restricted fly zone. The Second problem was dealing with saftey, ""when dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed... Owners of the Empire State building relized how much worse that accident could have been over downtown New York."" After blimps were proven to be highly flamable the builders saw that an accident over highly populated New York City would be worse than a rural area. Finally the builders face problems with nature, ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The builders relized that the drastic change in @LOCATION2 at the top of the building where not apperate for a blimp. These designers had more than a mundane idea but it was shot down with the multiple obstacles that a-rose."	3	4	4
15969	6	"The idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place. When these dirigables would try to dock to this building, the structure of the building wouldn't be able to handle the violent winds and the zeppelin. It caused many problems. What if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew it's tail end around to hit a building. The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this occurred in such a heavily populated place, it would be chaos. Impractical and unsafe, this plan wouldn't work. They would need something more stable. The plans of this weren't completely thought through. All these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear. These plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel."	3	2	3
15976	6	In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dringibles dock on the Empire State Building. At first Al Smith wanted this newly designed building to be the tallest one in the world. Now this 1,250 foot building would reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing drigible to dock there. Passengers to get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refuling its engine. Although this was a great idea there were many issues that the constructor did not see, This is because the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage, to ensure that no damage or harm would be put on the building or residents of New York the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened. This cost the city of New York over @MONEY1 in the hopes of putting it on the map for modern travel.	2	2	2
15985	6	"Obstacles the builders haded to face with the empire state building was that they did not had the enough technology to land a dirigible on the mooring mast. February 1931 @CAPS1 clavan of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a heigh made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear""     After @CAPS1 clavan said that the using of the dirigibles had dissappeared. by the late 1930s, the dirigibles had been given away to Airplanes. Also builder haded to construct electric winch and gang plank the electric winch is hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast, and gang plank to a open observation plataform.     "	1	0	1
16006	6	In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today.	2	3	3
16007	6	Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flamable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obsticles in their way the owners and builders of the Empire state building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear.	4	4	4
16008	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders went through many obstacles to get their @CAPS1 done.The builders thought they had every all set and under controll. when they had made their plans they had planed for the mist to be a big pice. when they had made the mist it just wasn't right. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Then they had more problems because a law was p being passed that the ships could not tie them self to the buildings they wouldn't have anyone visit the building. But they solved that problem by haveing the airplanes bring the passengers. Even though the builders went through many obsticle they still managed to get passed them."	1	2	2
16029	6	The builders of the Empire State Building and encountered numerous obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles including a weakened framework, nature and weather, potential fire hazards, and U.S. laws. Because the building was not originally designed to hold down dirigibles, the frame was not sturdy enough to survive the pulling and moving of the blimp in the air. The dirigibles would also be vacillating in the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which was 102 storeys. Aside from pulling loose or damaging the building itself, the dirigibles were in danger of being punctured by another building's spire. Damage to the dirigible in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area in New York City around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and blowup, such as the case with the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians or other structures could be seriously damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also probable because of the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws forbid airships to come that close to urban areas like @ORGANIZATION2. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it. In conclusion, many issues surfaced for the builders as they attempted to transform the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles.	4	4	4
16071	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians.Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings.	3	3	3
16073	6	After reading excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame. This pressure along with the wind pressure would have to be converted all the way to the buildings foundation. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Although was a bright idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out properly.	2	3	3
16075	6	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock."	3	3	3
16077	6	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The safety of the people were at stake, nature was also a great obstacle, the other reason was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it was against the law.First of all, the builders obstacle that they completely forgot about was the safety of the people. Most of the blimps from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen other than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. And they did not want to risk anyone getting hurt in a densely populated area. Also, another big obstacle was @CAPS1 nature itself. At times the winds would be violent and it would go back and forth. And if a blimp was attached, it would be dangling violently over citizens had not nearly safe. Lastly, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas and New York was highly dense. And the reason for this law is for nothing bad to happen to the citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles the builders had gone through, and they were blinded by the project and they wanted to get it done they forgot about safety."	3	4	4
16078	6	There would have been multiple obstacles when allowing a dirigibles to dock a the top of the empire state building. One it may get very densely populated with taller buildings. Since they had never made one before something could go wrong And last like the Hindenburg another disaster like that could happen but This time in a densly populated city	1	1	1
16106	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allowing dirgibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever more there. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles.  With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people few on airships anymore. In conclusion, several obstacles prevented the docking of dirgibles to the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
16116	6	"In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, we learn about how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually meant to be a landing spot for dirigibles. However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because they were mostly made of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since the dirigible would possibly catch fire about New York City. Next, there was the problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent and the back of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around. Using lead weights to hold it down were a possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, though they should've seen them coming, in trying to get dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."	3	4	4
16118	6	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, talks about the height of the buildings, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architecture who built the Chrysler Building was secretly hiding something. The secret was that he constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, it shocked many people and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building. Now it's a height of 1,046 feet, which is 46 feet taller than the height of the Empire State Building. One obstacle to their expand use in New York city was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought that a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers on and off. The mooring mast couldn't just simply drop a mooring mast on top or the building. Adding a mooring mast to a cable tether could add stress to the buildings frame. They finally build the mooring mast and they raised the American flag again."	1	2	2
16121	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" @CAPS1 obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around.Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came and played. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The idea was never successful due to the obstacles presented."	3	2	3
16138	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges ranged from nature itself to laws against it. They didn't take into consideration the constantly shifting air atop the building. At such heights as the moring mast violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. This was also due to the fact that the blimp would only be tethered in the front. Not only were those large factors coming into play but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State. They didn't think about the existing law. It stated that air ships flying to low or over urban areas was against the law. So many factors came into play with building such a project. Overall it was too far fetch of an idea.	2	3	3
16184	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, someone attempted a publicity stunt where they would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The workers moring equipment had never been installed because, putting the workers having to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp in great danger. Also, the wind at the top of the building put workers at great risk of falling off, or dying	1	2	2
16185	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when tempting to let dirigbles dock there. There were @NUM1 major problems of why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were what was in the dirigbles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships.     Dirigbles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigbles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamible. This coud have resulted in terrible way if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densed.     Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people.     Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict than the dirigibles wouldnt be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city.     In, conclusion there were many obstacles that the archtects dont think about before constructing."	4	3	4

""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. Although the mast was finished due to @CAPS1 Nature a new law no dirigibles has ever docked at the Empire State Building."	2	2	2
16198	6	"The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, drove him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task which lay ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects knew they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced with how to adjust the frame of the building to support the docking site. The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1). They were able to overcome this obstacle but many more loomed up ahead. The wind and weather needed to be taken into consideration as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" (par. @NUM2). Reluctantly the builders admitted to the inevitable obstacle posed by nature. The builders seems to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densley populated city was an all around dangerous idea. It was noticed that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @NUM3) and a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM4). The impossibility of the plan was realized for there were too many obstacles to face. The builders gave up hope but the moorings still looms atop the Empire State Building as a reminder of what could have been."	3	4	4
16199	6	"The early @DATE1's was a time where everyone was out to find and build the next best thing. In @CAPS1, two tycoons were competing to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man creating the Empire State building, had an idea to make his building taller and more popular; build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though a good and creative idea, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be more than they bargained for.first off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was very unpractible without changing the whole design."" The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation"", (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Also, the dirigible would put so much stress on the foundation of the building.

Nature was also a giant obsitacl these architects faced while building this.

16201	6	"In order to dock these dirigibles, the builders would face many serious problem. These problems in which builders would be forced to deal with is when, a city, and framework. First off, the building frame was too weak to tied to a dirigible. This is because it ""would add stress"" to the frame which could ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Due to this they would be forced to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars"" to strengthen the frame. A second issue the were faced with is that it is in a city. Laws had prohibited ""flying too low over urban areas"", let alone ""tie up to the building"". Due to this fact, they would be forced to design a way for it to dock. Finally, ""violent air currents"" would cause more issues. The builders would have to deal with building a piece mooring equipment that could with stan the wrath of ""nature itself"". All in all, this plan would force many issues on the builders, in order to function"	3	4	4
16208	6	"In the building of the mast that was to be used to dock and refuel dirigibles the builders and arcitect @CAPS2 many daunting problems For one thing a simple mooring mast could not be placed on the roof of the Empire State Building. The mast would add to much stress to the buildings frame work and cause it to colapse, along with the imense wind power. Another problem was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium to inflate there dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly Flammable. There was also a law that stated that airships could not @CAPS1 too low over urban areas One of the Final and most important reasons builders @CAPS2 obstacles was the constantly shifting wind due to violent air current.

16212	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been completely different from anything before, but never continued because of obstacles. The builders faced issues such as safety issues, harnessing nature, and the law itself. The dirigibles presented safety issues including fire, which occurred and builders ""realized how much worse that accident could have been"" (¶ @NUM1) Another safety issue was keeping the blimps stabilized, which would have needed free hanging weights over the city. Yet another obstacle was the power of nature; it would have been nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place. Because of the wind ""the back of the ship would swivel around... the mooring mast"" (¶ @NUM2). The new idea was a good one but the law also was against it, because of how low the blimp would be. As stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (¶ @NUM3). The masting moor of the Empire State Building caused too many obstacles for the project to be completed. Although it would have opened new doors for means of travel there were too many safety violation for it to be worth while."	4	3	4
16246	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were high wind currents, and an already existing law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas.The first reason dirigibles couldn't dock was because of overly powered wind currents on top of the Empire State Building. It was mentioned in paragraph @NUM1 that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 was being said here was that it would be unsafe for people if the dirigibles were going to dock near the Empire State during violent air currents.The other reason why dirigibles couldn't dock was because of the law saying they were against airships flying to low over urban areas. @CAPS1 this law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get to close to the area. It was said in paragraph @NUM2 that dirigibles did try to reach the building."" In December 1930 the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Since the dirigible was @CAPS1 big it couldn't get close enough because of sharp objects on other buildings.It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. All because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."	3	3	3
16250	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders went through obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock in the @ORGANIZATION1, the builders had to redesign the top of the Empire State Building. They had to make it taller and more suitable for the dirigibles to land. They went through problems because they were not sure if the dirigibles would fit. Second, the had to design the mast. The builders had to design a whole other part for the dirigible. The builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast. The builders faced that big obstacle. Third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle because the had glass and chrome-nickel stainless steal on the tower. The builders went through many obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, when in the end the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock The builders should ""Take a bow, because it's over now"""	2	2	2
16259	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first, it says the building's foundation will be more stress with a thousand-foot dirigible docking. For example ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The second, it says that it's really dangerous if they take place above the building. For example, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. ""@CAPS1, it says the winds on the top of the building are so strong. For example ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" In conclusion, they still face to many obstacles, so the idea which let the dirigibles dock on the top of the building is hardly become true. "	3	3	3
16260	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, is informant on the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building. The issue was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. To fix this problem, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature. The winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions. This hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a problem. The final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the Empire State Building. The excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders."	4	3	4
16261	6	During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel framed  balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realzed how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there.	3	2	3
16262	6	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacals when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would put stress on the buildings fam. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Theese are the obstacals they had to @ORGANIZATION1.	2	1	2
16283	6	The builders were Building about @NUM1 ft high Above surface, so Safety is an issue. Then a @NUM2 ft @CAPS2 would moore, at the top of Building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building (@CAPS2 load would). Also, The Wind pressure would have to be transmitted @NUM3 ft below to the foundation. So its a @CAPS1 that could affect @CAPS3. The @CAPS2 could catch on fire on top of Downtown New York hurting @CAPS3 And its costing a lot of money @NUM4 Dollars.	2	3	3
16284	6	Allowing the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building took some obstacles. First, there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on.Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all.	3	3	3
16288	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders faced quite a few problems. They faced on constructing the building. They didn't know if they could built it all. They also faced a bad climate, and faced on how much did the dirigibles weighted and if they can hold it. On paragraph fourteen it says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights."" These are a few things that the workers had to face"	1	1	1
16290	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend <@NUM1</@CAPS1> to modify the building's framework,""  I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with @MONEY1. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building. Overall, the idea of the mooring mast was just a very poorly planned the idea."	2	3	3
16291	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the @CAPS1 had to fix the frame of the building in order to transmit the stress of the dirigible to the bottom of the building. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the @CAPS1 had to complete the roof before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building also had to make sure that the mast's skeleton was made out of steel so that the mast looked like the rest of the empire State building and not stick out.	2	1	2
16300	6	Many obstacles faced the builders of Empire State Building. The biggest problem is The fact that it was illegal for a dirigible to fly that low in Urban areas, stated in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem was that most of the @ORGANIZATION2's dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flamable. So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3. Also fears of the sharp edges and forceful winds would cause the dirigible to get punctured and pop.	3	4	4
16316	6	The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire state faced was the lack of suitable landing area. The second obstacle that the builders of the Empire State faced was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The greatest obstacle to the succesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.	2	2	2
16324	6	"The builders faced multiple obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the Empire State Building, it ""would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The building would then have to be modified to meet these needs. Nature played as a big obsticle, as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe enviroment. Finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). These three main reasons prevented dirigibles from landing on top of The Empire State Building."	3	2	3
16329	6	"To the Empire State building did have a flat roof but they cannot just drop the mooring mast on top of the roof because it would add stressed to the frame. To build a mooring mast the cost would be more than sixty thousand dollars. Building a mooring mast would not be easy because the wind on top of the Empire state building would constantly change direction; therefore the dirigibles would be swirling around."" Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". Then there was a law that air craft should not fly too low over urban areas. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" For dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building had many obstacles."	3	3	3
16337	6	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced was many things surrounding safety and money issues. Successfully docking the dirigible would mean spending over @MONEY1 more, to make arrangements to the building. Also, there were many safety problems such as the gas the dirigible carried, the danger of people below in the city, and it was against the law for airships to be flying so low.	2	2	2
16344	6	"The obstacles The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced was a law That was against airships flying low over urban areas. The other problems the @CAPS1 of the Empire state building, faced was when The U.S. Navy driigble los Angeles approached The mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of force ful winds.     The first obstacle the @CAPS1 had faced in attempting to allow drigibles dock was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever fly up to a building The second Reason why the builder faced ob stacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock was in ""1930 U.S Navy drigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because forceful winds They @CAPS3 wind would blow dirigible to sharp spires. These are the obstacles the @CAPS1 of Empire State building faced to allow dockin."	3	3	3
16353	6	The obstacles, the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that Al Smith constructed 185 foot spire inside the building to make it taller. By @DATE1's the new airships called dirigibles was hailed as transportation for the future. They was like blimps but was filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter. In New york city they had a lack of Suitable landing area for dirigibles. Al smith add a mooring mast to the top of the building so they could tie the line from infront of the ship.	1	1	1
16359	6	The Mooring Mast has two obstacles @CAPS1 the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other reason dirigibles could not moor at the @ORGANIZATION1 law against airship flying too low over urban area. They try to get close but they can't because of forceful winds. In nineteen thirty the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles approched the mooring but not get close. So they stablish a low to a securit for a urban Area.	2	2	2
16369	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigible's weight was held by a single cable tether that ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was far below. If the cable tether were to ever break, passengers in the dirigible and civilians of New York would be in grave danger. This cable tether would be too risky to use. The builders could not possibly overcome nature and its ""violent air currents"" for the winds they the top of the building. These currents would cause docking to potentially be too time-consuming and dangerous. The builders and architects try to reverse this obstacle by weighing down ""the back with lead weights."" This was ""neither practical or safe,"" because of the potential danger of the weights falling and hitting New York pedestrians. The builders and architects of this grand project had to quarrel with many gargantuan obstacles in order to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
16371	6	Creating a mooring mast to sit atop the Empire State Building that would function and allow dirigibles to dock there was an incredibly challenging task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the extra weight and size of a mooring mast, architects had to work to redesign the frame of the whole building. The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimb from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was against the law for aircrafts to fly over urban areas, and that was the final obstacle that kept the mooring mast from being used.	3	4	4
16377	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles in the course of bringing Al Smith's plans to life. One of them was ""air ships flying too low over Urban areas"" is illegal. If breaking the law wasn't a large enough obstacle, then the issue of New York citizen's safety also came into play. Most dirigibles were dangerous due to their flamability. So one wrong move could have killed many ""if it had [exploded] above a densley populated area""Another huge obstacle the came into play was the lightness of the dirigibles, that would allow it's rear to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only way to stop that would to again, put the citizens in danger."	2	3	3
16382	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law.     Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over a populated areas such as New York City. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City.     Nature causes lots of obstacles inlife, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivil around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe.     There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped.     Saftey, nature, and the law kept Al @CAPS1 dream from coming true. These obstacles were the ones the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
16406	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, a lot of stress would be put on the building's frame with a thousand foot dirigible held to it, so the builders would have to make many modifications to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" @CAPS1, safety was a paramount reason as to why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there because of the highly flammable gas, Hydrogen that is used in most dirigibles. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS2, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents caused shifting winds, making the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, which wasn't safe for the pedestrians on the streets below. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose."	3	4	4
16418	6	When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem. The actual building was a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed.Safety is important, if one person dies per trip nobody is going to go on the ballon. Safety is important, no safety means no bussiniss. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. Maybe one day they will fix it.	2	2	2
16425	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The difficulty in having stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.      Wind was another obstacle that the builders had to overcome. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. And even if the dirigible were to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the led weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street."	3	3	3
16426	6	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quitely retired.	3	3	3
16429	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This means that any little spark inside the dirigible would send it up in flames. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents.' This proves that having the dirigible docked up there would be very dangerous and would call for weights to be used to anchor the back of the dirigible. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This symbolizes that it is against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area. The idea of docking dirigibles at the empire state building were ignored."	4	3	3
16455	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Because Al Smith wanted to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. The building's frame had to be modified before the construction of the mooring mast could begin because just putting on top would stress the frame and bring it down. Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. There was even a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areasThe builders had to work their way around. The biggest obstacle seemed to be safety for the people.	3	3	3
16456	6	In the process of building the empire state building the architects had many obstacles. One main obstacle was making the foundation strong enough. Another was the wind factor. They had many problems in the building of the Empire state building.In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire state Building they had to streghten, the whale foundation. If a dirigible docked before the whale building would twist and sway. Another problem was the wind. the wind coming off of other building would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed.Even though they faced many obstacles they successfully completed the Empire State Building	2	2	2
16473	6	"In the excerpt, ""The @CAPS1 Mast,"" by @PERSON1, the architects of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One of the problems the builders encountered was that the dirigible didn't have a suitable landing area. The architechs concluded that they couldn't just drop a @CAPS1 mast on top of their building, because it would add stress to its frame, so they had to strengthen, and modify it to make it work.Another obstacle. was the fact that most dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The builders realized how dangerous that could be, especially above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstace. Winds were constatly shifting due to violent air currents and they knew that this idea was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, There was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and unsuccessful."	3	3	3
16498	6	The greatest reason was one of safty: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violen air currents	2	2	2
16502	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the one obstacle to thier expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, also saw a opportunity for his Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on. Also dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. In conclusion, these are the obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced, to allow dirigibles to be docked.	1	1	1
16512	6	Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and laggage area. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below.	1	2	2
16523	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there. One of their obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen Not helium to stay in the air. If it blew up over New York the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. A second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was @CAPS1 high that there were strong wind currents. Making it difficult for the Navy's blimp the Los Angeles to come @CAPS2 the docking station at the mooring mast. Their final obstacle that they faced was the fear of the blimps going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire bursting a hole in the blimp: causing it to crash.The builders faced many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign blimp trying to dock and ends up blowing up since They are filled with hydrogen and not helium. Also since it is at such a high elevation the heavy wind currents make it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to be able to dock. Finally the fear of the blimp going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire puncturing a hole in the blimp causing it to crash.	3	3	3
16532	6	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, where at the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, and the most advanced form of @CAPS2. The Empire State building was erected to tether dirigibles and allow them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building constructors realized, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below,"" (para. @NUM1). Plans needed to be made to support the building and blimps. The nature also was conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles ""where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" (para @NUM2). Due to violent winds at the elevation these weights would waver the blimp and its weights. The aircrafts so were also at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" (para @NUM3). In addition a law for bid @CAPS2 from ""flying low in urban areas (para @NUM3). For these reasons the Empire State Building was never used for the docking of dirigibles."	3	4	4
16535	6	"There were a few challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't just be dropped on the top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton."" The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing."	3	2	2
16537	6	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accommodate this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the buildings frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the building's structure"	2	2	2
16544	6	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment.Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast.The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished.	4	3	3
16552	6	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building the workers overcome countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wants to build ""the world's tallest building"" (1). At the same time the Empire State building is being designer the @ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York, is finishing construction The @ORGANIZATION2 building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. The idea of the building for acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped. The Empire State Building *************** "	1	2	2
16555	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, having dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. There was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In addition to these obvious set-backs, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" However, it is safely said that mother nature herself proposed the biggest obstacle for the builders. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it extremely difficult to keep the dirigibles securely and safely hoisted to the building. The obstacles for the builders also became much more dangerous as they began to realize the science of the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", caught fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey the owners and builders of the Empire State Building realized that the accident could have been much worse if it happened on top of one of the most populated cities in the world."	4	3	4
16559	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigles to dock there was because the dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.	1	1	1
16563	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were that first, the mast designed to go ontop of the Empire State Building was thought up just to make it the worlds tallest building, not because it was necessary, so alot of problems ar ose. This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3	3
16570	6	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low."	2	2	2
16584	6	"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was saftey. For one reason dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is @NUM1 ft tall. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials. Also on the tethering to the mooring mast, would... ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" the idea was dangerous. To hold the dirigible to the building there would be lead weights, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast was the problems that the builders faced."	3	3	3
16588	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether."	4	4	4
16595	6	"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully."	4	4	4
16604	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in making a dirigible docking stations. One of the main things was that there was a law in place that banned the use of low flying aircrafts in urban areas, like New York City. Another reason is that it was just not safe to dock these massive blimps that high. Almost @NUM1 hundred feet up the winds would have been very violent, and with the tailend of the dirigible not being fastened down, it was very likely that it could get spun around and end up tangled with the mast. Also it was not safe because many foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen which was highly flamable, and if an- accident similar to the Hindenburg with fire occurred over in urban place like New York City it could have been very tragic. Lastly in order to build the mast builders had to re inforce the frame of the building so that it could bear the stress that such a station would put on the structure.	3	4	4
16608	6	When Designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the empire state Building there were @CAPS1 oBstacles that the @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 were faced with. One proBlem was they couldent @CAPS4 drop the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building Because it was too @CAPS5 for the frane of the Building. So Because of that proBlem The @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 had to come up with a way to modifey the frame of the Building so that the Building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem that they were faced with was that it was @CAPS4 too dangerous. I was deemed dangerous Because most dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen which was extremely flammable and they couldent @CAPS8 having @CAPS9 happend to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors aBove city streets that were crowded with people. So those Were @CAPS4 a few oBsticals that @CAPS2 were faced with when building the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building	3	2	3
16613	6	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One such obstacle that the builders had overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e. plains or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project were shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles."	3	3	3
16622	6	"An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 was weight. If the story it says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly @NUM1 feet below."" Another obstacle was nature. The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."""	2	3	3
17837	7	One day I was at basketball practice and I was running has  with my team when I was getting really really thirsty  do after we did are suicides (a running exercise)I asked coach if we could go get  some drinks  coach said “after are double drible down and back exercise” @CAPS1 I did the exercise and we all rushed to the drinking fountain and I was at the end of an @NUM1 girl  line .I waited and waited until finally there I was faced with that drinking fountain when one girl says “ can I have a drink thank you” and all I could do if be stunned..Thats were I heard a bright ladys lets go!” I was @CAPS1 mad but I quickly took a @NUM2 second drink of water and rushed over to coach and now I’m the fisst one alot and I take long drunks do my teammates call me a fish!	7	8	15
17840	7	There was a girl name @PERSON1. She loved spending time with her mom. Every weekend they would either @CAPS3 the movies, amusement or water park, or just stay home. This time was different though. @PERSON1 was even a little scared about @CAPS1 was about @CAPS3 happen. Today was a @DATE1 and @PERSON1 and her mom was watching videos of her mom when she was young. After the video, @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and laughed. Once they settled down, @PERSON1’s mom looked sad. “@CAPS1’s wrong mom?” @PERSON1 asked. “I have @CAPS3 go. I have @CAPS3 go somewhere for work and can’t take you with me,” mom replied. “@CAPS2 not?” asked @PERSON1. “I don’t know, but I need you @CAPS3 wait here with your father. I’ll be back soon,” the mom said calmly. With that @PERSON1’s mom left and drove away. @PERSON1 stood there confused and wishing her mom didn’t have @CAPS3 go. Then she went @CAPS3 the phone and called her dad. An hour later, @PERSON1’s dad came @CAPS3 her house. He calmed @PERSON1 down, who had been crying because she missed her mom. @PERSON1 went @CAPS3 her room and began  @CAPS3 wait patiently for her mom. Weeks past and @PERSON1’s mom still hasn’t returned. Every night now @PERSON1 cried hoping her mom would come. During the day she would wait watching for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now. Though see never complained @CAPS3 her father and understands that her mom left for an important reason, but still she missed her mom. Two years have passed since @PERSON1’s mom had left. @PERSON1 didn’t cry as much but still waited. Waited for her mother @CAPS3 come back. One day @PERSON1 heard a knock on the door, she answered it and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, then hugged each other. They both cried and her mom whispered “I’m sorry.” @CAPS3 @PERSON1. Now @PERSON1 and her were unseperatable. They never left each other’s side again.	11	12	23
17847	7	A time I was patient was @DATE1, when I was in line to ride the dragster in @CAPS1 point. I was super hot day, I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend and we were geting ready to get on the dragster. The line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you so to me it felt like forever. Just as we were about to go on the ride they steped us because the ride wasen’t working right. So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins. Luckly my best firend and I had good patients unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the most fun experences of my life. “I’m so happy we waited” said @PERSON1 my best firend. Some people have patient like  @PERSON1 and I, and some don’t like the the people who ran of there. I’m glade we waited or that would not have happened. In this case patient was a great thing for @PERSON1 and I.	9	8	17
17851	7	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Being patient is hard for some people but easy for others. I’m not a very patient person. I’ll tell about a time when I was patient. (the only time) One time me my mom and my sister we went to the docter because my sister had a docters appointment. I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said “about @NUM1 min.” @CAPS1 I said ok. @CAPS1 we arrived and she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no I’ll wait in the car. @CAPS1 I was inside of the car waiting and I got boare  and turned  the music on and this was ??? about @NUM2 or @NUM3 in. About @NUM4 later I got tired of listening to music. @CAPS1 I tried to fall asleep. That didn’t work @CAPS1 I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs were tight. It was @NUM5 and my mom and sister come walking. Thats a time I was patient.	8	8	16
17871	7	One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal.  As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain.’’ @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The dane’s rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6’s back turned.’’ @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. “@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased.’’ @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances.	12	12	24
17875	7	Their was a time when I was patient when I went to the barber shop and my family and I was going on a trip and I had to get my haircut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop was packed so the guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted. After those people were done he never call me up so he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me wait until he came out the restroom then five more people came in so that’s when my mom called my phone and asked me was I done because I been up their from @NUM1 to @NUM2 and she said go to some one else chair because was was about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick my stuff will be leaving at @NUM3 a.m the next morning.	7	5	12
17876	7	One @DATE1 week a couple of years ago my grandparents were over. We went to my @ORGANIZATION1’s sisters house and my @ORGANIZATION1 and aunt (my @ORGANIZATION1’s sister) were going to teach me hoe to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and the teacher wouldn’t do it for you. They said if I learned to tie my shoes I would get to pick something out at the dollar store so that got me all excited! When we got their after I had lunch they began teaching me. The tirck they taught me went like this: after you have the first crossover step you make the bop(tree) and you put the other string around it (the bunny loving around the tree. @CAPS1 you put it through (the bunny darling in its hole.) @CAPS1 you’re bond. After many tries was starting to get the hang of it. Later we went back to my house and my @ORGANIZATION1 kept helping me. Finally one afternoon I got it, my @ORGANIZATION1 was happy and she kept telling me good job. Later we went to the store and picked something out! My @ORGANIZATION1 had to be patient with me. She wasn’t getting all mad when I kept messing up she just kept being encouraging and patient. My @ORGANIZATION1 was patient and it helped me learn faster.	8	11	19
17901	7	Patience. I was patience when I had to baby sit. I rock him and play with him. I fed him, and walk him. He fell to sleep. My mom still is not home from work. I am going to be late to the movise with my cuzins. I play the game for @CAPS1. I look out the window walk out side and sat on the steps.mom still not there. My cuzins were out side.  Ask that to stay a little on gen. now hear came mom .I can go now.	6	4	10
17917	7	One time his years is seem a lay that was at the front of the lunch line and he was just about to go in but he had to go to the in because he wasn't all the way in the line. As he got sent to the in he had got mad but he went to the in but he was patient she didn't advice and next thing the new he was at the front of the line. I think that being patience mean when you are calm and you don't rush things and next thing you no you would be the next one	3	5	8
17924	7	"I was patient for a whole @DATE1. Although, that was only because @CAPS2 mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the wii. For @CAPS5 had just come and had me interested the first time I saw @CAPS5. @CAPS5 was comoletely doctor and had advanced graphics.  I had informed  @CAPS2 mother about this system immediately.  ""@CAPS1, I will buy @CAPS5 for you, considering your report card was exceptional."" @CAPS2 mother had guarenteed me.  ""@CAPS3! Thanc you mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting @CAPS2 hopes up and expecting @CAPS5 within  @CAPS6 weeks. Although I had done that only to later on dissapoint myself. @CAPS2 mother had informed us that I was to get @CAPS5 in between the time period of one to  the months. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" I had shouted. "" @CAPS6 months?""  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS6 months I don't have enough time to thank about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" @CAPS2 mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in @CAPS2 entire life. After appioximontly one and a half months of waiting, @CAPS2 mother had finally and, ""@CAPS9 are going to @CAPS10 today to buy your wii"""". At that very moment. I led nearly exploded from happiness. ""@CAPS3! "" @CAPS12 I had started in do a dance that no one understood not even  me. So when @CAPS9 pulled up to @CAPS2 favorite video game retail store, I was so excited  I couldn't sit still.  ""@CAPS13 down! Geez, @CAPS5's just a video game system!"" I @CAPS12 stopped immediatly. ""That's what you @CAPS14."" I mumbled to myself. When @CAPS9 had returned home, I had kept playing until @TIME1. So that is when I learned  @CAPS5 pays off when your patient."	12	12	24
17943	7	Ok, ink to start o yeah this is the good one once mom no no one day no ok some years some time back I had to be patient for my phone and it was my first phone I how to be good. It was band new phone it just came out and I had to have if I nid a lot around the house and school to my mom said I can get it next week and I was dertmined to get it so the next week @NUM1 im so happy but she said next week @DATE1. Im just doing what I was doin what I was saposd to be doin and on that @DATE1 I was so happy I got in trouble and I still got paid for doin my house work did not have at some did some help with the next door people and got some more and got the phone that take a long time but that. That is my patient story.	4	6	10
17959	7	Patient is very hard when your waiting for something you want. Very hard when your waiting in a line that is very loud or when you order something on the internet and you have to wait only two or three days. If your not a patient person that cant wait for the simplest thing that will only take a while then your a very impatient person that cant wait. If you are a impatient person then you are selfish, mad, and evidently not patient.	4	3	7
17966	7	One time when my family went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, we had to wait in line for the one roller causter I sayed witch one it was. Well I wasn’t as patient as my sister, but I was pretty patient. After the ride I had forgotten how long it took to get to go on the ride. My parents remember they thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere. Well there are many other times I have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my @CAPS2.  She had just gotten her @CAPS2 touch and she wanted to put music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my @CAPS2 too. Well I said yes. Even though I know I can’t spend a day without using or just looking at my @CAPS2. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said that the composer was taking forever and her infer were on it like forever.	8	10	18
17974	7	Crash. Boom! Oh no theres a accident. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 traffic stops. “we cant stop. not now,”  yells my younger sister.” I m gonna be late for dance class. Oh @PERSON1 just be patient this traffic will be moving before you know it.” I said. As minutes passed @PERSON1 has to go to the bathroom. My mom tells her she has to go to the bathroom. My mom tells her she has to wait but she replies, “I don’t want to wait.” I sat and look out the window silently because that’s all I really could do. @PERSON1 screams,” I have to go to the bathroom.” ”@PERSON1, I said please just be patient.” I gave her a candy that just only shut her up for a couple of minutes. @NUM1 minutes passed and sister is fast asleep .I asked mom when does she think the traffic is going to blow over. She told me she have no @NUM2 minutes later the traffic starts to move but stops then starts to move again. Finally we arrived to our exit and my sister makes it to the dance class. She got out of the car dashed into the studio .That was a time I was patient.	8	9	17
17983	7	Have you ever learn spritarnt just one turns in your life. I have let ??? you about it. One day I was at home watching too .all of a sudden I had to use the bathroom really bad. Unfortunately they my momma and my sisters had to go. My momma went first and my sister was going next. My momma didn’t take very long but my sister was in there while and I was getting mad but l still was waiting patiently. It was holding it in but I knew eventually I new that it was going to come out eventually, but just waiting. I was doing all I can to get in  the bathroom. I was banging on the door trying to just the back and I wait in the bathroom and handled my business. In conclusion, this is a time that I was patient.	8	10	18
17988	7	The time when i was patient was when christmas came aroud. At first i just wanted christmas to get here. But my mom told me I had to just wait and  that it will come soon. So I waited and waited because I really wanted a wii consle and the sims @NUM1. So finally when christmass came i got what i wonna and some. Usually @CAPS1 not that patient but the reason I was is becaused my mom told me that it will come soon. I learned that when you really want something or really want to do something the more patient you are the faster it will come.	8	7	15
17993	7	My brothers checkup was today, why did I come? All I did was sit patiently for @NUM1, there was nothing I could do @CAPS1 I kept my cool. Waiting there in a dark room was hard, I picked up a near car magazine and started flipping through it, @CAPS1 the interesting thing was a article about a new @CAPS2 coming out. I read that in @NUM2 I went to the bathroom, and really soon was back in the wasteland of darkness. I whipped out my phone and texted a couple people. Five minutes passed and answer no I close my eyes and layed my head back so I waited and waited. Right when I was about bash my head on a brick wall my brother enters the room and says “ That’s it “.And then I got a text by two people, it would have been better while I was board out of my mind!	9	8	17
17998	7	There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person.	9	8	17
18023	7	Supper beast patience I was coming here from school are day on the  going bus so @CAPS1 what felt live  @CAPS2 I finals got have I ran inside I saw my high school bro with a box of pop I asked  blare here did you set the mong  for that is allows need mong . You wouldn’t ques what he said I took it out of ur walles .I yelled what I have ben holding that in there so I could go to the movies. As  I thought with ma ??? @NUM1 sade was friends. So I ren aut vumpt in the arr purched him right in the nose .It starts bleding .I try to run he grass ???. He could real me at each time. But he said I‘ll pay back when he let me so. I thought now he is so patient with me, he could of killed me and he didn’t??? next week he save me ??? back and he last hit me sence .	4	8	12
18033	7	A time when I was patient was when I went to sedar point. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and it was a long ride. When we got there it was a long line to get in. My mom said “all right guies time to be patient”. Once we got in we went to the first rid we seen. It also had a long line. Mom said “we are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the rides”.	5	7	12
18044	7	Patience. My cousin ??? most patient person I have ever met. @LOCATION1 is studying to be a doctor, he must go through eight years of college. Eight years of termanology, teaching cells, learning human anology he has to be patient. My cousin goes to @ORGANIZATION1 which is pretty close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home a lot and never complain about homework or school or anything has got the highest patient ??? trust me. He is the perfect role model. Romeo is on his fifth year of college which means four down four to go. He doesn’t have a certain way of taking stress out besides the fact he squeezes his??? It’s not easy being motivated and relaxed ??? does that. Before he left for @ORGANIZATION1 he told me patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo is patient.	8	8	16
18057	7	The place I was paitent it was at my mom’s doctor appointment. It was a little healthcare place at @LOCATION1 road and it was small and I had to wait out at the lobby and it was boring.

18070	7	This story is about chicken hand the fox and a time he had to be patient. Let me set the scene, clung the scourge sends chicken hound and his mother, @PERSON1, to be boiled. They were both supposed be killed and thrown in the ditch. But chicken hound had only blached out. When he awoke he realized his situation and knew that he would have to wait until dark to get to @CAPS1 wall and waited although insects had snowded on him. Finally when the cover of night came he rolled in the mud to prevent any further blood loss and began his journey. That is when chicken hound had to be patient.	9	11	20
18092	7	One of my storys of being patient is this one time was at my uncles nonse and I wanted to play the tboy @NUM1. Well the was like five other kids to and I asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient. So I sat there and waited like for a hour or two atleast it felt like it and I didn’t say a word about it the whole time, then I finally got to play. That’s my story about being patient.	9	7	16
18097	7	A time when I was patient was when I ordered a @CAPS1 in the mail. It was a cool @DATE1 @TIME1, and I was ordering a @CAPS1 online. When I got to the shipping, I paid it, and went to the check-out screen. I saw the time of how long it would take to get to my house. It said @NUM1 weeks.”@CAPS3?!”I exclaimed.”That’s a long time.”@CAPS4 it was decided. I had to make through @NUM1 weeks. I was ready. @CAPS4 I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Until one @DATE2 I saw a @CAPS1. The address said “@CAPS6 @CAPS7”! I was @CAPS4 happy! This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, you’ll get @CAPS3 yar wanting in the end.	9	8	17

18124	7	It was the night before @CAPS1 eve and I couldn’t hardly wait. In @CAPS5 family on @CAPS1 eve we go to @CAPS5 grandparents house. When we are there we talk, eat, and @CAPS5 favorite open presents. As @CAPS5 mom, dad, and I drove up to @CAPS5 grandparents house I couldn’t open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the door bell a hundred times. “@CAPS3 hello there, @CAPS4” @CAPS5 grandpa said. “@CAPS6, can we eat fast so I can open @CAPS5 presents?” “yah, sure.” @CAPS7 we were done eating I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I couldn’t wait. As I waited patiently until all of @CAPS5 old relatives opened their presents it was finally @CAPS5 turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw what it was a game. Since it was the first present I had to open it fast but from then on I waited paitently until it was @CAPS5 turn.	8	7	15
18126	7	I saw someone @CAPS1 patient the got to a rest runt before I did and den I orderd my food and it came. They done sill had no food so I left and finally they got the food now that’s what I call patiants.	4	2	6
18129	7	A time that I was patient is when I had my twelth birthday. All of my friends exept one, wanted to keep playing. So we did. We desited to go and walk the dogs, and then have dinner, and then open presints. When we were all done with that, we opend my presints, I was very excited to see them. That is a time that I was patient. I was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first. Pluss in the end, I got a lot of exiting stuff and I relized that wating, and doing what my friends wanted to do first was a great idea. I’m pretty schure that we all had a great time.	7	6	13
18166	7	“@CAPS1 @CAPS2” said my little sister @PERSON1 “@CAPS3 you help me practice kicking a soccer ball we are doing it in gym and I @CAPS6’t know how.” “Of corse” I said “lets go to the back yard” @CAPS4 my way out I grab a ball. I set it down @CAPS4 the ground in the front of me and say “@CAPS5 you do is step forward with you left foot and kick with the top of you right. “ I’ll try @CAPS8 say” daughtfully. @CAPS8 runs up to the ball an kicks, he misses but thats @CAPS7. @CAPS8 trys againe another miss. @CAPS8 sits down @CAPS4 the ground. I go up to her. “@CAPS6’t give its only your second try, not everyone is good at soccer try one more time. “@CAPS7, one more try.” @CAPS8 runs up to ball and kicks. The ball goes sailing into the goal. “@CAPS9 you for teaching me @CAPS2.” “I was my pleasure just try to be patient with yourself and you’ll be a great soccer player I promes.” “@CAPS7 but I want to practice some more.” “@CAPS7.”	8	9	17
18179	7	Patience is eporten. Becus if you don’t haf patience you wont git that far in lif. If you don’t haf patience pepol wunt lak you at all. And yeu don’t haf patience you wont be abl to fis stuf.	3	2	5
18182	7	My name is @CAPS1 and I’m writing about a time I had be patient. It was a nice @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE2 it was the eighteenth and we were going to drive down to @LOCATION1 for a vaction we were going to  @CAPS2 land. Everybody was up in the house hold packing every thing into a hammer that we rented for the trip so every one would fite into the car. We had packed all things into the car. My made us a good breakfast. A hearty meal of sasauge pancakes and bacon and scaldded eggs. It was delicouse. After that we got into the car and we were on the highway I had fell a sleep a hour into the drive. By now it was ten acloak at night and I woke back up. My sister was yelling at my brother and then me and my sister got into a urgement my told all of use to be quited and we did but we were all get on each other nerves. And I had to be patient for another two day but we got there and I was glad to be there so overall it was a funture till we had to go back.	8	9	17
18202	7	One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and lisksent through difficultis without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day end at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that ment the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasn’t coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a bird’s eye  of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. Finally,, he got a ride. Each ride got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience.	9	12	21
18208	7	I was patient when I was going to cedar point. We took a bas it took seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided in watch movies on the @CAPS2. We watched street dreams and the incredible. We were still a long way from cedar point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilerious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait now longer. This helped in my future.	8	9	17
18245	7	Some people are patient. Others are not. Some have short attention spans.  Patience is a person who is understanding and tolerant. They experience difficulties without complaining. Some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something. They are not patient. There is a saying that goes, patience is a virtue. Many have heard of that. Patience is waiting for @NUM1 hours in line to see a movie and not having to move around. Patience isn’t pacing back and forth. Being patient in problems is fine.	4	5	9
18249	7	When I think of being  patient I think about the time I went to southrend @LOCATION1 for hockey, we were on the road for @NUM1 ½ hours! While  we were on the way there i didn’t say one thing about how much longer or anything, although I was on a claster bus with all my hockey friends wathing a hockey movie. When I think of patients I think of wating without asking  “@CAPS1 it done yet?’’ or “Are we there yet?” I myself dont have the best patients. when I want the computer or to role the guard or frarwheeler and someone was on those things I tend to ask “when will he be dane!” alot. Patients grows with you when you develop, as you get older you will be able to wait longer times without getting stressed out about how everything takes so long even this test takes patients!	6	7	13
18252	7	One time. My cousin in patient because she was going to the mouie @CAPS1 a party. @CAPS1 it was a lot of kids at her house @CAPS1 she had to clean up the house before her mom come home. Also @CAPS2 that day she called our entire mom but they didn’t pick up @CAPS2 she hurry up @CAPS1 tried to clean before he boyfriend came over. Then she hurry up @CAPS1 get in the tub then got out put the the kids @CAPS1 the  tub. She still had to clean up then she us what to clean up. @CAPS2 she rush out the @CAPS1 left us there while go get us something to eat @CAPS2 we clean up while. She is gone. Then she called me and said. I ‘m on my way with food I said oh. Next her boyfriend came @CAPS1 he ready to go. She came back the house was clean. Then her mom came home @CAPS2 went in the room in change he clothe s her mom said where a going. She said to the mouie and a party her moma said no you not go clean up the bathroom first she got mad and said moma   I been in  patien all day I ‘m ready to go. @CAPS2 she wash it go @CAPS1 then they left.	6	8	14
18266	7	One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didn’t see anything but we weren’t going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn’t hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie.	12	9	21
18267	7	Patience can really help you in life some times it’s the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important. Just like how my dog ran away and I’m waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you'll get in a sitchation were your waiting for someone but there is always only one choice, to wait or be patient.	6	5	11
18271	7	When my brother, my dad and my two cousins got out of the car from the @NUM1 hour drive from @LOCATION1, we knew would have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller @CAPS1 galore. I saw at cedar point, the amusement park. In the car we talked about the @CAPS1.  The maverick, milleniur force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the mentis. When I walked in, I knew this way going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go a back later. As the day goes on we go almost of the @CAPS1. As we approach the @CAPS4 we see at least @NUM3 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrive at the @CAPS2 the line was bigger then the start of the day. We discussed and decide it's not getting any smaller and go on the ride. About a later a @NUM4 years guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and deserved the wait. This is how I was patient and leard waiting leads up to good things.	8	12	20
18295	7	One day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told and security took us back to the end of the line. We where mad and my dad was losing his patients too. We wait for hours till it was finally our turn. We wait that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time l lost my patients.	8	8	16
18317	7	It was the day of central @LOCATION1 and it was after school that I was in the paraid with my football team and the line was going really slow and eventally we have done and it was off the home with my best friend @PERSON1. Well his preparing me and I went to his house and played a little and then we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1’s there were about @NUM1 cars and they were all in the drive through and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game didn’t start until @NUM2 and it was @NUM3. So we sat there patiently and ordered are food and left to go to the football game. And that’s a time when I was patient.	8	8	16
18324	7	It was a nice sunny day outside, in the middle of the @DATE1. It was so hot outside, it was like the sahara desert. “honey get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,” my mom shouted out the window. “@CAPS1 mom,” I questioned.”it’s a suprice”she answered. So I did what she told me while wondering where @CAPS9 were going. When @CAPS9 got there, I knew exactly where @CAPS9 were. @STATE1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. “@CAPS3 going to go on @CAPS4 @CAPS5, want to come,” I asked my mom. “@CAPS6, sounds like fun she replied.” When @CAPS9 got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. “@CAPS7, I don’t want to wait mom, its too long of a line,” I complained. “@CAPS8 patient, sweety @CAPS9’ll @CAPS8 on the coaster in no time,” she replied. One hour later……… “mom its taking forever.” I whimpered. “@CAPS9 are the next ones in line,” she replied still smiling. So when the gates opend i was so excited and nervous, I couldn’t believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. “You were very patient,” my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. “@CAPS6 I was, and @CAPS3 proud of that,” I said to myself.	12	12	24
18355	7	Patience is a hard but good thing to have because patience can help you progress in your life such as getting a job. One way you would have to be patient when trying to get a job is when the boss is ??? your ressence aterring his sweet time. You don’t want to get impatient and yell at him and tell him to hurry up because that would make you not get the job. So in conclusion patience is a good like skill to have because it can help our progress in life.	4	3	7
18357	7	I’ve been to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 before, my family and I went about a year ago. Their were so many rides! we were astounded of how many people were  their. My family and I decided to go on the little rides first. We went on things like the “ @CAPS2 trap”, “@CAPS3 star”,. Also many water rides. At the end of the day, my family and  I walked in line to the biggest ride their. It was called the “@CAPS4 timbers.” The track was made out of wood, thats what made most of the ride scary to. Their was line of prolly @NUM1 people. I told my mom I didn’t want to wait long. She said “you need patience”  I said ok fine ! It was the ride, it was pretty fun .After we got off I said “mom that patience really paid off”.	8	8	16
18363	7	There are @NUM1 different languages in the world and different??? of these languages, in all that is  more than @NUM2 different languages. But in each language patient means the same thing, understanding and tolerant. Everyone had to be patient at one point or another, let me tell you??? one time were I was patient. It was just about one week ago when I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day I realized that we were both. I sent her e-mails, text messages, and I called her cell phone and home phone at least @NUM3 times @CAPS1 didn’t answer or reply. I got even more frustraited the more @CAPS1 ignored me, then I talked to my cousin about it. “You have to be patient with her, this is your first fight.”@CAPS1 told me in a calm voice. so, I waited by the phone to see if @CAPS1 meassaged me back without using  swear words, and I left her alone at school. Finally, one day @CAPS1 talked to me. @CAPS1 said “I’m sorry too, thanks for being patient with me. I’ve missed hanging out with you, how about we sit together at band?” “I’d life that.” replayed and finally made up after five days of fighting. After experience I learned that being patient   pay off. So wait your turn @NUM3 speak, and understand why people say what they say and mean what they mean. Patience is always the hey.	12	12	24
18368	7	Once apani time there were to kids one was name @CAPS1 he wasn’t patience at all. The other kid was name @PERSON1 he be was patience. They went for a walk in the woods and get lost @CAPS1 would not stop complaining. @PERSON1 told him stop complaining @CAPS3 @CAPS1 didn’t until he say a hunted house @CAPS1 told @PERSON2 want to go inside with him. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 didn’t want to go in so @CAPS1 went in and act like he got hurt so @PERSON1 ran in there the dorslamd shut and the door nob feel off. They were scared it was dark. Then the light came on. @CAPS1 said lets get at of here! @PERSON1 said how the door nob fell off. @CAPS1 said I don’t know they ran though the house there wore no other door or windows the were terrify then a ghost was coming at them and he said happy @CAPS7 it was there dad he built the house for them and said all you had to do is push the door open. and they all went home. the end	7	8	15
18379	7	I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off.	7	4	11
18381	7	"@CAPS4 I'm patient, and sometime I'm impatient. But no matter how impatient l am, my @CAPS5's even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs at the long delay, sighs, and gets very impatient. He says things like, @CAPS1 on, @CAPS2"" ""@CAPS1 on!""  @CAPS4 it's scary to be with @CAPS5 in traffic jams, or long lines. But after the long line. @CAPS5's himself again which is a great relief on my past!"""	12	8	20
18383	7	A time that I was patient was when I was fighting my little brother in @LOCATION1 and then he kicked me in the chin and I promised him that I would not tell on him even when I busted my chin open the second time he kicked me and I fell to the ground right in front of everybody else and then I was being swarmed like a bunch of bees around a hive full of honey. That was when I was being patient.	5	6	11
18423	7	I play hockey. I am a goalle. A good goalle is always paitient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalle faced lots of @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots. Most of the @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots didn’t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on @NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it.	10	8	18
18430	7	One time I had to be really patience. It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs.	10	9	19
18433	7	The time I needed patience. We were on the groccery store, @CAPS1 man to be exact.m When we first got there I was exited because we were going to get lots of junk bad, but ther. We started to get lots of food and it looked really good. I started to just eat it all. The cart was half way. ??? @CAPS7 we got more stuff and it was @CAPS3 full that we had to get another cart and it started to get hungry. But the time we were in the meat section, I was starving. My mom said “@CAPS2 me just get a couple one things.” @CAPS3 I waited, and waited @CAPS7 she told me to go to checkout. All of them were @CAPS3 long and I felt like I was ???(@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6) @CAPS7 this little girl walked up to me getting smart I couldn’t take it, I was about to talk that little girl down. But I had to calm myself @CAPS3, @CAPS7 I realized it was our turn and I was @CAPS3 happy. @CAPS7 when I got home mom cooked bacos and I was just ready to go to bed.	11	8	19
18454	7	Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentist’s office. This @DATE1, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was waiting to be called in, a boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older women came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girl’s tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth. I didn’t it was fair that I had to wait another @NUM1 minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didn’t mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be manditory.	12	12	24
18473	7	I am going to tell a story in my own way. It was @DATE1. My sister was turning @NUM1 years old. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “You have wait”. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s @CAPS3 slow,” @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, “@CAPS4 up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. That’s my story I told in my own way.	12	12	24
18501	7	The @CAPS1 out in @DATE1. One day when my aunt @PERSON1 was watching me and all of a sudden all the lights went out. So I thought we blew a fuse so my aunt @PERSON1 and she went to go fix it and it didn’t work so she ??? calling my mom and he connection got lost so then we got our generator and watched the news and my mom got stuck in the highway ??? I was worried so the we finally got our phones to work and some of are family came and we were so mad cause nothing worked for a week and we had to be very patient.	5	4	9
18507	7	My finger tips were icy as I sat and wanted. The seconds tarried into minutes, turned into hours. My body heat escaping rapidly like sand in the winds. I frudged through the mud as the slick rain hammed on my skin. I should have waited. I was patient as they explained it. But I didn't listen. I should have waited. I should have waited, wait have I shoulded. The words mixed together. My bones cold, I was only about @NUM1 yards from home. My legs refused to walk as they shuddered violently. Wait, be patient, I reminded myself. A cop car in my parents' driveway. I shoved my left leg through the mess of leave and mud, patience wasn't a factor right now. Nine yards, eight, seven, six. I stopped, pulled my poud over my head but the wind and paid blew it off again, five, four, three, two, one. I was at my door step. I weakly raised my hand to knock. The @CAPS1. Fast foot steps, the door opens. I am showered with hugG. ''You should have waited!'' my dad cried, tears streaming down his face. I smiled weakly.	10	12	22
18509	7	Have you ever heard your mom or dad say patience is a virtue. Well I’ve heard it many times in my house actually too many times. Patience is a something that means you have to wait like when you wanna go see a new movie on opening night, you might have to wait in a big line cause it’s a new movie. So your gonna have wait with patience!	5	6	11
18518	7	Once before I went to @CAPS1 point with my friend @PERSON1. I was patient on the way there. I was patient in line to get inside. I was patient in line to get on the dragster. I was patient to go on all the rides. Once I had to go to the hospital to get an echo on my heart. I was patient waiting for my results. I am always patient. Well most of the time. Once I went to @LOCATION1, I was patient to go through security. I was patient on the plane waiting to get there. I was patient to get off. I was patient for my luggage. I have to go to school. I am patient waiting to  lunch. I am patient for school to be over. I am patient to wait till class is over. Like I said I am mostly patient.	6	6	12
18520	7	@CAPS1's cold @CAPS1's raining, I'm wet @CAPS1's been @NUM1 hour and still no activity. All I have to do is wait. I'm hunting deer hitting with my new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 bow. I'm a decent shot but not that good. I know patients is the key to deer hunting so I will just have to wait. I now see a deer about @NUM2 yard away and shoot @CAPS1 so my patience pays off	9	10	19
18526	7	When I have patient is when I go out to eat. So no one can speat in, my food. Like one time I went out to eat with my family. And we all was dress alike for my birthday. So I ask my daddyto tell them that my birthday is to day. And I wanted a piece of cake now. So he want to tell what I said and they ??? give us a minute. So I waited and waited. And finly said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place brun down. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. So they finly bring my cake. And they sang happy birthday to me. And I was happy after that in tell I found out they speat in my food and ate itto. I had found out because before I lifte I heard some people talking about how they speat in my food. Then I said wait did you in the fries they said yea. Then I said o I don`t care cause I didnt eat the fries. They said why I because I the fries is neasty. And I rolled my eyes and walked away. But I don`t  do that because I scared somebody would do it again. That is why I have patience.	8	8	16
18535	7	I remember when I wanted to ride my dirt bike and my dad was busy and I waited till he had time to put gas in it. When @PERSON1 wanted to ask a question he had, but he had to wait and then asked the question	6	4	10
18559	7	One time @CAPS1 mom took a test to become a @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients. I understoond because I get that feeling when I’m waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This is a time @CAPS1 mom showed patients for three whole days!	9	10	19
18561	7	In third grade one day it was one of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world.	11	8	19

Anyway he used to be a cop and had a shotgun so we went out and tried it. It didn’t work out. I missed every single bird I clay targets jet actped one. I only got one bb through the thing. But I was cool with it I new I was bad because it was the first time. So we tried the hit the thing died center. I feelt shown up.

It said @NUM4, “I said,” @CAPS1 only been @NUM5 minutes. So I started to play a game and I forgot about the xbox @NUM1. My dad said that we were going shopping to get my x-box. I’m like, wow did it fly by. I guess if you don’t think about it and be patient it will be over in no time.	7	8	15

My mom was driving me to school and she said “When I pick you up today I have surprise for you at how.” @CAPS1 that whole day I had to be patient but I couldn’t I just had to get home to see what is was .I could have pretended I was sick and went home but I decided to just calm down and be patient .

18678	7	The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you don’t ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you don’t get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you don’t get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you don’t get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosn’t pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something that’s a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because, if you maybe wan’t to have a job as a theropist you need a lot of patients. Those are some definitions of patients.	5	6	11
18693	7	Every day I must be patient in difficult things. I must be most patient when I am playing or watching sports. Every weaken my brother play in a play football league and it can bewaring. I have to bit almost two hours for the games to be over and my parents make me wat in the game. My favorite speed is football and since I am a first base man and an eat fields; I have to wait of the ball to ??? so that  I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the meap because it is a long so and I must wait until people are we done. As you can see, I am very patient are have to be in many situations.	6	6	12
18707	7	As I sit in the waiting room at @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 waiting and waiting for my grandpa to come to thee recovery room. I think to myself what if something went wrong or what if he doesn’t make it through the surgery. Then I say to my @CAPS3 “can we see grandpa now”, she said “@CAPS4 just be patient everything will be just fine if you sit relax and for hevan sakes,” “be patient!” “@CAPS5” I say to my @CAPS3. After an hour passed, I had gotten on say so I thought in my self and said to myself cahlem and patient, calm and patient. Then this lady come out to the waiting room and said “the surgery was a little longer than we expected but everything went perfectly fine but he will be staying in the hospital for a week an a half at the most “which was perfectly fine with me as long as I was get out of this boring hospital and as soon as I said I had my mom said as soon as grandpa gets to the recovery room we will go see him then we will leave!	8	12	20
18726	7	Being patient is important, as I’ve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldn’t get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1’s house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friend’s birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldn’t fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards.	12	8	20
18737	7	Patience I understand is the and tolerant patient people experience difficulty with ??? Today wy will mean were patience his ?? US today. ?? with a ?? tim ??? samh is and infront today she is ??? doing the ??. But she ?? an ho). ur ??. ?? she ???(@CAPS1	8	7	15
18753	7	In my opinion, I am a very inpatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something , they’d better stop it on the spot or @PERSON1 I rate, child makes a huge breakthrough, also, I am not one of those kids who waits for dinner, I snack my way to it! and when I am at school, I just @CAPS1 listening to meap instructions for hours on end. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy.! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage! Overall I think people need more patience these days.	5	5	10
18758	7	One day when I was walking put side I found a snake on a rock. I yelled for my big brother who was playing his game. He said” hold on I need to beat the leavie “ but the snake was getting eratatid sot said,” now garrid its leaving finally after ten minutes he came out of the house and stared at what was in my hand. He asked me “why do you have a snake “I re plied “I saw it cool.” he liked I and let it go.	5	8	13
18759	7	"One night, when me, @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister, @PERSON1, were asleep. Our parents were on the computer. @CAPS4 usually don't stay up that late. So I just thought @CAPS2 was doing something for work. In the @TIME1, when we wake up, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen with smiles on their faces. @CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. ""I wonder @CAPS3 it could be…."" I thought. I asked @CAPS9 mom ""@CAPS3's going on!?!"" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowely brought up a document from behind his back presenting it to us. The heading on the document said ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8."" @CAPS9 parents were smirking @CAPS11 @CAPS9 sister and I stared at each other in amazement. @CAPS11 if we were reading each other's mind, we both well knew that we were going on a cruise! I grinned excitedly and looked at the @CAPS15 on the paper. ""@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2.'' it said. Today was @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2 ""That's like, two months away!!!.""  ""@CAPS10,"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, ""you must be patient."" @CAPS11 normal kids did. I said ""@CAPS12…"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 knew @CAPS9 disappointment and said ""@CAPS14 things come to those who wait. I nodded contently. I knew that I was going to have to rough the two months out and be patient. The first couple weeks felt like mont's to us. We were oh so anxious @CAPS11 you would guess. But, @CAPS11 time progressed the patient got easier. I was able to focus on other things beside the cruise. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, the time come for us to head on a plane for the cruise."" That quick! It went by that quick! I m so excited, @CAPS2! I said when we were boarding the plane. ""I'm proud of you, son. You we're patient!"" That's the time of how I learned to be patient! @CAPS11 @CAPS9 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS14 things will come to those who wait."""	11	12	23
18767	7	Patient day. I remember the time when I was patient for a toy car. Four @CAPS1 I hate to waent for @NUM1 whole days. Each day it felt like I was in jail. So I was getting mad each day slaping people in the face it was so funny so my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was mad at me. then my mom put me on punishment. Then couple days later I was dooing good in school. So my mom was so proud of me. Then she bout me a lot of stuff. Later that chirstmas day we had turkey ranch dressing. Then I open my presents. I got the toy car, @NUM2, monster truck cars shoes and @ORGANIZATION1’s blue, red, @CAPS4 any collars you can think of. So that is why I was patient that toy I was so happy and my @CAPS5 stop by and gave me @NUM3 dallers. Then he took me ice @CAPS6 shade to were these skinny tites. But it all worked out for me at the end. I got every thing I wanted and I want a load touch with the @NUM3 @CAPS7. It felt like I was rich for chirstmas day.	6	7	13
18774	7	When your at a store or the doctor or anywhere where you have wait for something you always have to have patience or you wiil never be able to do anything. I remember when i was at the store with my mom we had to wait in this long  line just to buy a few groceries but if didn’t  have patience we would put are stuff back and went back home but sense we did  have patience we got to buy are stuff. That why, if you dont have you won’t be able to do anything you wanna do.	8	8	16
18779	7	Yo! I’m the narrator… you know the dude that tells the story, well I’m gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 being the smart @CAPS1 he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!	10	8	18
18783	7	I  am patient  every  even  this  year  for  @CAPS1 so  I can get  some  @CAPS2. I was buying  @CAPS2  but  I can’t buy  any more  because   @CAPS1 is  coming up  that  why I half to be  patient because it will seen longer  if  I keen getting excited.    Every day  is  patient sometimes I can’t wait to  get  out  of  school so  I can  play. I’m always trying to be patient because it’s one holiday after another each one gets more exiting.  Every kid tries but being patient is one of the most hard thing to do.  How I’m patient is I act like nopthing  exciting  is even comimg up.	4	5	9
18793	7	Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old I was extremely patient about an @CAPS1 toy I wanted. Ever since @CAPS1 The @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 bender was on television and In stories now I was crazy about them and I still am today the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 the only person in the @CAPS1 world who can master all four element @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 . Now I can write you a whole entire book about the @CAPS1. So I saw a @CAPS1 had set on t.v. so I asked my mom could she buy it. And she said when I get the money, but until then no. so of course I was upset. So I was waiting counting until the days went buy. Then final that very @CAPS12 came, and you know what that means. “@CAPS11 @CAPS12” the @CAPS12 has arrived the @CAPS12 I get my toy but I didn`t know that she only got two hundred dollars so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up steair and locked my door and cryed myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the @CAPS12 and when my birthday was here can guess what…? I finally got the best of all. The @CAPS4 and my mom said that all that patients you did got what you wanted.	12	12	24
18806	7	A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at @ORGANIZATION1 vaction. I was having a blast. My family didn’t come because they don’t like roller coasters. We dicided to ride the @CAPS1, it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the @CAPS1. We really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth waiting @NUM1 and a half hours @ORGANIZATION1 it and we even went on it twice.	8	12	20
18808	7	Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well being patient is something you need in life. I’m going to tell you a little bit about being patient. (@NUM1) patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need for when we go shoping, or when your in the car. You must be patient when you are in the car because if you don’t then you could get into an accident. Patience has many qualities. If you aren’t patient when you are place then you are going to become annoying. When their are long lines or something and your not patient people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you. (@NUM2) being patient is important. If you have kids your impatient, then your going to teach your kids to be impatient. That’s not a good thing. As you can see I have told you as much as I can about patience.	5	7	12
18815	7	Sometimes being patient is hard @CAPS5 I’ve had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I’ve always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see @CAPS3 my presents @CAPS5 their were none. My mom was just watching @CAPS1.V. like nothing was important and I said to her, “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 she said back was “@CAPS2, why are you up this early?” I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, @CAPS5 nothing. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until @NUM1, just waiting for someone to say “happy birthday” @CAPS5 yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until @NUM2: pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient I got a good party and now I’m patient every day.	9	8	17
18823	7	Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.	9	7	16
18864	7	Aplause  filled the building after the first dance ended. I was back stage with my dance team going over routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crouded and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform and it was at least five hours long. “@CAPS1 many more dances?” and “what dance are we on?” @CAPS2 what everyone had on there mind or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on excited bored and nervous. Then finally it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting  that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing. Great things take patience!	12	9	21
18891	7	Patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something . Some people can be very, very patient. But other people have no patient at all. Like if your waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of thing an your in a bit of a rush. Now yo could be rude and yell, him or her scream and all that crazy mess or you could wait patient and maybe she will let you cut. That’s what patient is to me.	8	4	12
18892	7	Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you.	8	9	17
18897	7	It was @DATE1 and @PERSON4 was in class messing around at his desk like usual. @PERSON4 isnt usually the patient kind of a person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and @PERSON4 had thought in his head that it was the one of the best answers. @PERSON4’s hand shot straight up in the air. One of the first hands raised. “@CAPS1! Lots of answers.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry said. @PERSON1 berry is kind of more of a round person, with some big glasses to see. But all of the students love her as an @CAPS2 teacher, “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 whats your answer?” @CAPS5 I was just scratching my head. Okay @CAPS6.” “@CAPS7 language?” @CAPS8 good answer though”. There were about @NUM2 more hands in the air. In @PERSON4’s head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. “@CAPS9 these last @NUM3 people and then we will go @CAPS5.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry exclaimed. @PERSON4 was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. “@CAPS10”. @PERSON3 said. “@CAPS11 a metaphor?” @CAPS10 answered. “@CAPS13 you’re right it was a metaphor.” “@CAPS14 darn it that was my answer!” @PERSON4 mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer @PERSON4 was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently.	10	12	22
18914	7	A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once apon a time their was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient so the hole world new her as the un patient. @PERSON1 hated that name so she though to let self and she said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I make them @CAPS3 calling me that. So @PERSON1 went around her street and asked everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called the unpatient. NO body would tell her the answer so @PERSON1 sceawed out loud @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called The unpatient.  Then @PERSON1 heard a vocie it was an old man his name was @CAPS4 and he's said I no @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 @CAPS3 being called that way @PERSON1 said @CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then @PERSON1 though to herself I got to be patient. So what @PERSON1 did was she went to the store and you no what she did she got in line and she was patient so when everybody went they said good job @PERSON1 and everybody stopped calling her unpatient.	8	8	16
18923	7	It  was a cold @DATE1 @TIME1 and the @NUM1  and @NUM2 grade football teams were playing at  different  times one at @NUM3 and one at @NUM4 and of course there was @CAPS1 leaders, and I just happened  to be one of them. The game starts at about @NUM3 o’clock and we started cheering. After about @NUM3:15 we were getting very cold we were wareing our warm-ups but we were still cold. So now that we were cold we were  getting kind of cranky. As half time came it was even colder. We all took a brake and went and got some hot chocolate. Well of corse  we were in a hurry to get back to the  bleachers to sit down, well I started to walk faster and faster then I dropped my hot cholate  down the front of me. Well I was mad but I’m a @CAPS1 leader so I have to be happy. Then we started cheering again and it was colder than when we started but we just kept cheering but then some of the @CAPS1 leaders decided they wanted to take off there warm-ups and if more pepole want to take them off well all have  to take them off so we did. And we froze  but we held in there until the @NUM7 game was over. Then we all went home and probubly went to bed.	11	8	19
18924	7	I think patience comes into role in a lot of places. For example you have to be patient to get a job or else the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Another place you would have to be patient to be successful. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, thats not patience. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it. Lastly if you have to wait for it not get it right away, if you money from your job you don’t just go rob the place you have to be patient and you have to wait.	6	4	10
18928	7	When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen.	8	11	19
18929	7	Do you have patience? Well if you she a your like we. But I now in guy that ???  patience his name is @CAPS1.M. @CAPS1.M holols the secret of patience what helps him a lot is he about talk much ??? ??? ?much like one time we were at cedes.

18939	7	Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient, I understanding but I am not that tolerant. Some people though, are tolerant and understanding or patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the @NUM1 grade my math teacher’s assistant had to be so patient with our because they would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and than have to reteach it before to living questions. I was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask questions. I could never be as patient as she was teaching those people.	5	5	10
18940	7	One time I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother @CAPS1 went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened, out of nowhere a car drifts into his lane then @CAPS2. Since our truck didn’t have air bags it was a bad situation. The other driver was in a van with air bags. About @NUM1 minutes later my mom got the call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could to the seen of the crash. I had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to to get @CAPS1. I waited patiently and I was praying he was alright. And thankfully my prayers were answered.  He just got some bumps and bruises. But the car got towed away. We later went to were truck was to get our belongings. And see what happened to the truck the damage on the truck was not nearly bad as what happened to the other drivers van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But I’m glad I still have my brother.	9	9	18
18945	7	“Patience is a virtue.” I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you.	12	12	24
18949	7	When I was patient. It was this @DATE1 we were going to this place in @LOCATION1. It to took us @NUM1 hours to get there but we said forget it we were in @LOCATION1. But we were not in @LOCATION1. It was @NUM2 minight, we were so sleepy we went to holiday inn and wonce we got to the room we went stright to sleep then that morning we went swimming then we lift and went to @LOCATION1 pack. My two cuzins were gotten on my nervs I was about to kill bouth of them they kept fighting and talking about each outher. Then we finally got there at about @NUM3 pm we had to take a little train to get there. The park was huge. The first ride me and my sister and my lil cuzins was the commet. The we got on the, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 runney foleon, and the @CAPS2 and that was a time which I was patient	8	8	16
18954	7	There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were getting @NUM1 pug puppies from a nice lady who lived @NUM2 minutes away. I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs. I guess good things really do come to those who wait!	10	12	22
18957	7	"Sometime it can be hard to be patient, @CAPS1 me it needs to be something I want or want to do. It was a cool day in @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C.I had just turned @NUM1 and was going to meet president @PERSON1 face to face! I won a contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the white house a man took us inside. He led us to a little room then left. It was around @NUM2 then. He said we can't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited played hangman and saws other @CAPS3. Then it was around noon and I was hungry. Around @NUM1:30pm @PERSON1 came in! He said ""would you like something to eat?""I said ""yes""….we went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce. He said sorry @CAPS1 having to wait, but I didn't care it care it was worth it."	8	9	17
18980	7	A time when I am patient. Is when I want something really bad. Like a phone or to get on the computer or something. But that is not  the only way to @CAPS1 patient you have too @CAPS1 patient in church and in the doctors office so there are many way to @CAPS1 patient	4	3	7
18984	7	Patience is like waiting your turn to talk or waiting for something to load, patience can be helpful in many ways such as waiting till you get to your destination or waiting for the person you called to answer the phone so you can talk. Patience can have you expreriences difficulties without complaining.	3	4	7
18999	7	On a morning @DATE1 when every one of my family members wake up at @NUM1 or @NUM2 o’clock am. Me my brother and my sisters told my mom “can @CAPS4 play the @CAPS1 and the labtop.’ @CAPS2 said sure but you guys have to wait until each other’s turn” and @CAPS4 said “ok.” @CAPS3 the @CAPS4 played it. Each person had one and a half hour to play on both things .I let my brother and sister s play first because I’m the oldder one and I have to wait ptiencetly until it was my town. Well until it was my turn @CAPS4 wood have to take playing the game on the things, @CAPS4 wold do that until the day was done. Or until tomoro was done. That wold be it until next @DATE2 or until @CAPS4 can play it again.  And that’s what I say I do as being patience at home and the respect my brother and sisters.	8	7	15
19015	7	I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Some times we have  to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game  and movie releases. but I am  going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasent waiting for the plane to arive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didn’t like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just  to get our food. It was very crouded and it took all patience to not get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how i was feeling oxbout  my patients is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patients  and stay calm.	6	9	15
19017	7	I think that my coach is patient because there are @NUM1 girls she is watching . She has to teach us stuff that we don’t know. Our coach has in teach us stuff like the @CAPS1 play and teach us how to do moves like cross overs. She teaches us to run fast, she has to be patient with the slower kids that cant ran as fast. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them all and it for a little of her time , so she had to be patient.	9	7	16
19023	7	(waiting) (healt beatina ) “@CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS3 is your repolt cords”. said @PERSON2hemlock. I @PERSON1 was the last one in line. “@CAPS3 you go @PERSON1 @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12, keepup the good work!” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS4!!!!” I said screaming happily I ran home going straitght A’@CAPS12” “@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @PERSON1.” @CAPS7 mom aya said . I called @CAPS7 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 saying, “@CAPS9. I @CAPS10 @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12! but can I older something from the internet for @MONEY1?” “@CAPS13 why not for a @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12 tudent. I placed @CAPS7 order and I waited @NUM1 week it…???	9	8	17
19028	7	Patience is a good thing  to have. Good things come from patience and bad things dont happen. But what is patience? Patience is being ablle to handle problems without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others can’t. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so he had  been saving up his extra money for a new @CAPS1. Once he had enough he got a new “@NUM1” flat screen @CAPS1,but if he had waited only about another week he could’ve gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price. Lets say your little sister is bagging you and you beep nicely asking her to stop but she just won’t. So instead of totally flipping out on her which will get u into  tons of trouble just wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you dont	7	7	14
19032	7	The time I was patient I had trouble with football. I needed help doing everything. But my dad helped me. He taught me how to throw kick, run and kaney. I was patient because I watch them I did it. I saw one help my dad playing we went out to join them. The stuff he tate me was hard but it helped.	4	8	12
19036	7	One day me and my brore  asd my dad to tek us to game stop so we cold get a ner game game controller he sad  in a little but so we watid passim by  riding was four about lommits then we went swimmingare pull for a win so  then he still wasn't  redy so we  play with my dog macy and then he was finly  redy to go so we went to game stop to get the control and they didn't har it so we went to @CAPS1 boster and  they had it so we got the controller and they didnt hav it so we went home to @CAPS1 boster and they had it so we got the controller and went home and plad the game on to place  and that is how I was pashint all day. And the best we to be pashint is to keep your self okupid for along  pereld	6	6	12
19046	7	The first time I ever was patient before is when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get @DATE1 film out of my camera my mom always promises me to get the film but sense her money was use on ??? She told me to wait @DATE1 @DATE1. So I waited @DATE1 @DATE1 have crine up and this is what happened I ask my mom again can I get my film out of my camera. She said no because she used her money??? school supples. I was happened to wait another @DATE1 @DATE1 so @DATE1 @DATE1 came again. I ask her and she said no because once again she spend her money no paying people back from them helping her out like any dad. So I had to wait until next @NUM1 @DATE1 so I waited, and waited, and finally @NUM1 @DATE1 has pass and she forgets so she had to get groceries. So @DATE1 I ask her one more time and she said. Yes but she had to pay my dad back on helping her and after that she said after school I??? bringing my film out to buy. So how now told you how??? I have waited to do that also had to get a new diginal camera because it has been droped to many time.	7	8	15
19058	7	I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for a ride. I was becoming impatience just waiting their. But sudden ly I saw the line move. So then I calmed down and waited, when it was our turn to ride. I just reilized it was a hour we been waiting. Under standing in patience means you know why you have to stand their waiting. Because you can’t push or shuvie your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you can’t do or get what ever you wan’t unless you truble. You can’t hit, cut, push, or shuve to the front of the line, you just have to wait.	8	8	16
19078	7	When I went to get my new phone I had to be patient because my grandma likes to work with a spacific person. The man named @CAPS1 who my grandma and me were waiting for finally came to us so we went to the phase I wanted and he talking for long time, but my grandma said if I wasn’t patient I wouldn’t get my new phone that day. We make it up to the counter and he’s showing thing about the phone, I want to get out of there so I could look at it myself. Me and my grandma finally leave and I have my new phone with and I like it. Name one time you were patient and what you were patient for!	8	9	17
19084	7	One time I was patient when my little brother was taking a shower and I had to go to the bathroom. So I waited and of cource he locked the door so I tried to pick it with a toothpick, it didn’t work. Then I told my dad and he said “be a man you can hold it in” so that didn’t work either so I was just about to take the door off the hinges and then he walked right out and smiled at me so then I went in the bathroom and it was soaked in water so I yelled at him and that’s wen I was patient.	7	8	15
19089	7	Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with if you are impatient, and then people will say that you are impatient, and needs to calm down. Being patient also means that you are polite person and that you will not complain about anything, also that whatever happens, you will be understanding and you will wait. Let`s say somebody was in a line to get food. You would have to wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his/her food. That is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for litter children/ kids. You are setting an example and being considerate. These are many reasons on why being patient takes understanding, and being considerate.	7	5	12
19090	7	Me and my brother have been asking for a dog for a while, every month mom and dad said were going to get one every month ve dog @CAPS1 a fish. Mom would look online for dogs and dad would look online for dogs and dad would look trought the paper. Colin and I told them dayliey well feed it walk it give it water the month of my birthday like @NUM1 days befor the @NUM2 they said that we were getting a dog! tommorrow! It was at @NUM1:00 at night so we couldent fall asleep because we were so happy! the @CAPS2 morning around @NUM4 we got in the car mom said the place was in howell so it couldent be that far. Colin and were so happy we got to the house and there were @NUM5 dogs small fluffy dogs one white @NUM6 black I told my mom I wanted to geher @CAPS3 told me it was up to dad dad loved he so that means @CAPS4. We named her vary patient. and our patiens wore of it was well worthit.	7	10	17
19094	7	When I had to go to the doctor. I had thought that I would be in front. It was over @NUM1 people there in line when we got there more people was still coming. I had to get my shots. So we had to wait patiently. But my mom could not wait because it was so many people there in front of use. So I fell asleep. She was still walking around. So wen I woke up five people had already gone by. She still could not be patient, still walking around making me nervous then another @NUM2 went by its going really really slow. Then she finally cooled down. She was so patient because they said they was going to put her out. I have never seen her so patient it was no believable.	9	8	17
19105	7	One time when I was patient, I went hunting with my mom. You have to have a lot of patient to do that. When my mom and I were siting in the deer blind she was getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came. But we were siting there for about @NUM1 hours. I was about to lose my patients but then some deer came in, a mother deer and her fawn. My mom didn’t want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be all alone. So we waited for more deer to come in but none did. But I still had my patience in me. when it started to get cold and dark out we thought no more deer were going to come in so we just went home and plus my mom was starting to lose patient a little bit. But that’s the time I was patient for a little while.	9	8	17
19112	7	Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you don’t have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didn’t want to wait so she didn’t look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldn’t really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So that’s what happens when you don’t have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so that’s my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences.	5	6	11
19151	7	"I was patinent when we were on the bus, we had just arrived at school the kids were loud and nociy in the day. Were a lot to get off the bus when someone jumped in front of ??? then I fell back into my seat, the was about @NUM1 - @DATE1 kids getting off the bus. So I waited for all the kids to pass me then I got up and walked down the  alie to the door, then the bus driver said"" thanks for waiting"". Then I left"	5	7	12
19153	7	I am always patient. But  do you know when and were I am really patient? It is when I am getting my hair cut. Every time I go to get my hair cut it is a lot of people in the @CAPS1 shop. So day people say they have to go some were for a party or for church and need there hair cut pronto. So I let them cut and I have to wait and be patient. It makes me kind of happy to be patient because I am helping others and if I need someone to be very patient with me then I will want them to be patient.	8	6	14
19158	7	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting at the dentist for my brother. My brother name is @CAPS1 and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully I had my @CAPS3 so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later I went to the bathroom. When I got out a nurse told me to come with her, she lead me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor didn’t even start yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days the doctor finally showed up. After a hour or so the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually funny. Finally we left and I didn’t lose my patience.	8	10	18
19160	7	One time when I was patient was when I was in the end of the year in fourth grade and I’d just signed up for football. I had @DATE1 wait from @DATE1. When I got my football pads, I was so excited for football I put them on about four times before football started. @DATE1 passed by and it was @DATE2. In @DATE2 I show cows so that made @DATE2 zip by really fast. Finally it was @DATE1. I only had @DATE1 wait eleven days until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super fast and six p.m. came fast. Then it was time @DATE1 go. I liked football that year and I have did football ever since.It took patience @DATE1 wait for football. Two months @MONTH1 not seem long, but for a ten year old it is hard @DATE1 wait that long.	10	9	19
19163	7	The doctor appointment. Oct @NUM1 @DATE1 me and my mom were getting ready to go to the doctors. Once we got their it was so crowded. I felt like we had been their for weeks days even @CAPS1 their were a lot of kids crying and playing. I was so exhausted I was still waiting for my turn to see the doctor @NUM2 mins later still not my turn I was trying my hard to be patient but it didn’t help at all with all the noise of the kids running around tell ???. I walked up to the regiester and that’s where I found out my appointment I want till @NUM3 oclock and it was only @NUM4.	7	7	14
19169	7	One time I was patient when I went to the dentist. When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got their we got checked in and there was alot of people there so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting I was sitting on the ground being really board. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn’t know. Finally the doctor called my name. So I went in then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor, then when she was done I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was working with a different patient but then he finally came then I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient.	9	10	19
19184	7	I know person that’s way more patient than me! That person is my sister. My sister is the most patient person you’ll ever meet. I am not patient at all.First of all when were going somewhere my sister would just sit there. I would say can we leave now.My sister is always patient! That’s why I think she’s patient.	5	4	9

She and my mom were going to soon and wouldn’@CAPS1 be back till nine p.m so she needed me to come over.

We ran around, talked each others (mainly they tackled me) and I lifted them upside down, then at light thirsty of put them in bed and cover them everytime twice.

We dint have to wait a long time , @CAPS1 my ride we ??? to wait a longtime  to get on @CAPS1 my friend  was very patiente and I was not.

It's the best ride in the whole wide world.	8	6	14
19232	7	One day when I was patient is when I was waiting was waiting @CAPS1 @NUM1 to come out of game stop. One day til  @CAPS1 @NUM1 come out I kept looking at the signs of the game and I said “@CAPS2 must be a good game”.

19244	7	It was my first game. I was pumped ready to go in, coach yelled big guy and I was by his side. Then he said next play you re going in. Ther the assistant said no I wasn’t aloud to. The whole time I didn’t complain. I never said one word to anyone. I helped other people. It was still fun. The whole time at least I didn’t complain and make it worth for everyone else. The whole time I was on the side lines. Never went in not ounce. I was very patient. Not to say I wasn’t mad. At least I got some exercise standing there. The whole time I suported my team mates. I encouraged. I help in any way shape or form. I listend to them complain. But I did give suport. There I was so mad I could have killed. I was ready but my coach said no. It has my time to shine. That one stupid word stood in my way no. But at least I learned something.	10	9	19
19254	7	Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who “claims” to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isn’t up yet.	4	6	10
19271	7	When my @CAPS2 and I got into the checkout line at @CAPS1, @CAPS6 heard impatient groans and signs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued her cheerful whistling, and didn’t seem to notice. “@CAPS2 this is going to take forever!” I whined. “@CAPS3’t be so negative. It’s not that long.” @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. “@CAPS5 about @CAPS6 play a game?” @CAPS6 continued a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store my @CAPS2 said, “@CAPS7, when you’re patient, you get food!” @CAPS6 both laughed and drove home.	12	12	24
19273	7	I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didn’t mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had payed off, and I had a great day.	10	12	22
19274	7	I’m going to write about a time when my sister was being patient to go to the dentist. One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was so happy. Also my mama had to go to other places to. First, we went to costland mall to get me a homecoming dress. After that, we had to go to shoe depot get me some shoe. Third, I went to go get my hair done. Last, we were on our way home but I told my mama my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist, we had to wait @NUM1 min. I told my little sister @CAPS1.M.G this whole day you have been patient. I couldn’t do that.	9	9	18
19293	7	I remember the time when I had to be so patient, it wasn’t even funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to get one when the school year started. I waited and waited until the school year started but my mom told I would have to wait another week because she didn’t have the money from all the school supply shopping she had done. So I waited another week. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents plan a trip to @LOCATION1 that weeket, so I had to wait another week. It was on the following @DATE1 when I was at my cousin’s house and my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone and I was so happy that I finally got it. So I guess you can get cool things when you are patient.	9	8	17
19294	7	One christmas about a year or two ago we drove up to my grandparents house. They live in cold water so it took about @NUM1 hours. All my relatives on my dads side were there. All the presents were under the tree and I couldn`t wait to open. The parents were just talking about nonsense, so I opened my big mouth and said “can we open presents now,” we stated to open the presents but the adults had to go first. They are the slowest gifts openers ever I was about to rip the presents out of their hand`s and open the presents I didn`t do that thought because I was being patient. After they finished I said,”yes” of course thought my little cousins had to open next. Let me tell you they aren`t fast at all either. After that I finally got to open my presents. In the end it was worth it I got an x-box @NUM2, and over @MONEY1. That was the time I was patient.	9	9	18
19301	7	I remember when I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my step-grandmother for @CAPS1 and went fishing. I didn’t really went to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek we were going to fish in was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the ‘backyard’. I flung my fishing lips into the water and waited. After maybe @NUM1 minutes or nothing (except my sister who caught most things.) The finally started to unravel. Excited, I kept out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the real. Twisting and twisting the handle for what seemed like forever, I brought it up. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My step grandmother threw the fish back. After another @NUM1 minutes I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster then ?? I’d caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step grandmother. My patience lead up to me catching the biggest fis of the day and learning something new.	10	12	22
19326	7	There is many ways to be patient like while your wating in the lunch line to pat or when you line up to leav the room. Heres a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was talking to some and I wanted to go right away but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient.	7	8	15
19330	7	I had to be patient when I really wanted a @CAPS1 bike crank and I had to make money for it so I went to @CAPS2 houses picking leaves till I showed them shouveling drive ways. In @CAPS3 time I had the money for my @CAPS1 bike. It was hard to be patient but in the end it payed off.	8	4	12
19342	7	"Clunk! I @CAPS1 in my seat as the rental car crashed into another pothole ""look whose awake so my mom berked as annoying as possible. ""You slept for long was though him might sleep until school that back up. ""@CAPS2 are we"" asked in a dreary voice. ""ohio"" replied my mom's friend @PERSON1. We were going to @LOCATION1 with my mom @PERSON1 and me @CAPS3 @PERSON2 over spring break. We would be staying in the florid @CAPS4. While we were there we would be visiting my dad as he was working in @CAPS4. I was going to be a memorable trip, but I knew the car ride there would be the ultimate test of my patience. It would take us @NUM1 or @NUM2 days to reach our destination. The @NUM3 day would be the hardest of there all. This was the day we would he driving through the mountains. I can usually pass the time when I am riding in the corners, the ?? the @CAPS5 ??. However when we reached the peak of the @NUM3 mountain, everything went hectic. First off, my @CAPS3 (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there were not any guard rails and we were in the lane close to the edges. Second, my @CAPS3 started grasping my arm like her life her depended on it. Last, and worst of all, my bladder started getting up! All of things combined to make our pleasant ride through the mountains, a rollercoaster ride that I will never in a moment ever forget. The whole time I was thinking to myself.""I 'm going to go insane! Just make it stop. As if on cue, the screaming came to a halt, the pressure of my @CAPS3's grasp on my arm was relieved and we were pulling into a rest stop with bathrooms. If I had not been patient during that ride through the mountain I would have gone insane. I would be sitting in all asylum. I will always remember that ride through the mountains."	12	12	24
19358	7	A time I was patient was when I was sitting at my house for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want.	4	4	8
19366	7	Being patient, what does it mean? It means that; “you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn’t complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn’t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn’t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn’t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!	8	9	17
19377	7	One @DATE1 day, my uncle took me to @CAPS1 point to go on a roller @CAPS2, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The line was so long, we waited at least @NUM1 hours. Time went by slowly and we finally got on. After, we went to the @CAPS5 thrill @CAPS6, which took about an hour and a half.	7	7	14
19385	7	One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, I’m very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at @CAPS1 point like on the way there, getting a campsite, and also in lines. But in the end, it’s all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient	8	6	14
19388	7	One time when I was patient my friend @PERSON1 went to the mall around @NUM1 am. @CAPS2 were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes. When @CAPS2 got there the sun was really bright up in the sky, the birds were chirpping, and it was as hot as a @DATE1 day. When @CAPS2 both walked hardly anybody was there but @CAPS2 went to a store called???, it was so full of people  I thought I was at a concert. @CAPS2 had to wait in the longest line, it was so long people were almost at the doors. So @CAPS2 both waited and waited.  Finally @CAPS2 were at the front of the line and the casher said “@CAPS1, you have waited in the long line probably for about @NUM2 hour. I will give you guys a @PERCENT1 discount.” @CAPS2 went shopping and @CAPS2 got rewarded for being patient.	10	8	18
19417	7	"When I was @NUM1 years old, I went to my first doctor's appointment it was extremely nerve naking. I sat in a chair next to my mom, shaping, wondering, non-stop for @NUM2. I was running around and when I finally sat down I said."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! I couldn't be patient anyone. So it walked out the door, when the nerve called your next."" And I was like ,"" well that wasn't long, only about @NUM3 and a ½ , "" @CAPS4 it's only @NUM4 and we got here at @TIME1 "" @CAPS5 that wasn't long,"" my mom said. Next time when I go to the doctor I will be extra patient."	8	9	17
19423	7	My dad is in the @ORGANIZATION1. He goes away for long periods of time. The only time he comes to ritit us is in @DATE1, near my birthday. But one year my dad wasn't able to come home when he was supposed to. He sent us a letter saying that they were keeping all the trooper for an extra six months. I felt depressed for the longest time. But then I thought about it. Even it was delayed, he was still coming back hopefully. So I decided to be patient rather than disappointed. Our family sent him care packager over. Eventually he did came back. That was a hard time, but it was patient and got thought it.	11	11	22
19430	7	One time I had to be patient was on my birthday. One year my grampa and gramhna was late for my birthday. I had to wait a few hours. I sat down intill they got here. When they got here we get to eat cake. After that I open my presents. It took them about @NUM1 hour for them to get here.	6	8	14
19446	7	This is a story about a vampire named @CAPS1 who goes to a regular middle school. It was the first day of school and @CAPS1 was waiting in line for his schedule and later combonaiton. And this line was really long. @CAPS1 was late on his first day and he had to get in the way back of the line. The person in front of him kept complaining and @CAPS1 was getting ??. This will take forever!” complained the person in front. “@CAPS3,shut up,man. I dont like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining? “exclaimed @CAPS1. Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. This was not a good sign. @CAPS1 stopped talking and just waited in line . After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music at  his ipod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the  front of the line. Then something bad happened. “@CAPS3 this isn’t my schedule!” said a blonde girl. The person who was giving  out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule. So @NUM1 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If @CAPS1 hadn’t patience,he wouldn’t have standed the @NUM4 minutes in line! Good thing he brought his ipod @CAPS5!	12	12	24
19454	7	My own way about patient is that when somebody is doing something. You have to wait until they done. An if you rush them they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is a very important thing. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you not being rude.	6	4	10
19478	7	“@CAPS1!”I yaled as the ball came over the net right to me. ” That was @CAPS1!”@CAPS2 said.  “@CAPS3 I was already there.”I responded.  “@CAPS4. @CAPS3 it’s @CAPS1.” @CAPS13 argued.  “@CAPS5 I said @CAPS1, you??? Moved and let me get it then wimp @CAPS6 me. And watch the ball drop. I exclaimed. “@CAPS7 I guess.”@CAPS2 apologized. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. “@CAPS9 is @CAPS10 @CAPS11!” the A team coach demanded. “@CAPS12 partner up in groups of three!”@CAPS13 said??? Mu two best friends som and @PERSON1 were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good. “You want to be partners with me and make? “@CAPS14 asked. “@CAPS15, “I responded. When it was our turn on the @CAPS11 we were going against @CAPS16, @PERSON1 who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, @PERSON1 and @CAPS16 all cheered. “@CAPS18! Very nice job ladies!”??? One of the coaches. It was the end of the second @DATE1 tryouts. There was only one more @DATE1 left. It was hard for me @CAPS3 I managed to keep together and patient. On the @DATE1 of tryouts we got to know our teams. We all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time. Me, @CAPS16, and @PERSON1 plus some other good girls made the A-team! So that’s a time where I had to be really patient and stay together, @CAPS3 I still came through and succeeded.	12	12	24
19481	7	AHH! Oh hi my name is @CAPS1 I’m going to tell you how I waited @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS2 to do something sweet. Ok I heard about this awesome but scary place called the @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Me and a few friends of mine @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 plan to @CAPS7 there in @DATE2. So far me and them have been just doing the ordinary. @CAPS5 up, @CAPS5 in the shower, @CAPS5 dressed, @CAPS7 to school. Today @DATE1, @CAPS8 are going to my parents’ house and @CAPS7 online to see when it opens .@CAPS8 found out in two days the new location will open up. It is near the parlor and down the road of @ORGANIZATION1. So @CAPS8 cheak it out and its nearby so @CAPS8 are so read to be screaming like a baby when it gets its bottle tooken away. Today is the day @CAPS8 are on the road but what @CAPS8 did realize was how many people would be there. When @CAPS8 got there it had at least @NUM3 people waiting! @CAPS8 sat in line and about every @NUM4 minutes the line decreased by @NUM5 people. Then finally about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 of waiting @CAPS8 were in the to @NUM7. It was just own luck too, @NUM1 people were not patient enough to wait but @CAPS8 were respectful. Then @PERSON2 had to @CAPS7 use the rest room so @CAPS8, walk across the  street so he could @CAPS7 then when @CAPS8 came back @CAPS8 ended up in the top @NUM9!@CAPS8 waited another @NUM10 then @CAPS8 were in! By the time @CAPS8 were done @PERSON2 was crying (he is @NUM11!) @PERSON1 wet his pants ( he is @NUM12!) and @NUM13 and I didn’t do anything ,@CAPS8 had one heck of a night but it never would have happened if @CAPS8 were not so patient.	12	12	24
19489	7	I was patient when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctors me and my mom wait patient for a long time. It felt like years but it was alone for @NUM1 hour then when the doctor called us back to the room wait for a long period of time and a nother half-hour we waited.

19518	7	Melay was a little girl, waiting for her parents in the @CAPS1 bush. @CAPS5 didn’t know why @CAPS5 had to. Her parents second distressed all the time now.” @CAPS2 must be something I did,” @CAPS5 thought. Her sister was not as patient as @CAPS5 was waiting. @CAPS5 had to be doing something all the time. So when her parents didn’t come and somebody else did @CAPS5 wasn’t happy. Boys came walking along the road @CAPS6 @CAPS14 were hiding carrying @NUM1’s. Melay was thinking, “these are boys waiting along the street. Are @CAPS14 crazy!” @CAPS3 their parents told them to hide @CAPS2 was always for a good reason. @CAPS5 sat @CAPS13 thinking about this when @CAPS5 heard a loud crack! “@CAPS4 was that’s” @CAPS5 thought. @CAPS5 looked to @CAPS6 her sister was supposed to be and @CAPS5 wasn’t @CAPS13.” @CAPS6 was @CAPS5?”  @CAPS7 @CAPS5 looked out to @CAPS6 the boy soldiers were standing around laughing.” @CAPS4 were @CAPS14 laughing at?” @CAPS5 looked closer and saw that @CAPS2 was her sister. “@CAPS10!” @CAPS5 cried out. “@CAPS6 are my parents, @CAPS14 should be here by now,” @CAPS5 thought. The boy soldiers were walking towards her. Thats when @CAPS5 saw another two married and depleated bodies. @CAPS5 found out that @CAPS2 was her parents. @CAPS5 started running. Running away from tragity. @CAPS5 made @CAPS2 a mile before @CAPS5 had to hide. @CAPS5 hid in a bush. The boy soldiers were walking around looking for her. Suddenly one cried our, “@CAPS13 @CAPS5 is!” @CAPS14 dragged her out of the bush, and walked for @CAPS4 seemed to be forever. Finally @CAPS14 reached a build. Melay was screaming at herself,” @CAPS3 only I waited. @CAPS3 only I waited. @CAPS14 took her into a room and the boss raped her @CAPS14 quickly shot her to death and dragged her into a dumpster. @CAPS3 only @CAPS5 had waited.	11	12	23
19530	7	I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom can decide when I would get my phone. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was acting very patient  so my mom would think it’s time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasent little angel. But she still didn’t say it was the time to get a phone the next @TIME1 @DATE3 I acted the same way but better. I still didn’t get it I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day @DATE1 I cooked my mom some breakfast and I was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone. Nope she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am so I dressed very professional\ casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said “@CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get something” I smiled so  hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and I wondered my ma said “wait @CAPS2” me still wondering   watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @DATE5 the last day for the week. I dint do anything but mop all day.  I was still being patient though. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friends house. @DATE4 my mom was up when I got up for school and she said “@CAPS2 you can have your phone now and I hugged her tight and run out the door very eagerly to try it out.	12	12	24
19553	7	One early @TIME1 in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 for a @ORGANIZATION1 skating competition I completed. I was waiting to hear if I made it to the @DATE1 part of the event. I had completed in. it was seven in the @TIME1 when we left the rink. We went get a bite to eat and went back to the rink when we were finished. My best friend @PERSON1 also was in the same event I competed in. I knew she would make it to the @DATE1, but I didn’t know if I would or not. After a endless wait they were about to call out the people who made it. I kept saying over and over again in my head my number I was given.  They called @PERSON1’s number. I was waiting for my number to still be called, but they never called it. I had not made it. I was disapointed, but I couldn’t do anything about it.	10	9	19
19563	7	A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by or the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table. At the garage sale I had a lemonade sale. Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty god! We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate. We hadto do a whole lot of work but I liked it a lot!	7	8	15
20723	8	" My best friend, @PERSON1 and I have been close ever since we were @NUM1. We met through @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lessons at our local dance studio. We've stayed close throughout the years because we've always done similar activities. We're very different from each other though. I'm more out going, I like to speak my mind and I'm more carefree. @CAPS4's the opposite. @CAPS4's very conservative and @CAPS4 can take things too seriously. But either way, we manage to even each other out. Finals week had just gotten over, and @LOCATION1 and I had been planning a sleepover all week. We just needed time to relax and have some time to ourselves. When I had gotten home from school, I gave her a quick call. ""@CAPS3?"" @CAPS4 answered. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS12 time did @CAPS16 wanna hang out?"" I asked. ""I was thinking @NUM2?"" ""@CAPS6 good!"" I quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and my blanket. I put my shoes on and headed back out the door. My dad dropped me off with all of me gear. I had brought my pajamas, my pillow, and an extra blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked, and waited. Only seconds later did @CAPS4 answer it with a big smile across her face. @CAPS4 lead me down to her basement where @CAPS4 had all the junk food set out ready for us to attack. @CAPS4 had gone to the store earlier that day and had bought everything. @CAPS4 had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used. There were chips, cookies, sodas, candy, chocolate, and pizza. I set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we could eat all the food. We simply weren't big enough. After eating for almost an hour straight, we laid on her basement floor trying to gain composure. We started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen @CAPS7. Eventually, we got to talking about how each of our finals went. ""I did soo good on all of mine! I'm gonna get ALL A's"" @PERSON1 bragged. @CAPS4 has gotten straight A's every year since middle school. ""I think I did pretty @CAPS8 too, not so sure about a @NUM3 though."" I said as I was laying upside down on the floor. ""@CAPS8, we'll just see tomorrow!""  We finally decided to move ourselves over to the couch on the opposite side of the pool table, so we could face the @CAPS7. It was already @NUM4 in the @TIME1 and we were still on a sugar high. We switched back and forth from watching some old scary movie, and the top @NUM5 music videos of the week. That had passed some time and before we knew it, it was @NUM2 in the @TIME1. @PERSON1 and I were laying on opposite ends of each other. Occasionally, one of us would get some chips or candy from the table. We grew tired to the point where we couldn't keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep fast. When I woke-up the next @TIME1, @PERSON1 wasn't laying across from me anymore. @CAPS4 was sitting in the corner chair where I had set my stuff. I looked at the clock, and it was already @NUM4:30 in the afternoon. I looked back and @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 seemed somewhat upset. I shifted around under my blanket so I could face her. ""@CAPS5..."" I grunted, while I was stretching. ""@TIME1."" @CAPS4 said abruptly. @CAPS4 was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand. ""@CAPS12's up?"" I asked, sitting up on the couch. @CAPS4 crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I picked it up from my lap and unfolded it. It was her report card. I scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades. @CAPS4 had received all A's... and one @CAPS13. @CAPS4 had gotten a @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper to see her hands covering her face. I walked over to her kinda amused by how upset @CAPS4 was.  ""@CAPS16 got a @CAPS13... and @CAPS16're crying?"" I asked. @CAPS4 looked up at me quickly. I looked at her with a stupid face, and @CAPS4 busted out laughing. @CAPS4 felt so stupid for crying over @NUM8 @CAPS13. I stared laughing too. I knew my grades we be far worse. Heck, I'd be glad to get @CAPS13's. @PERSON1 and I are the perfect best friends. We even each other out. I tell her to lighten up, and @CAPS4 tells me to focus more. @CAPS16 can't take little things like that too seriously, it's just not worth the stress. Sometimes @CAPS16 just gotta relax, and maintain your focus. @CAPS16 have to find your perfect balance of work, and play."	20	20	40
20725	8	 I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness.	21	20	41
20747	8	" These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody."	18	20	38
20755	8	" ""Laughter is the key to the soul."" @CAPS1 you are having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, laughing can always make it better. I was sitting in @CAPS2 class one day, and was bored out of my mind. Then, a shy, quiet kid, all of a sudden started laughing! @CAPS3 couldn't stop! It was like @CAPS3 was on ""laughing gas."" @CAPS3 laughed so hard @CAPS3 couldn't breathe. Now this made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laugh. Soon enough the entire class was laughing! So even though some of the people in @CAPS2 class might have been bored, or had a bad day, the laughter was spread throughout the room, making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire, and it makes everyone happier. And when you are happier, you are healthier. So with that, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter in it, in order to work. When you ask someone what they like about there boyfriend or girlfriend, if it is a @CAPS2 relationship, they will almost always say, ""@CAPS3/she makes me laugh."" @CAPS5 when you don't have laughter in a relationship, you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh the more you can live a better life and enjoy life more. Have you laughed today?"	15	15	30
20763	8	"                                   @ORGANIZATION1 blew my mind the first time I seen her. She was my other half. Everything we did together was perfect. She made me laugh with everything she said. She was my better half would sum it all up. I still remember when I first seen her in @CAPS1. The nickname of the town was @CAPS1 @CAPS4 hell because of where it was located, in the middle of nowhere. We met when I was on vacation at @CAPS1. My parents had just retired a few months before and were looking for a cozy retirement home away from the big city's and more closer @CAPS4 the good eastern @LOCATION2 mountains that seem @CAPS4 always have snowy tops and beautiful landscapes. We ended up staying there for a week or so in this little trailer that we took with us. That thing was hell on earth, every time we stopped I would have @CAPS4 set everything up even if we weren't going @CAPS4 use it. It was a two hour process and after the hundredth time you can see how I would get bored. looking for a great house @CAPS4 stay in that town was not hard @CAPS4 come by. They were all amazing homemade houses. Never was a contractor paid @CAPS4 build these houses because the men of the town made them by hand. They were incredible two story oak made houses that look like they could take a tornado coming out with only scratches. We ended up finding this one house that was so amazing that I wanted @CAPS4 live there right off the bat, surprisingly my parents wanted it @CAPS4. But the sad thing is is that we had @CAPS4 sell our house first or we wouldn't be able @CAPS4 afford it, so we put that house on the ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and headed back @CAPS4 the trailer.  We had another @NUM1 days or so there and I was officially bored out of my mind. I needed something @CAPS4 do besides stock the fire and make sure the hot dogs did not burn. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town ( the trailer park was located about half a mile out of town). I arrived in town @CAPS4 be very disappointing. It was just as boring riding a bike around town and stopping inside the shop @CAPS4 make small talk just as sitting by the fire in @NUM2 degree weather. In my mind it was just another boring vacation but little did I know it was about @CAPS4 get a lot more fun. I woke up the next day and took my shower and got ready for the day. It seemed like another boring day in hell from what I could tell. @CAPS4 me fun was doing stuff I normally would not do. But back then @CAPS1 and places like that just did not cut it because all I did that @DATE1 was go @CAPS4 places like this and do nothing so it was expected of me @CAPS4 be bored. I rode my bike around a corner and I saw a bunch of guys and girls that looked like they just came from fishing or tubing or something fun, so I rode over @CAPS4 see what was going on. I started talking @CAPS4 a guy named @CAPS8. He told me they just got back from a youth group get together on the snake were they went tubing and cliff jumping. I was in aw. That seemed crazy @CAPS4 me. Cliff jumping? Tubing? It seemed way @CAPS4 crazy for a youth group. But I guess that's just how they do things in @CAPS1. They just don't go have a picnic they go do crazy stuff that I personally have not done any of the things they were talking about because for one i not crazy and for two I have never had the chance. We kept talking and before they all left they invited me @CAPS4 go on there nature hike up on top of this mountain. I was more than happy @CAPS4 oblige seeing as I love hiking.  I woke up in the @TIME1 feeling all hipped up and ready @CAPS4 rock. I had my permission slip signed and I was ready for a good ole hike. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town at five in the @TIME1 and arrived at the youth administrators house just in time for a protein shake for breakfast ( he offered it @CAPS4 me I did not ask). We drove @CAPS4 the mountain and at the base there were around @NUM3 @CAPS4 @NUM4 people all in hiking gear. It surprised me because I was not expecting so many people. That's when I met @LOCATION1. She was gorgeous so I was attracted @CAPS4 her immediately. We began the climb and I began @CAPS4 talk @CAPS4 her. We were like two pees in a pod. I couldn't get enough of her and her of me. Her laugh made me extremely happy. She was my other half. All I can remember is her amazing laugh."	19	20	40
20775	8	" One time when i was spending the night at @ORGANIZATION1's she wanted to sleep oustide in a tent. @CAPS2 was @DATE1 and we always tryed seeing eachother anytime possible because she had to go back to boarding school alot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went ouside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and i was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. @CAPS2 was like two best friends dating two bestfriends, and we were closer then ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the @TIME1 so @CAPS2 was just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point i was just cracking up with laughfter, @ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd her self while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happend, so all of this was going on at around one in the @TIME1 and i was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When i looked over and saw that she had pee'd her self i yelled out ""@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION1!"" @CAPS2 was the most funniest thing, i dont think i have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said ""@CAPS3 should probably go take care of that,"" and then they got off the phone. She was really embarassed after that, i mean i would be too if that happend to me."	15	18	33
20787	8	 I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that alot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in it's own way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.                         So @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3.	20	20	40
20808	8	 Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughing is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my realationship with my sister @LOCATION1, we laugh all day, everyday. And I think thats why we have most fun together. I laugh most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with @PERSON2 and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. I'm just a laughing person. Everybody knows that. I think when I laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. I have this one friend namd @PERSON3, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time me and @PERSON2 were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. Then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. See, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. Who cares. Be you. I love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. In movies and tv shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  One time me and my sister @PERSON2 stole a truck, well.. We asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. It was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. So, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. It's funny to just sit there and reminise. I could tell you a thousand stories. Heres one. One time, me and @PERSON2 were living with our good friend @PERSON1, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! I'll never forget that time. And even when I'm writing this I still laugh about these stories. One time me and my sister @PERSON2 were skating downtown, and I was trying to do this one trick, I think it was a tre' flip? Anyways, I tryed to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory that I have, I laugh when remebered. One time me and @PERSON2 were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. That was really funny. In the video I'm mostly just laughing. 	15	16	31
20831	8	 I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them. After first half we scored @NUM1 goals so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.  	14	15	29
20859	8	" ""@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my purse is."" I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS7. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS8 to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't."	20	23	43
20860	8	                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear.	20	18	36
20870	8	" Laughter is important, we all know that. It makes life easier, happier and even helps you live longer. It's also very important to relationships. When talking about preference in significant others it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, this is why. this story is , however, not about dating. It is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next.  I had known @PERSON1 for a while for a few months at this point, I had met him on the bus. He was pale, skinny, loud, and he always had something funny and offensive to say. He was a shut in. Before I met @PERSON1 I could dish it out but I couldn't take it. I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to befriending him, we were fighting about something so insignificant that I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Although I do remember what he said. He said that I was a ""hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun jokes at other peoples expense but would get up in someones face if they tried one at me."" this made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right but because it made me realise that @PERSON1 was actually a pretty good guy whose only real problem was that he didn't know when to shut up. Throughout the whole time I have known @PERSON1 he has never stopped smiling. He laughs off everything from stepping in dog crap to his fathers drug addiction he can dull the pain of any blow with laughter. @PERSON1 is my constant reminder to never stof laughing."	16	15	31
20883	8	"Being able to laugh, is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share it with is priceless. Family moments like that, are times no one can take away. They will be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and a very depressing place. Laughter is the main connection between family and friends.  My family and I decided that for our @DATE1 break we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION1. Not one of us @CAPS1 how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went.After two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to get across was huge. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up stairs to see where we were at. There it was @LOCATION2.  Once we got off the boat and through the crowed highways of @LOCATION2, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border. I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she @CAPS1 what she was doing, she replied ""kinda"". After hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were suppose to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS1 what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip we drove around laughing and telling my mom, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment.   Being able to laugh, is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull. Being with family and taking a negative situation, and turning it into the best vacation ever with laughter is truly priceless.Everybody needs to laugh in their life,because you only live once so make it worth while."	20	16	36
20888	8	 @CAPS1 is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in. Therefore @CAPS1 makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations. @CAPS1 is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each others company. My story is an example of laughter's connection between people and the strength of the bond @CAPS1 forms. Picture the scene: @CAPS1 was @DATE2 on the north side of @CAPS2. Hood below the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he could not continue further. Patiently standing beside him was his father, a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in @LOCATION1,and @LOCATION2. The boy was tired, he could not put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The @DATE1 sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. @CAPS1 was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting on foot in front of the other. He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often. The boy's father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going with no avail. He tried another tack, he began to tell the boy stories, perhaps in hope that @CAPS1 would take the boy's mind of the excruciating pain.And to the relief of all concerned, @CAPS1 proved effective. What was most interesting about the whole event is @CAPS1 wasn't the content of the stories that helped, @CAPS1 was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference.An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor I found the strength to keep going . @CAPS1 was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and leg which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead lightened considerably. The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left. The dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels were silenced. This was all due to someones thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone. I believe laughter to be the anesthetic of nature,the emotional element that keeps the world sane. @CAPS1 was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had a indomitable work ethic, was a great teacher, and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found hilarity at each others comment's. @CAPS1 forged a strong bond between us, one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day. Whenever I am morose he always manages to find away to bring a smile to my face and I found that I to had the same ability. To my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship,respect,and love. You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter. @CAPS1 is the drug that descends from the heavens. A drug that runs through the bloodstream of society. In the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also began to laugh. Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spread's throughout both of your faces, as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at. That connective force is a result of the power of laughter.	19	25	50
20915	8	" @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever."	18	20	40
20920	8	 In my storie I am going to tell you about a funny time in my life where me, and my brother liked to pull pranks on my aunt.   @CAPS1 first paragraph is about the first prank that we pulled on my aunt. when i was about six and my brother was four and my aunt had just bought a beautiful purple suade couch, she loved @CAPS1 couch, and me and my brother at the time thought that my aunt had loved @CAPS1 couch more then she loved us. So me and my little brother took two jugs of chocolate syrup, and poor them all over my aunts brand new three thousand dollar couch.    The second prank was just myself, and one day i was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. I was getting very frustrated with the game and i threw my controller down, man my aunt ran over and pop me in the back of my head so fast,and she told me to be a good sport and try it again. But i was upset because i just got popped in the back of my head so i was looking for some revenge, when my aunts goes into the bathroom to go put in her make-@CAPS3 for work, I go into the kitchen and get a grape soda, I walk over to my aunts purse crack open the grape soda and poor it all over the inside of my aunts purse.  The last paragraph is about the worst prank that me and my little brother have ever pulled. One morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was sleep, me and my little brother were sitting on the couch watching television and my little brother says that he has to go to the bathroom and knowing us kids we do everything together so me and my brother go @CAPS3 stairs to the bathroom, and we see the biggest box of fifty-four rolls of soft, lushes toilet paper.Me and my little brother love toilet paper rolls for whatever reason, so we open the box and my brother drops one in the toilet, so I put one in the toilet, then he puts another one in the toilet, then i flush it. Little did we know that it would back fire at us and the toilet started to over flow, but i kept flushing. Then i get another roll and start unwrapping it all over the floor, the my brother gets one and @DATE1 we are knees deep in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt walks through the front door, we don't here her because we are having so much fun in toilet paper and water, then she comes @CAPS3 stairs, goes to the bathroom too see me and my brother and a bathroom thrashed, full of toilet paper and water. But the only thing that she says to us is. CLEAN @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! She slams the door then me and my brother look at eachother then start cleaning. Then finally after hours of cleaning the bathroom is back to the way it should be.   @CAPS1 is the conclusion of my storie about the three worst pranks that me and my little brother have pulled on our aunt.   	17	15	32
20922	8	" Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, which alone are two powerful and essential things to life. There was a time not too long ago that I was able to turn a girl's tears to laughter and made her day a little better.It all starts with the craze of today's teenage world, ""@CAPS1"". Which to those who don't know, it is a website where teens spend quite a lot of time on, and people can comunicate through this website. I log in and see that this girl I like is also signed in, so I start talking to her. The normal teenage conversation of, ""@CAPS2, whats up?"" that sort of thing happens, and then she asks if I am able to hang out. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but most guys would go hang out if its a girl they like. I went to meet up with her at the library and as always, she was beautiful, even though I doubt she was trying. As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could thing about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not. To my luck, it actually helped, and she started smiling. After a little while, I had her laughing and having a good time. Since that day, we have been dating, and are really happy, and everyday when I see her I say something random to make her smile."	20	17	37
20929	8	 A couple of months ago i was hanging out with my freind @CAPS1. It was a @DATE1 and i came to her to spend the @TIME1.At first we were extreamly bored so we went on a walk to go find something to do.We found our friend dylan at the skatepark and we stopped to talk to him for a while. After we had hung out there for about two hours we headed back up to her house.When we opened the door her sister started freaking out because we left so she got stucked with there younger brother @PERSON1. @CAPS1 didn't yell back, she didn't want the drama. Her sister got even more mad because jesssika was not showing a reaction to what her sister was doing. By ten minutes she exploded and started throwing herself around and freaking out. Me and @CAPS1 looked at each other and stated laughing really reallyhard because how funny her sister looked. @TIME1 after her mom had calmed the sistuation down, @CAPS1 and I made a @CAPS3 bed on her bedroom floor and when we were falling asleep we bothbursted out in laughter it was the funnest @TIME1 i have had in a long time.

20965	8	                                Outdoor @CAPS1 In sixth grade I went to outdoor @CAPS1 I got up really early and went to @CAPS1 where the bus is taking students to outdoor @CAPS1. First, of all I board on the way to outdoor @CAPS1. Then they told us in which cabin we were suppose to be I had seven cabin members including myself. I brought my electronic device but the teachers told us that we couldn't bring no devices to the trip. The next day we did some activities first we ate lunch before doing any activities. The foods that we ate were pizza, pizza pockets, and hot dogs then the activities that we did were catch some fishes and put them back to the water we were just examine them the other activities that we did was hike the mountains on the way we saw deers they were eating grass I got really tired then when we came back we were getting ready to go home. Finally I would want to help out and I really enjoyed my field trip.	15	13	28
20966	8	"                              The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When im with my family, we all have such a great time together that we laugh all the time at things or memories we say we remember. While we are all gathered around the table whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner we always have something fun to say and laugh about all the time. To begin with, during breakfast @DATE2 @TIME1, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME1, but suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a banana lying on the floor, when her manager went by she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall. It was impossible not to laugh about it becuase it was the manager. Well that @TIME1 was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said ""@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happend, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and coutches trying to get dried off"" I couldn't believe it and I starting laughing so hard that I had to tell my freinds that were next to me and them too starting laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school, but even though it was something good to laugh at I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told eachother about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his freinds were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of tiolet paper stuck to his pants. I immediatley thought he would have gotten embarrased but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying their cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldnt be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE1 third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enojoyed and had fun laughing with eachother telling about funny things that happen to us during our day."	20	20	40
20972	8	"        Falling in love, @CAPS3 @CAPS1 The falling part was easy, I remember the minute I fell in love with you. Everything about you shined, everything about you sparkled. You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, @CAPS4 when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, ""@CAPS2 have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before."" That, @CAPS2 they saw in me was the power of love. @CAPS4 something they did not see was @CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 one of us would do something @CAPS3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from @CAPS1 so hard. that is @CAPS2 I love, I grew to love every part of you. Especially your laugh.  From @CAPS2 i hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to agree. Being able to laugh with someone, @CAPS3 being able to be yourself @CAPS3 not have to hold up this front, its magical. Its something that makes a relationship last. I guess its kinda like glue in sense. My brother @CAPS3 i are the closest you can get to best friends, @CAPS3 guess @CAPS2 we do in our spare time? We laugh. Hes someone that i can be silly @CAPS3 dumb @CAPS3 goofy with @CAPS3 he still laughs, @CAPS3 he still loves me. :) @CAPS4, although he is my brother it still holds the same respect, @CAPS1 is great. It is also a stress reliever. My teacher told me so. My health teacher that is.  "	16	16	32
20998	8	" Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,""@CAPS2 come here."" I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,""@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS2 always remember that."" I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity."	20	16	36
21008	8	 We all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance. But looking back on the same occurrence you just have to laugh at how silly it was. I recall one of these experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this @DATE1. It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area. I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later that day I found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river. In the @TIME1, I remembered some spurs off the main road from when I have driven with my brother in these woods and decided to go explore some of them near my camp. I decided to go check out one across the river that looked like a fun ride. As I was crossing the it my front tire hit some lose rocks causing me to fall into the water! Thankfully I fell away from my motorcycle, if I hadn't it could very well have fallen on me which, out in the woods by myself, would have put me in quite the predicament. After getting my @ORGANIZATION1 up and out of the water I headed back to camp to dry my clothes off, seeing as how I only brought one set with me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up I realized that the sun had been up for some time now so I decided that I had better get going on another ride before the day's out. This time I stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that lead up to the top of the ridge. As I climbed it became increasingly warm then I broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight. The sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun shine. After a while of just sitting I got going again. The road I was on started to taper down into a valley. At the bottom of it, flood waters had washed large quantity's of silt over the road and it was still muddy. As I crossed it my wheels started spinning out and flinging mud at me as a result I ended up very dirty. Once again I headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river. This time I didn't fall a sleep for quite some time and when I did it was a fit full one.upon waking I packed up my meager supply's and headed out to complete my journey. Most of a day got me only half way to my destination so I was forced to stop and rest for the night. Just setting out my tent and getting out some food for dinner and breakfast in the @TIME1 didn't take me very long. Having little to occupy my time I just sat by my fire and pondered my trip and life in general. When I fell asleep I slept soundly until @TIME1. Waking to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing by me was delightful and invigorating. It only took me a few hours to reach where my dad was going to meet me and take me home.This trip helped me think and gater my thoughts. It also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted. Looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set backs. All in all it was a very good time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul.	20	20	40
21013	8	I think that laughter is very important. It is very important to me because let's say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think its funny it's going to hurt that student. I think that instead of laughing at someone that you could be a good kid and ask him if he is ok and help him up. That shows that student that he really has a friend that cares about him alot and doesn't laugh at him and really cares about his best friend. You also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me it's really not about what I get it's the things i do to help out my peer's . I think that we should not laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and reacact to things like laughing at someone else. I also think that if I would have fell and I got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me so thats what I learn respect the students the way that you want to be respected. So I wouldnt like people to make fun of me so why would I like to make fun of someone else if I wouldnt want them to make fun of me thats why you should treat your peers with respect.	10	17	24
21020	8	 The only true story that I can remember that involves laughter was about @NUM1 years ago at the beach. I was with my mom and my sister @LOCATION1. I was running from incoming waves when I decided to run into just one wave which that wave sweep me off my feet and spun me around for what seemed like forever, but wasn't even @NUM2 seconds. I laughed so hard that I tripped and i started spinning again, my mom had to get me up because I could not stop. I got so many cuts from the sand that it was hilarious. after I got changed I got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it. That's the only time I remember laughter being my true friend.	18	15	33
21025	8	"                                  Friendship and Laughter go @CAPS1 in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 best friend and I would spend hours sitting on her bed laughing at nothing. We could tell stories to each other that, to other people would just be stupid, but to us were hilarious. We would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that was all before the big fight. We have had fights before but none like this. I knew that the decision I would make would ruin our friendship, and take away all of our laughter, but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done. So i said goodbye. @CAPS3 best friends name is @CAPS4, we have known each other sense we were two and have been inseparable sense then. We love to hang out and be together. That was until the fight were I was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and I. I remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do that to me. But I didn't care enough to ask her about it, so I ended the friendship. It hurt but I had talked myself into believing that it was all true. But something didn't feel right, something told me that it wasn't her. But I didn't want to hear it. I ignored the feeling and just went on with life. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in @CAPS3 life. School was a whole other story, it's really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and a couple classes together. It was like I had to keep reminding myself ""your not friends anymore, you don't have to talk to her"", like subconsciously i didn't want to end the friendship. I missed talking to her, so one day I said hello, after that we talked nonstop, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. Except there was one thing missing, the laughter. Sense then we have become closer, we hadn't talked about the fight, but it got to the point to where we could occasionally laugh or giggle at something one of us had said, but never the kind of the laughs that we used to share. I never thought that we would have been able to speak, nevertheless be friends again.  After a few weeks we both sighed up for a youth camp. During that camp I found out the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and came to the agreement that the whole fight had been both of our faults. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and her's because she didn't try hard enough to show me the truth. During that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together. The tension between us broke and fell of our shoulders like a very heavy pack that we both had been carrying. We both apologized for our parts in everything and then went to dinner, and laughed throughout the meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it's a very important piece of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love. Sam and I are still working things out between us but we are on our way to being closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never have a dull moment, we have both decided to work very hard at not having another fight between us. We have both realized that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and laughter inside of the friendship. I love @CAPS3 best friend very much and I love the laughter that we share together just as much, and I don't want to lose that again. So everyday I'm going to make sure that we laugh as much as possible and I'm never going to take our friendship for granted again."	18	22	40
21026	8	"               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought""@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.""I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,""@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there. "	17	15	32
21034	8	                The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the of day of @DATE1, I was turning @NUM1 years old and me and my best friend were at home, I called him seeing what he has planed for this nice sunny day and he told me he had nothing in mind, so we kept trying to think of something but for @NUM2 hours we had no luck. I called him again and we met up at a grade school and just sat down @CAPS3 a bench and started calling people to see whats up with everyone and no one would answer there phones. It became about @NUM3 pm when we stopped calling people to make planes, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat, I told him sure since we had no luck for a whole @DATE2 @TIME1. What sucks was that it was the @DATE2 of the @DATE3, and school was going to begin @CAPS3 @DATE4. So while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see whats up and whats happening.  We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty good, till we started hearing music bumping from a distance, so we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he told me he's going to go pick up lights for a @ORGANIZATION1 and I asked him who's all there and he told me that I need to see for my self. So we walked around the corner of the street we were @CAPS3 and saw the @ORGANIZATION1, we walked up to the door and saw are other friend who was standing at the door, we asked him where is everyone, we been bored all day with nothing to do @CAPS3 my own @CAPS1 and he told me that were here now and that's all that matters, so we walked in and saw everyone we called @DATE5 and more and they screamed @CAPS5 @CAPS1 to me and I was shocked why this @ORGANIZATION1 is for me and how did I get to my own @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 accident. I finally found out that it was planed for me the whole time, I guess that the flier by the restaraunt was put there @CAPS3 purpose and my friend was @CAPS3 this little @CAPS2 to get me to the @ORGANIZATION1 and it was all planed from the beginning of the day for people not to answer my calls or my friends but to get me to go buy some food and to find the flier and get me to go to my own @ORGANIZATION1 and I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get food to find my own @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 flier and we all had a good laugh, The @CAPS8!	20	18	36
21054	8	"Laughter is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS6 frustrating when you can't manage to get someone to laugh? Is @CAPS6 really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile? There's something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes @CAPS6 just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what @CAPS6 is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay. Last @DATE1, I was babysitting, @CAPS6 was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION1. At the time I could not legally drive anybody outside of my family, so we decided to call my sister, @LOCATION1. She had the day off work, so @CAPS6 seemed to be a perfect day for frostys. We waited for what seemed like forever for @PERSON2 to get to the house and finally, after about an hour, she pulled in the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded into the back of @CAPS4 car and off we went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there, we started getting out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON2 had just locked the keys in the car, with the keys still in the ignition and the car running! I was still getting the kids out of the car so you'd think that I would just reach in and grab them, but no, that was not the case here. I asked @PERSON2 ""@CAPS3 did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to get your keys?"" @CAPS4 response was, ""@CAPS5, no! I locked @CAPS6 too! Don't close your door!"" @CAPS6 was too late. I instinctively closed the door after i was done. I hadn't really thought about the fact that I could have saved all of this from happening, especially considering that I was the one that noticed @CAPS6 first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after I ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't figure out what was so funny. Then @CAPS6 hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION2's parking lot with three kids, locked outside of a car that was running and we didn't really know what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and have @CAPS4 bring the spare @CAPS1, but we weren't really sure where the spare @CAPS1 was at the time. My mom said that she didn't have @CAPS6 so we would have to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS6 was. We called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid, but then said the @CAPS1 was in his truck and somebody would have to come get @CAPS6 from him because he was about to go into a meeting. Obviously we couldn't go get @CAPS6 from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS6, though at this point she wasn't very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us to not worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @CAPS6 with @CAPS6 locked, and just go inside @PERSON1's and get our frostys. Through all of this @PERSON2 and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy role playing me closing the door while @PERSON2 said not to. They thought @CAPS6 was hilarious. @PERSON2 and I were not so humored by @CAPS6, although we did think @CAPS6 was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again. Instead of us making the kids laugh, they were making us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION2's for almost two hours before my mom showed up with the @CAPS1. @CAPS6 turned out that the @CAPS1 was not in my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS6 was at our house, hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys. That didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mom showed up with us not there. The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day, neither was @PERSON2 blaming me for everything and making me fill @CAPS4 tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting. The funny part was the kids. Still today, they laugh about our little @PERSON1's adventure. @CAPS6 just makes me realize that @CAPS6's all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone. I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day, even if they think @CAPS6's the worst day ever. Laughter really is the @CAPS1."	20	23	43
21064	8	"@PERSON1 of laughter     Once upon a time there once lived a girl named @PERSON1. The year was two thousand and fourty eight and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE1, thats @CAPS7 the world ended. @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was a huge @CAPS1 freak. She would, by herself, make funny vidoes and put them on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. One day she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an I'm a @ORGANIZATION1"" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON1 had ever seen. She was wearing a a @ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS1 shirt with some of the known characters. @PERSON2 was singing, ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you."" @CAPS7 she was finished she posted it on the web site. @PERSON1 showed all her friends what an epic faliure that video was, @PERSON2 of course loved it and so did @PERSON1.      Once the video wasnt that cool or funny anymore, which that took about two point five days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But @CAPS7 someone would watch it for the first time they would go to school, laugh their butts off and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didnt think it was funny anymore. So from then on people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION1. Eeveryone in @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group all laughed and @CAPS7 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didnt laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing @CAPS7 someone is being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves and it's not a laughing matter.       @CAPS7 people watch the video of @PERSON2 saying she was a @ORGANIZATION1, that was made to make people laugh and to think was funny, @CAPS8 didn't make the rude words people say to be used to put others down.      Laughing is a key thing to a conversation but also it's healthy for people to laugh. @CAPS7 others see that people are getting made fun of, it's not a time to laugh at them, it @MONTH1 be funny in some case but, put yourself in that persons shoes, feel what they are feeling @CAPS7 people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop the people who are throwing out put downs and stand for the ones who are getting their feelings hurt. Laughing was made for things that are actually funny. Say you walk down the street, on a sidewalk, and you walk by these punk kids who think they are the bown diggity, and they are poking sticks and throwing bottles and trash on at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is on the ground in pain from thses kids kicking him to where he cant move, are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No @CAPS2 not, @CAPS2 going to walk, or run, over to the poor man and see if he is oaky, then you maight call the police and see if they can find the kids who did this to this poor old man. See laughing at people who are down because of words or getting beat up isn't right and peeple need to stop, this is a world that if you are the last few people on the planet, and they have known about you laughing at others pain, do you really think that they are going to help you, or just walk by and laugh like you have? People are cruel in this world and we all need someone that is going to help us if we are hurt or down because of hurtful words.      One way you benefit from laughter, you feel good and you have people that will help you in the time of need, if you laugh about the right things. Tell @CAPS2 friends that if they laugh at peoples pain and anger, that one of these days no one is going to be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we have in schools, in work envirnment, in life in genral, be the change for @CAPS2 kids and grandkids, for @CAPS2 future friends, for the future world."""	20	18	38
21074	8	" Somewhere along the road a guy once said ""a laugh a day keeps the doctor away."" @CAPS1 the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until i found out first hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was. It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me.Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do u recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if u can then u might understand how I felt...and sometimes do feel. If not you @MONTH1 learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single. Before that certain event,when @CAPS2 and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing weeping, just obnoxious sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic. Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred @CAPS2 and i were together for years, two and a half to be specific. yeah, long time I know. The day it ended it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? the middle of freaking class!) @CAPS4 convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything to unusual to me. I was thinking ""yeah! i get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!"" I was such a idiot. I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. @CAPS4 was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t-shirt. @CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off dirty blond hair, rose petal lips and believe me on this one unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my @PERSON1 t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I'm not exactly sure @CAPS1 it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like a oncoming thunder storm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. ""We have to break up"" my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't...my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm. I quietly and quickly walked out of the room making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways along with the tiles and eventually grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with no wear in mind. Until when i was finally to tired to stop. My cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended. As i look back at @CAPS2 and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was however not enough. No amount of trying to laugh it off would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes though look back on how I reacted and that by itself will make me laugh. I was no better than those people in those movies. Unlike them however, I did not weep and bawl obnoxiously."	20	17	37
21075	8	" Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about."	20	15	35
21079	8	 Have you ever been in an an awkward situation and lightened the mood with laughter? I have, as have many. I find that laughter makes people more comfortable, which allows them to be their own person. Laughter @MONTH1 even help some to attract a positive, friendly crowd, who enjoy funny, happy people. Laughter @MONTH1 not work in this way for everyone, but here are some ways it has helped me. I was at a homeschoolers' group in @LOCATION1 years ago and didn't know anyone there. After walking around a while this girl talked to me. She was funny, and being able to laugh made me more comfortable and I had a fun time. I just had to fin d the right person. Another time where laughter might've helped was when I was invited to a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in over two years. Several others were there I hadn't seen in a long while. The whole visit was awkward and all I wanted to do was blend in. I acted like everyone else, but if I'd had laughed and been more comfortable I would've been my own person. When I first came to public school I was nervous to meet new people, and what kind of people there would be. After a week or so people got to see my personality, the funny, happy, laughable person inside, and that clicked with a lot of people. That's why I'm friends with the people I'm friends with now, because our alike personalities matched. Laughter brought me to a good place in life. Laughter can make a lot of people happy and comfortable in awkward situations. It can encourage people to show their own personality and attract people like themselves. I think the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh.	19	15	34
21086	8	"               The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3 started out a few years back when I first met my cousin @ORGANIZATION1. For the first time I spent the night at his house, the day before we were outside all day running around his yard and jumping off their roof. @CAPS3 was all very fun and entertaining but no matter what we did @ORGANIZATION1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. ""this looks like that!"", or ""she sounds like this!"" @CAPS4 his tone of voice and his unique way of shouting @CAPS3, I could not stop laughing. @CAPS3 was unbearable, @CAPS3 made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach would begin to hurt and @ORGANIZATION1 himself would begin laughing from watching me slowly collapse from the uncontrollable laughter.@CAPS3 did not stop there, later that evening we stayed up almost the entire night watching @CAPS1 videos on @CAPS6 and playing @CAPS7 on the @NUM1. The laughter got even greater as we were both becoming extremely tired and our minds were racing all over our thoughts, we laughed until the point where I fell over laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of my cousins imparable mouth made me burst out laughing as if I was hearing the funniest joke for the first time ever.The next morning I had an immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. even then, @ORGANIZATION1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a @CAPS1 subject. The next morning we had breakfast and @CAPS3 was just as fun as the night before. Listening to the nonstop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject and every thought possible. The day continued @CAPS4 the ever-lasting laughter between my cousin and I. Later as I left I though to my self how much more fun I'll have the next time I come to visit. From then on @ORGANIZATION1 and I became best of friends and the times got better and funner. Without laughter, life would be incomplete."	15	15	30
21101	8	                                                   THE @CAPS1  A couple of weekends ago me and my cusin were at my grandmas house. She lives up in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cusin did was ride,have airsoft gun wars, and build giant forts. We planned on only staying one night but ended up staying three.   So the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods. The fort seemed really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort. He got done before me so he went down there first. By the time I got half way down there I heard him scream and come running out of the fort. He was yelling @CAPS2 .....MICCCCEEEEE! So i figued we must have a little @CAPS2 problem and laughed to myself. So I walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little @CAPS2 running around in there. That was the end of forts on the ground for us.  The next day we decided to have airsoft wars(guns that shoot little plastic bb's). We were having alot of fun shooting eachother mainly because it hurt. Like I said we were having alot of fun until I decided to try and hid up in a little tree. He found me and shot me I fell out of the tree and broke my gun. That was the end of the wars plus I almost broke my leg. I guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing.  After the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while. There are alot of trails around her house to ride on. He road a dirtbike and I rode a quad, I road a quad so I could make new trails. We made some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were way out in the woods on a long ride I ran out of gas. So I had to walk all the way back to the house for gas then walk all the was back up there.  The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a tree fort so we didnt have to worry about critters. We spent from the time we got up till the time we went home on this awsome tree for. My granndpa has alot of wood that he dosn't use because he really to old to build anything so we never ran out of wood.                          	20	20	40
21126	8	"When my friend @PERSON2 and I went to go hang out with our friends from @LOCATION1. We knew how would get there but we didn't know how we were going to get back, but knowing us we didn't care we just wanted to have fun. we had lot's of fun hanging out but then it started getting dark we needed a ride back home. Later on I decited to call my dad to see if he would come and get us. Knowing my dad he thought it was really funny that my friend and I were stuck in @LOCATION1, so he started laughing. After he was still laughing I asked so can you come get us cause its getting ready dark and he said no, cause it's not his fault that I was stuck there. So @PERSON2 said ""why don't I call my dad to see if he would"" and so she did but just like my dad he also started laughing and said no. Later on @PERSON2 and I ran out of people who to call. So we said to each other why don't we worry about his later it's really not that dark and we can all still hang out for a while longer. After i thought that throw I knew we should start worry about because later on it well get even more darker then it already is and then we diffidently wont have a ride home. So I told @PERSON2 that we should keep on trying people while we hang out with our friends more, but she didn't care so much. I made a call to my sister @PERSON1 to see if she would do me the favor of picking us up from @LOCATION1. I called and call her but she wouldn't pick up her phone. An hour past and we still couldn't think of someone, but then I thought to my self maybe my other sister @CAPS1 she always does favors for me, I called her and I asked her if she could and she said yes ill be there in @NUM1 minuets to pick you guys up. So I went to go tell @PERSON2 the great news that I got us a ride home and we don't have to worry about it anymore. When I went back to the park she wasn't there any more I thought she went to the bathroom, so I went to checked the bathroom for her but she was not there also. I thought to my self where could she of gone. I started to get really worried about were she went so I walked around and looked for her. So I looked at my clock and saw that my sister was going to be here in ten minuet, before I realized she was at the store getting food and she didn't tell me. I got really mad at her for not telling me where she went, but I thought to myself it didn't matter so why was I going to make a big deal about it and then I heard someone beep and it was my sister @CAPS1 I got really happy to see her cause all I thought of is going home and sleeping all night and all day. We got in the car and my sister asked why didn't I call my dad for a ride? I told her I did but he didn't want to pick me up because if I could get here then why couldn't get back home. She started laughing at me and thought it was the most funniest thing my dad has ever done. After we dropped of my friend @PERSON2, we went out to eat to burger king and got two salads to go. When I got home my dad asked who brought me and I told him my sister went and got me and took me out to eat. After being stuck in @LOCATION1 so long and not having a way to get I just went to my room and went to bed because it was a very long day for me and my pore little feet. The next morning I didn't wake up until @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My dad thought i need to wake up already so he went it my room and woke me up and told me i need to eat and get fresh air. I woke up and took a shower and eat some food and took a very short walk because my feet were still hurting from yesterday. when I went on my walk I was thinking about how I shouldn't of just gone to @LOCATION1 with out making sure I had a ride back home, but I was very thankful for my sister going out of her way to pick me up and not get mad or even yelled at me. when I got back home I called my sister and told her that I was really thankful for her going to go get me and my friend and even taking me out to eat."	12	15	27

21144	8	 Close people to you enjoy the moment you have shared with them and remembering it back brings laughter for what had occurred in that moment. Laughter brings people you have known from a long time together because you have had a feeling for that person and for the moment. Laughing at the memories that were spent with that person and enjoying it can make you closer to that person and it can be important to that relationship. In fact, it has happened to me before; laughter came to me when i saw a special video from my past. It was when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party. My cousin was very chubby and with straight hair, but that day she was very sick from fever. I was very different because i had curly hair and was short. We both had a dress on, but the dresses had different styles. Then everyone at the party was having fun and we were, too. The video got to the part when my cousin and i were bouncing up and down grabbing our dress and making a show for everyone at the party. In that time we were suppose to be dancing. It seemed we were having to much fun that day. Afterward, my youngest brother came close to where we were dancing to see us dance, but he was caring with him a cup of soda. Then one of the grown ups gets up from its chair and bumps into him and he drops his cup of soda which splashed my cousin and me. All of our dress were wet, dirty ,and sticky from the soda. We both stopped dancing and sat down on the ground and started to cry. My aunt and my mom changed us to something else, but later when we saw my brother we were so mad that we didn't answer him when he asked us something or wanted to talk to us for that fact. Later on, we were having fun again and talked to him back again. Finally, the video stopped. It's important that laughter gets people closer to someone because together they're having a great moment while laughing. My cousin and i watching the video remembering our memories made us laugh from what happened to both of us. We have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age. We noticed how much we had changed right now from all the funny times we had enjoyed together. We did realize that it was not my brothers fault for splashing us with soda. Laughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united. Obviously, in different time in life you react in a different way, but laughing in that moment or later on gets people together. Sometimes in time feelings are different, but laughing is important because you're sharing the moment of happiness with someone. I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments.  	20	20	40
21171	8	 In the @DATE1 on the month of @DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.End.	20	15	35
21179	8	 When i think of a day where laughter was the element, i think of @DATE1. That was one of the worst days of my life. I had plans to break up with my girlfriend.  That morning, my decision was final, and i was going to do it. For some reason when i woke up, i felt sick. That day, everything was falling apart. Around @NUM1 @CAPS1, i went to my girlfriends house, and broke up with her. The next day, i couldn't smile to save my life. The whole day my friends were making me smile, and showing me they cared. The next day i felt so much better. I was smiling and laughing like nothing ever happened. All day my friends were telling me jokes, and being really stupid. They made me laugh so much.  Throughout those upcoming weeks, i met another girl. I couldn't be anymore positive about my life. All i do now is just smile and laugh. I don't need to live my life with sadness. All i can do is just be positive, and smile. Laughter is very important. No one should go a day without it. Just lets just lives our lives to the fullest, and put the past behind us. Just think on the bright side, and smile.	15	16	31
21192	8	      Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed?That @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not have happened to me. In my story I'm going to talk about the funniest time I have ever had with my best friend @CAPS1.       How it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house. She invite only me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @CAPS1's grandma owned a @CAPS2 @CAPS3. She was old and was in a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kinda of club. So anyways in her her club what the did was go on trips. @CAPS1 and I thought that would be fun to go on a trip. So we meant everyone at @ORGANIZATION1.         @CAPS1's grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip. I wanted @CAPS4. The bottle was really cool. It had a top like a water bottle would have. I got the red kind cause it the best. We got are drinks and @CAPS1's grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip.      So here is the funny part of the story. I got into the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap it pulled open to paper back on the sell. I twisted the cap back on and took a drink. Mean while @CAPS1 got into the car and closed the door behind her cause her grandma was talking to the adults. While she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come help her. I had my drink between my legs and the cap was open and remember its like a water bottle cap. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight into the front seat. It didn't get and were else just into her grandma seat. It was like a rocket it was so funny. @CAPS1 with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat. I told her it was my juice. Then was both started laughing.         I don't know why but @CAPS1 just pulled on her head and her head was no longer stuck. The was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we have to tell her grandma about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me cause her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling her. She told us to go get napkins from the bathroom. The whole time we were going to the bath room me and @CAPS1 were just laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't get in trouble.         I guess that I have never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day me and my best friend @CAPS1 always laugh at that story. I am so glad we went on an old people @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club trip.                       	15	20	35
21204	8	" It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1 so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out @CAPS4 surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around @NUM1 people at each one, but it wasn'@CAPS5 the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS4 attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS1-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in @CAPS4 school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least @NUM2 highschoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON1 (who later has become one of @CAPS4 best friends.) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking ""I'm gonna get back into that game!"". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS4 recon of the tables, @CAPS4 deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge it's master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS4 silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of @CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS4 butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON1 then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what @CAPS4 high school life would be like if they didn'@CAPS5 attend @CAPS4 new school."	16	15	31
21208	8	" The first day I met her, I knew @CAPS4 was the right dog for me. Her black and white fur was as soft as cotton, and her eyes as brown as the bark on a tree. @CAPS4 had a genuine personality no other dog could possess. Which was something I could tell right away @CAPS4 was the dog for me. Over the next couple of months, our friendship grew, as I taught her to talk, smile, and stand on two legs and dance with me. A black lab @PERSON1, instantly became her best friend, as the two ran over the property barking and playing. Everynight the two would cuddle up next to eachother and sleep. The times @CAPS1 (my new dog) would lay on her side and relax, I would call her an oreo. Her middle belly was white and her sides were black, making her look like a large-breathing oreo @CAPS1. @CAPS5 her name had come from. The seventh month had came along fast, but it was enjoyable every day with my @CAPS1 at my side.@CAPS4 gave me the best comfort when I needed it, always giving me a smile when the day was rainy, or sleeping next to me when I didnt feel the best. It was kind of like @CAPS4 was my own special dose of medicine, her presence made me feel well again. Her love had grown deep into all of our hearts at that house and @CAPS4 was one of a kind, but something began to change about her as the days went on. Her food bowl would be nearly full everytime we fed her, @CAPS4 wouldnt run with @PERSON1 anymore, @CAPS4 wouldnt talk, and @CAPS4 wouldnt smile. I knew something was wrong. We didnt know @CAPS4 was sick until it was too late. The first day @CAPS4 had thrown up blood. That was when the worrying began between my boyfriend, his mother, and I. We wanted to find a vet to help her, but none of us had the money to do it. The second day in the @TIME1, I couldnt find @CAPS1 anywhere on the property. I thought that maybe @CAPS4 had just gone for a walk around the outskirts of the house, until it reached @NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her. Panick spread throughout my body and I gave up looking for her and turned towards @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1,"" I looked at her straight into her eyes, ""I know you can hear me."" @CAPS4 looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. ""@CAPS5 is @CAPS1, @PERSON1?"" I knew @CAPS4 understood me as @CAPS4 began to sniff around the areas of the property and suddenly as if @CAPS4 had picked up a trace, had followed a line of scent to an old opal car. @PERSON1 wagged her tail looked at me and looked back under the car. There @CAPS1 was sick looking. So I pulled her back up onto the property for my boyfriends mother to look at her. We werent sure if it was poisoning or something else. So we called a animal expert and asked. @CAPS4 said it sounded most likely like parvo, since we hadnt gotten @CAPS1 her parvo shot yet. So over the night to help her feel better, I and my boyfriend stayed up shooting water into her dehydrated body, and spinach juice hoping it would help, but all @CAPS4 wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided we would check up on her in the @TIME1. In the @TIME1 my boyfriend had to go to work and I was left alone with @CAPS1 to take care of her. I sang songs to her as @CAPS4 layed on the porch sad looking and in despair, I stroked her on her head telling her how much @CAPS4 was my best friend and my favorite dog that meant so much to me, and I told her I loved her. I tried getting her to eat but @CAPS4 would only puke it back up. Finally after a day of crying next to her I noticed @CAPS4 kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. It gave me the insentive to check her butt. As I pulled up her tail, i noticed a large bloody hole @CAPS5 flies were flying out of. @CAPS4 was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not, and I, my boyfriend, and his father just looked at her watching her be in pain. It was time. As soon as we got to the vet office, they took her inside and layed her on a table @CAPS5 I was told to hold onto her as they shot an overdose of anasthesia into her. it was only seconds before @CAPS4 was gone and everyone in the room was silent and I cried over her limp no longer smiling body.  We dug a hole and buried her under the tree @CAPS4 played under. ""@CAPS1 my mama bear. @NUM2 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 you in heaven."""	23	18	38
21218	8	" Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do @CAPS6. Then she glanced at me. Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. @CAPS5 girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know i saw her smile, and it was at me! There was @PERSON1, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then @DATE1 came. The ice rink in @LOCATION1 was about @NUM1 minutes away, which seemed short because of the @NUM2 friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice.Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about @CAPS1 of @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and the various other games that held our interest.  But as usual that conversation turned into a debate about ""over powered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a @DATE2's breeze. Then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before.  She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""@CAPS5 the sniper is @CAPS6 @LOCATION2, you don't know what you're talking about!""my friends sneered at one another. I had @CAPS5 interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards @PERSON2. As i approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her.  I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along."	22	20	42
21225	8	" Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared."	25	25	50
21241	8	"  Laughter is important  The last two weeks of school, and I was told the best news ever. My mom had told me that I would be flying to @LOCATION1, by myself. I was excited because I haven't seen my family in awhile. Even though @CAPS1 been on a plane a couple of times, I was still scared, I have never flew by myself, so this was going to be something extremely new. Even though I was excited and scared at the same time, I just kept thinking about seeing everyone in my family, and even meeting family members that I have never seen or heard from before. School seemed to be going by very slow, and I was very anxious. When two weeks passed I already had my bags packed and was ready to go. My mom was trying not to cry, but she did anyways. I walked threw the metal detectors then down a long hall way, finally I had got on the plane. On the plane ride I was thinking about meeting my real dad, and that's all I was thinking about the whole time I was on the plane. I landed in @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 pm that day. I was glad too because I was tired. My sister picked me up from the airport. Me and my sister didn't have a close relationship, so it was kind of awkward. She started talking about times when we were younger, and how we had fun. Since I was in @LOCATION1 I wanted to see a lot of my family members, most of my family members already knew that I was in town, news travels fast. When my aunt's seen me they were in shock, they said that I had grew so much. I was so happy because it was one of the best moments ever. I met so many people, especially family friends, it was a amazing because I even met some of my moms school friends. Days after, I had got a text message from one of my sisters that I have never seen or met before, and she was so happy to know that I was in town. She told me that she and my dad wanted to see me, and spend some time together, so we made plans. I was really nervous, because the only time that I have seen my dad was when I was really young. That was fifteen years ago. I really didn't know what I was going to do or say when I was finally going to meet them, I was very scared, so I decided to take my sister and my cousin just so it wouldn't be awkward. We decided to meet at my grandmas house. I haven't seen her in awhile, and unfortunately she wasn't there. When my dad got there, I didn't know what to do, I didn't recognize him, or even my other sister. We gave each other hugs. When we got into the house we were all quiet, and all my dad could say was ""@CAPS2"" because I grew so much. He then started talking about the silly little things I did when I was a little girl, and it made us all laugh. All we did was laugh, and it made me cry a little. If it wasn't for laughing my relationship with my dad couldn't have been better. "	15	15	30
21251	8	" Laughter has many benefits; happiness, joy, bonding with others,adreneline, the helping of releasing tension, and the joking that is made on a daily basis around you. Laughter is something that can be shared among people especially when they're in the dumps. This emotion is the one that will brighten up anyday and bring enjoyment. Laughter has been a huge part of my life. From family, friends, boyfriends, and stangers laughing has always been a big deal to me. I love being able to look at someone and see that they smile alot, which means that they probaly laugh alot and that they are a happy person. How can I tell this. Well for starters there is dimples in their cheeks and crows feet in the corner of their eyes. Really the crows feet don't matter about how old you are they can happen from laughing, smiling all the time, and squinting in the sun. The biggest part of laughter that has contributed to my life is having a relationship. Usually when you have laughter in the relationship it will make it last longer. The reason the relationships will last longer is because you can be yourself and let the other person see that you are fine with laughing and being part of their life. I believe that laughing in an relationship is the best part. Lets say your partner is in the dumps, are you just going to let them be moody all day or are you going to try to make them laugh and cheer them up. When I'm in a relationship and my partner is being moody I try my hardest to cheer them up. I love to make people laugh. And when I'm being a grouch my boyfriend is helpful and tries to make me feel better or they just comfort me to see what is wrong. So if there is not laughter in your relationship then obviously there will be no happiness. Therefore it will not work out between you and the person you're with. So spread the joyfullness of life and and make people happy. Another part that laughter that has been in my life is friends. If you don't know me well let me tell you I'm shy at first, but once I warm up to you, you'll see that I'm a very outgoing person. Like most of my friends will say is that I am weird, but I enjoy laughing alot and making others laugh too. When I'm around my friends and in the dumps someone will always in the end will get me to laugh. No matter how upset I am they can always get me to laugh at pretty much anything, since I am a really easy person to entertain. Being around these people is like watching a comedy movie or act. They are always finding some way to be funny and annoying. Such as being obnoxious and doing stupid things that others will never do because it's embarassing. Well just because it is embarassing doesn't mean you shouldn't at least do it. If you don't do it, it will give us more to do and give us all the attention to ourselves. How are you suppose to know whether or not it's funny if you don't want to try something new. How are you suppose to laugh at yourself and have others laugh with and at you no matter how stupid it is. So don't knock it until you try it. The person that once said, "" laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is it true or false? Is this really the shortest distance or the longest? I honestly believe that is could be the a short distance. You don't want to be snooty or crabby all the time or you will never make friends or have any relationships. And if you don't have friends or any relationships then who will make you laugh and enjoy yourself. If you're not a happy person then how are you to experience the joys of life and everything around you. You won't, so put a smile on you face and be a spontaneous person who is not afraid. Laughter is a benefit to all man kind. And laughter in my life has showed me so much, it has brought me and others so much experience to enjoy. Those enjoyments that have been explored, are having boyfriends, friends, and family around me all the time. This is one emotion that is definitely one that will brighten up anyday and bring happy expressions to every ones faces. Share the laughter."	20	20	40
21269	8	"  Middle school was a challenging environment. Not only are kids subjected to a rapid advancement in the academic environment, but a maturing social environment as well. The rapidly growing need for social dominance and in turn inflating egos makes for a bully breeding ground. Without the skill to be able to laugh it off, I would fear for anyone's mental well being in that environment.  Throughout my first @NUM1 years in middle school, I struggled with the building social discomfort of classmates higher in the social chain, making for a severe toll @CAPS1 not only my self-esteem, but my academics as well. The stress of my own social stature plummeted my grades continuing a cycle resulting in even more stress. The whole situation seemed hopeless and depressing. I could not believe that in only a little over a decade of life, my outlook had become so grim. I wondered how I would make it through the rest my school years.  Everyday I had the pleasure of hearing any number of new insults made up by those higher in the social ladder, attempting to supplement their growing self-esteem and inflating egos; @CAPS1 some days even those who I previously believed to be my friends joined in with them. Except for a few trusted companions, it seemed the whole world was out to further themselves by bashing me with any number of new insults.  Being made fun of daily had continued until I realized something; That laughter is key in social survival. Without laughter there was no way I could have survived those school years. After this revelation I was able to laugh at things said to me and laugh at myself as well. I was able to take the the cacophony and learn with it, taking it as critique to better myself. Through laughter and their jarring remarks I was able to secure my position in the social scheme as well as improve my intelligence, as well as make new, better friends and come to peace with others, while maintaining the the hurt I experienced earlier to be ""popular"" without having to make fun out of those who were like who I used to be; @CAPS2 a win-win scenario.  Laughter is key in any situation, whether it be a conversation with a friend, or experiencing the penned up frustrations of immature adolescents. From laughter I learned a great lesson, one that I hope everyone has not learned should. Without the lesson of laughter, I don't know how anyone could lead a successful and pleasurable life.

21276	8	" ""@PERSON1, @CAPS1 up! It's almost time you to go to school!""  @CAPS2 mom yelled at fuzzy hair, half-opened eyes, and yawing boy. That's me. Today is a first day of @CAPS2 first new middle school. Our family moved to a new place, that's why I had to move a school too. I woke up and took a shower and wore @CAPS2 school uniforms with exciting and nervous mind, because I didn't know anyone from @CAPS6 new school. When I arrived to the school, students who are same age as me started to scream out loud for sadness of school days that are coming up or excitement of meeting their friends again. On the other hand, I was depressed and confused because of these hyper students and the new school. I shook @CAPS2 head off and started to concentrate finding @CAPS2 classroom. '@CAPS3 hah! There it is.' @CAPS4, I found @CAPS2 classroom and when I stepped in, @CAPS5 looked at me curiously for a while, since I was the ""new"" kid to @CAPS6 school. I sat alone and waited for teacher to come. During I was waiting, I put @CAPS2 head down and slept a little bit with no smile on @CAPS2 face. Suddenly, teacher opened the door and spoke loudly, ""@CAPS5 sit down and be quiet!"" @CAPS6 teacher must be the most strict teacher I've never seen. While teacher was writing down something on the whiteboard, the students were trash-talking about the first sight of the teacher. It was terrible for yelling at the student when you saw for the first time. For example, I knew a kid who went to a private school and transferred to a public school. I had a same class with him and I was his partner. Since I didn't know him very well, I started to ask questions about him. At first, he answered back nicely to me and I thought, 'We could be close friends from @CAPS6 class.' @CAPS7 it was wrong. He started to talk loud to me when teacher was explaining something to us and it got me into trouble for talking with him. Other students hated him for being distracted during class and he often asked useless questions to the teacher really loudly. Also, he had weirdest perfume smell that he thought it was cool to wear. @CAPS5 thought he was annoying which caused to a small fight. @CAPS8 arguing with other friends, he stopped coming school and now we don't even know where he is at. Like @CAPS6, it shows that the first sight is really important to have in relationships with other people. When I heard that the first sight is really important from other students who were sitting behind me, it changed @CAPS2 mind to an open mind such as having a smile on @CAPS2 face. I though, ' I shouldn't be like that kind of teacher's first sight. Maybe I should change @CAPS2 face looking with smiling and some confidence on it.' @CAPS8 that class, I started to put smile on @CAPS2 face and thought positively. I tried to be participate for the class and worked hard for making new friends in the new school. Therefore, the other student opened their mind as well and started to ask things about me. For example, it was like these questions; 'why did you come to @CAPS6 school?', 'what sports do you like most?', 'what game do you play?', and etc. From those aggressive questions, laughter can change @CAPS2 looking and make good relationships. How did I know? When I first entered to @CAPS2 classroom with concerning face on it, @CAPS5 just stared at me and looked like they didn't want to know about me. @CAPS8 putting laughter on @CAPS2 face, they started to feel comfortable than the first time. Changing me depressed face was @CAPS2 starting point in the new school. I started to make a lot of friends which it became a way for me to be a class leader. I felt really amazing and awesome that how ""the new guy"" can be the leader of @CAPS6 class. I felt proud of myself and thought of happiness that I actually started to have laughter on @CAPS2 face since the teacher didn't look good without a laughter."	17	17	34
21281	8	"                                        Laughter: The @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 Laughter, they say, is the best medicine. We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while.  @CAPS3 younger brother, @PERSON1, and I, we have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS3 way to say hi to @CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS3 own brother. @PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together. One night, at the dinner table, @CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that @PERSON1 never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION1's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON1 blurted out, ""yeah, @LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."" @CAPS3 parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON1, it was!! It was @CAPS3 turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS3 parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, ""I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."" I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS3 vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS3 laughter. @CAPS3 parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS3 mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS3 mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS3 hand over @CAPS3 mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS3 grip was so hard that it made @CAPS3 teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS3 whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine!

21284	8	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @ORGANIZATION1 is the shortest distance between two people. They express happiness, belonging and they let you forget your worries for a few seconds. Who does not like to laugh? I will be writing a true story in which laughter will be one important part. My story will be about myself, who is an exchange student and @CAPS1 in high school, and how I got to know my today's best friend.It all started in the morning of my first day in a @CAPS1 high school. I remember clearly how nervous and excited I was. I was not able to focus on my breakfast because my mind was full of thoughts and questions. How is the school going to look like? And what are the students going to think about me? I have never been in the @LOCATION1 before and I have never been an exchange student. Because of all the worries, which were running through my mind, I did not even notice that it was already time to leave the house. This moment which I have been envision for month, finally arrived. My host-mom said good-bye to me and wished me a great day. Now I was totally by myself. I walked in the high school and went to my first class: @CAPS3. On the way to the classroom, people stared at me, but nobody said a word. Have you ever felt like you are alone even though hundreds of people are around you? This is exactly the way I felt in that moment. My first class went well, as well as my second class: @CAPS4. During @CAPS4, some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. Although this question seemed really stupid to me, I answered nicely with yes. My next period was drama. I had trouble finding the drama room, but luckily I met a girl on the way who showed me where I was supposed to go.Her name was @PERSON1 and she told me that she moved here last year from @LOCATION3. From the first moment I saw her, she seemed really nice to me. On the way to the classroom, she asked me questions about the difference of @LOCATION2 and the @LOCATION1. She also appeared quite interested to me. While our drama teacher was preparing a scene, we continued talking. I had the strange feeling that I have known her forever. The whole nervousness I had at the beginning of the day was gone. I told her that some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. She answered that they asked her the exact same question, but about @LOCATION3. Suddenly, she started to laugh. It was a happy and friendly laugh and soon I started to laugh as well. It did not feel awkward for me, sitting next to a girl I just met and we were laughing so hard. I knew that this moment, this laughter was special. I felt so happy and belonged and it let me forget all the fear and doubt for a few seconds. What I did not know in this moment, though, was that she will become my best friend. This was my true story, in which laughter was an important part. It is not easy to be @CAPS1 in school, especially if you are an exchange student. My story showed that a laughter is able to change people's thoughts and to short the distance between two people. In my case, it made me feel more comfortable and confident, which was the start of a great relationship, as well as an awesome time in the @LOCATION1. The end	20	19	38
21322	8	 Folded In @DATE1 it was right around @DATE2, two of my friends and I were out riding quads laughing and having a great old time. They were teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad. Soon after they started teaching me i figured out that what I had to do was hit all of my weight on the back end of the quad and f lore the gas so I could pop the front end up and I was just doing it fairly well from there on out. Well, when we were about ready to to go back up to the house one of my friends thought it would be super cool if we got a picture of one of us up on the front of the quad while the person driving pops a wheelie. To do this one of us sat on the front of the quad, one of us sat on the back of the quad and, one of us was driving. first thing we do when were all situated in the quad is that the driver pulls back a f lore's the quad (the driver doesn't need to slam down on the back of the quad because there is the extra weight from the person on the back)Which in turn pops the front end up. Then the person on the back jumps off and snaps a picture on their phone and then the person driving is supposed to brake and set the quad down. Lucky me I was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie. While he was popping the wheelie either he pulled back to far and hard or he flored it for too long. So I was sitting on the front and it stayed up in the air for about five seconds and then the scary thing happened. The quad started leaning back so my friend jumped off and tried to hold it so I had some time to jump off but, I panicked and froze to the bar i was holding on to. Then the whole quad came down on me because my friend couldn't hold me up any longer. It slammed me into the ground, all @NUM1 lbs. of it, it caused my shins to hit me in the face( I have a hard time bending my head to my knees let alone my shins)and it super hyper-extended my back so much that I was lucky I didn't break it. When it hit me into the ground it felt like my legs sprung the quad off of myself but, it was really just my friend pushing it off. After the pushed the quad off of me I was laying there for like @NUM2 minutes laughing in pain for some reason that I can't remember.  After I was done screaming, yelling, and laughing in pain I got up and they drove me back up to the house. When we got back up there they handed me an ice pack and told me to go sit on the couch, I couldn't bend my back so I could sit down so I had to turn my back to the couch and basically fall onto the couch. While I was sitting there my back started to hurt excruciatingly bad so i thought if I lay flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as bad and just like I thought it did. So I slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way I could get comfortable. The next day I woke up in really bad pain, it took me like two minutes to get off the floor it hurt so bad. shortly after I woke up I called my parents and had them come and pick me up from the house, I just barely got into the truck and my dad and I drove back to my house and i told my parents the whole story and my mom freaked out and thought I hurt myself extremely bad so she took me to the doctors office and he looked me over and told me I would just have to wait for my back to heal it's self and then i went home.    	18	18	36
21342	8	" My alarm went on at @TIME1. It was another normal @DATE1 for all of my friends, but a big day for me. It was time to get up, eat breakfast, brush my teeth, put the last couple things in my suitcase, and head to the airport. For the @CAPS1 time I was going to fly on a plane across the ocean, and it was the last day with my family in @LOCATION3 for a whole year. The next time I'll wake up will be in a totally different place, country, and family, where I have never been before. It will be a new start for me and my life won't be the same anymore. I will be an exchange student on a high school in the @LOCATION1. After changing planes @NUM1 times and @NUM2 hours of traveling, I was finally at the airport in @LOCATION2, where my host parents were waiting for me with a big sign which said my name on it. I was very happy and excited that I finally arrived, but primarily I was really tired. We took off and headed ""home"". My new home was a little green house on a small ranch in the high desert of @LOCATION4, @NUM3 minutes out of town, and without public transportations. Due to the hot temperatures and the dry air I was very tired the @CAPS1 weeks. Adjusting myself took me about a month. Before school started, I visited my new high school and met the school principle. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had their @CAPS1 meeting the following @DATE2. It was good to see kids that will be on my school and in my classes.  Finally my @CAPS1 day of high school was coming up. It was exciting for me, but I couldn't hide that I was very nervous. After a one hour drive to the school I got off the school bus and walked into the building. It felt like thousands of people were in the hallway looking at me. I walked faster. I was hoping my @CAPS1 day would start out good. Finally, I reached my locker, and pulled out the little peace of paper with my locker combination on it out and tried to open it. Even though, I did it @NUM1 times my locker won't open.  ""@CAPS1 spin it @NUM1 times right, go to the @CAPS1 number, go left, pass the second number once..."", I was whispering to myself. The bell already rang, and thankfully a friend that I knew from soccer stopped by and asked me if I needed help. We both started laughing and I was so glad she helped me out or I would have been late to class on my @CAPS1 day. For the next couple times I needed her help again, until I figured out how to open my locker three days later.  Being open-minded, being friendly and smile are three things that are very important in life. Besides that another very important one for me is also to laugh about mistakes I make. More than anything else, coming to a new culture, land and meeting new people gave me a lot of experience for my life. Especially learning how to laugh about mistakes or situations to not get frustrated. Getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from mistakes I made and to move on. My mom once told me to be courageous to make mistakes, and I don't regret any mistake I made."	20	20	40
21350	8	"  Laughter is the only expression in my opinion to always be positive. My dad claims laughter is the reason for his six pack, it works your muscles. @CAPS3 is very important in a relationship. If @CAPS5 don't have any kind of sense of humor, consider yours self inhumane. When it comes to my family, I am always @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is always positive and happiness follows is in life. If I have a problem I think of something that would make me laugh, a laugh is always nice..  Relationships can be created by having things in common, see my dad and I don't always get along. When we laugh everything else is silent, it sets the mood. If @CAPS5 didn't laugh around my dad he would ask ""@CAPS1 @CAPS5 got a sore sense of humor?"" @CAPS2 again if your not @CAPS3 with me at something funny, @CAPS5 must be an outsider. @CAPS3 is positive and positive energy is good. I laugh a lot, I laugh out loud. @CAPS5 would not have the relations @CAPS5 have @DATE1 if it wasn't for @CAPS3. Some people say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I agree with that statement. If it wasn't for laughter I think that I would be very negative, I would be disciplined more and to think I would be more distant with my dad. As I grow older I see me maturing, I laugh a lot less... My dad also see's the change, we have grown further apart witch is normal with every teenager growing up. My dad is very funny, and even know I'm glad to be growing up I wouldn't trade the world for the humorous relations I have with my dad. Laughter is all around, I see people walking down the street @CAPS3 on their cell phone. I hear of the phrase ""@CAPS3 all the way to the bank,"" I would be @CAPS3 if I was rich too. Being rich is a positive thing, but if @CAPS5 are not @CAPS3 and happy in life then money doesn't mean a thing. I could be poor and @CAPS3, and still be happy. If @CAPS5 are not happy in life then everything @CAPS5 have or worked for means nothing. Laughter brings people togethe,r @CAPS2 is no doubt. I've met many people by just simply ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS5 will be surprised what @CAPS5 can get by just putting a smile on your face, or if @CAPS5 find something funny, ""@CAPS6."" I have a very humorous dad, I would not change it. I believe everything happens for a reason, and I believe that everyone deserves a good laugh and to be happy. I think they deserve it, it's unfortunate not everyone is happy in life, so why don't @CAPS5 personally go out of your way and make someone laugh? @CAPS5 don't know their situation, it is nearly possible a laugh can take @CAPS5 many places. @CAPS5 never know what a laugh will bring @CAPS5 until @CAPS5 find out? Laughter is a strong element in relations, and can base a personality profile of someone and who they are."	18	18	36
21364	8	"                                           ""Laughter"" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too."	20	25	45
21382	8	" Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH1 never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS6 it up"" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away."	22	20	42
21403	8	"                                Laughter @CAPS1 us @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was the @DATE1 of middle school and the entire music department was going on our @DATE1 field trip. Everyone was going to @LOCATION2 for the biggest concert any one has ever been to. Only the students in eighth grade in either band, choir, jazz band, or jazz choir were able to go; if @CAPS16 didn't pay all your funds, then @CAPS16 were left behind. We were going to a hotel, attending a concert, and going to a @CAPS4 @CAPS5.   My friends, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 were without a doubt excited. We have never been on the longest road trip till then. @CAPS3 seemed to have taken days to get to @LOCATION2. We left at five in the morning with over one hundred kids packed into two buses. One bus was for the boys and one for the girls, yet there were more girls then boys so we split the boys bus.   I was stuck sitting with @CAPS6. @CAPS6 is a nice girl, but @CAPS3 was difficult to start conversations with her. @CAPS17 wanted to be back home in @LOCATION1. I never found out why @CAPS17 was so upset; which made my ride there unbelievably boring. Until @PERSON3's accident. @CAPS17 snorted a pretzel up her nose. Overall @CAPS17 was okay and everyone besides @CAPS6 laughed along with her.   By the third hour of sitting in a cramped bus, us girls had to go to the bathroom. Complaining to the bus driver @CAPS17 replied, ""We're almost to the pit stop. Just another hour or so."" The choir girls began singing about going to the bathroom. Soon the bus was filled with our melodious song and laughter. Finally @CAPS8, the bus driver, pulled over. A line of dancing girls bulged out of the bathroom laughing at each other.   Once we were done we said our farewells to the boys as they piled onto the bus and took off. ""@CAPS9 down. Lets get to @LOCATION2."" @CAPS8 said. We cheered as we drove off. Four hours later, we were stopped yet again, at another gas station eating our lunch. The boys were fine with how much progress we made; starting calling everyone of us girls the boys were getting annoying. Us girls ignored all calls from boys for the rest of our trip. Finally we got to our hotel.  At the hotel the boys got the top story while the girls got the lower story near the swimming pool. When dinner came along @PERSON1, our music director, aloud everyone to roam around the stores near by and buy our dinners. Luckily we were near @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and a numerous amount of fast food places. @PERSON4 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 while @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 got our drinks; since we didn't want @ORGANIZATION1 drinks they went to @ORGANIZATION3 to buy @CAPS11. We met back at our room with our goods. We gorged ourselves till our abdomens seemed to explode. Dancing her way into the bathroom, @PERSON3 apeard with a broom as her dancing partner. Our laughter filled the room. We partied on till we realized we had a concert to attend.   We had two hours till the concert and thirty dollars was missing. @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I searched our room almost missing breakfast and ending up empty handed. When we found the girls across the hall all except one of them were there. The remaining girls looked at each other. "" @CAPS6 was out of money yesterday and now all of the sudden @CAPS17 has money to buy food. We're missing fifty dollars."" @CAPS13 replied. @PERSON1 then came in, ""@CAPS14 up. We got a concert to attend."" @CAPS15 at each other with disapointment we all left.  Running to the back stage door I dropped my music. @PERSON2 laughed picking @CAPS3 up. ""@CAPS16'll do great."" @CAPS17 said smiling. I smiled back, ""@CAPS18 @CAPS16."" I turned and stepped out onto the empty stage and took my seat in the front of the band. Picking up my flute I began my solo. The soft chords filled my ears as I imagined myself alone. Although I was nervous my stage fright gracefully vanished.   I ran out the auditorium doors. Girls and boys laughing with me as we raced to the buses. The bus drivers hurried their way to the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Once we were there, @PERSON1 payed for everyone and we were off. Laughing at ourselves @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I screamed at the top of our lungs when the @CAPS19 shock dropped. When the ride was over, we all laughed seeming to have come @CAPS2.  I didn't want to leave, but I knew I had to. Everyone piled back on the bus and called our parents to let them know we were coming home. Laughing at every mistake we made, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I took a group picture to remember the trip. Some how amongst the trip we laughed together at everything. Nothing stood in our way when we laughed. In the end laughing @CAPS1 us @CAPS2. "	20	21	41
21416	8	Many people believe that laughter is a key part of any relationship. There are many times when even the slightest laugh is needed to break the tension, or even just relieve some stress every once in a while. It is often said that laughter is the best medicine, and also the cheapest. Laughter is easily found and common to come by. In my case, laughter comes naturally to my sister and I and for no particular reason at all; it not only saved, but it built our relationship to what it is today.   When we were younger, my older sister and I did not get along very well at all. She would always tease me, then laugh about it; and I too would laugh at things that she did not find humorous in any way, shape, or form. This constantly caused conflict and many arguments between the two of us; therefore we hated each other and, in a sense, wanted nothing to do with each other.  As my sister and I grew older and wiser, we started to become much more alike. We still made fun of, teased, antagonized, and pulled childish pranks on each other; but instead of getting angry, we would just laugh about it instead. As we continued to make each other laugh, we found ourselves getting along so much better. Soon after that, we began hanging out more and more and just for the fun of it, not because our parents told us too. Before we knew it, my sister and I were best friends.  It is rare to hear about siblings being best friends. I am lucky to be able to say that my older sister is my best friend. Personally, I feel that laughter has played a huge roll in the relationship between my older sister and I. Now we depend on each other because we both know that no matter what, we can always make one another laugh and virtually cheer each other up. We hang out when we need to get away or when we have something that we need to get off our chests. We know we have each other for that because we know we can always laugh about it in the end.	20	19	40
21427	8	" Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When your angry, sad, nervous or even mourning. Laughing about the good times @CAPS1 had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in someway or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought. Which made me look on the positive and light-hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, some times hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There was three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what, it was so many years ago. But then on boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes were all eight or nine years old but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says ""@CAPS1 are not in shape, your fat"". This crushed me how was I suppose to reply to this. I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear repeating in my head those evil words that stung me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I could not hold back the tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out if this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter then to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed ""@CAPS2 what's the matter, what happened?"" @CAPS3 tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boys name. I told her @PERSON1. She began to laugh and say ""That chubby kid with the buck teeth?, oh honey don't let that bother @CAPS1 he isn't in shape at all"". I started to laugh realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, which the statement were not even true and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what @PERSON1 said to me. Of course even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless commend about any of this flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation, also. "	17	18	35
21432	8	" Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with @ORGANIZATION1. One @DATE1 @TIME1, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME2, @PERSON1's blue @ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw @PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. @PERSON1 was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored @PERSON1 after a lively conversation about football ensued. @PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, @PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath @PERSON1. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually @PERSON1 and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON1. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion."	27	20	50
21440	8	" Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist."	15	19	34
21448	8	 A time when laughter was one element or part was when my brother showed a youtube video to my family. The video was about a guy who was talking about his childhood when his dad told him to go to the store to get bread to make sandwiches for dinner and was told to not to get into any trouble. To avoid getting into trouble his dad told him to go across the street because there was three boys down the block that looked like trouble. So he did what his dad told him to do and he went across the street but when he was passing the boys they stopped him. One of the boys yelled out something and a bunch of their friends came flying from a that was barbershop across the street and surrounded him. He managed to get free and ran as fast as he could. He said that he was running so fast that he knew that he passed a @ORGANIZATION1 because he said he was behind it and then was in front of the car running to get to his house. When he got to his house he told his dad that he did what he told. The dad was only worried about is if he got the bread and the guy was upset that his dad was worried about bread instead of him. The way the guy told his childhood memory was funny and even though I was already shown the video by brother the night before we both still thought it was funny and so did my family and we would burst out laughing at times.	15	15	30
21465	8	" Laugh @CAPS1 @CAPS2                         @CAPS3 @CAPS4 someone who laughs a lot or a little? If @CAPS4 @CAPS3 the kind of person that can laugh about any and everything, then I'm sure we would get along well. Laughter plays a key part in my life. @CAPS1 is a part in about three different ways, in that I joke around a lot about numerous things, I do funny things such as make funny faces, and last I also laugh about me being a klutz. When @CAPS4 see me or talk to me for either a short amount of time or an abundant amount of time I guarantee I can and will make @CAPS4 laugh. Laughter can be an amazing thing, when in any kind of situation as in an awkward one, an embarrassing time, or just any kind of situation when @CAPS4 don't know what @CAPS4 should do; just remember @CAPS4 can laugh in those times. Ever since I was just a young girl no matter where or what I was doing I always seemed to be a huge klutz. My mom would always say, "" @CAPS4 @CAPS3 worse then a bull in a @LOCATION1 shop."" @CAPS5 was so right. If @CAPS1 was just as simple as me dropping things, maybe even breaking glass, or falling; that statement was always true. All @CAPS5 could ever do when I did do something like that was just laugh, because @CAPS5 knew that @CAPS5 has a clumsy daughter.  Such as this one time when I was in elementary school, we had award assemblies every month, these were to recognize students who had been doing well that month and was following the rules of a certain characteristic. This was the day I had hoped for; my name to get called. When the teachers were up on the stage calling names, I was anticipating for @CAPS1 to be my turn. Then next up my name was called. I got up and was so excited and nervous to go in front of the crowd and get my award. When I had gotten up there I got my award then went back down the stairs. Not a great idea when I was so excited. When I was going down, I literally went down the stairs. My feet had missed a stair, and I went flying down on my behind. Now tell me what would @CAPS4 do in this situation? In front of over two-hundred kids and about thirty parents? Well I just had to laugh @CAPS1 @CAPS2, get up, and go back to my seat. Another thing about laughter @CAPS1 really makes me who I am to this day. I don't know where or what I would be doing if @CAPS1 weren't for me lacking dexterity when I was younger. Laughter has brought me closer to my family and friends. They know when I am looking gloomy; that if they want me to not look so gloomy that they will have to make me laugh. My closest friends and I joke around and laugh about numerous things. Sometimes @CAPS1 might be facetious, so we have to catch ourselves on those ones. From my experience of being clumsy no matter the situation, I learned that instead of being embarrassed and not wanting to bring up what happened ever again, that making @CAPS1 funny, and something @CAPS4 can laugh about is much better. Learning from a young age to laugh and have fun, @CAPS1 really has made me a better person; in that people know me me for many different things, but one of them is that I am a happy and funny girl and laugh a lot.That is something that I am proud of, just knowing that I can make my peers and other adults laugh and have good time. So therefore laughter is not just one element or part in my life, @CAPS1 plays a huge part."	18	18	36
21500	8	" Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS14 always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS11 together we @CAPS11 constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS11 you doing today?"" @ORGANIZATION1 asked. ""@CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied ""@CAPS3 i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?"" @ORGANIZATION1 said in an upset tone. ""@CAPS4. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS14 looked that @CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS3 that day was the day. @CAPS5 dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""@CAPS1 is going on in here?"" @CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. ""@CAPS8 dad."" We said still laughing. ""@CAPS9 then."" @CAPS7 replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION1 fell off of her bed. ""@CAPS11 you @CAPS9!"" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS13 you knew @ORGANIZATION1 you would know that once @CAPS14 gets going @CAPS14 thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS14 lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION1 and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION1 screamed, ""@CAPS12 on my finger!"" @CAPS13 you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS2 be disgusted but when @CAPS14 screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS14 picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS14 started to paint my nails. ""@ORGANIZATION1 it looks like i have @CAPS12 on my finger!"" I said in a loud voice. ""I think it looks very nice."" @CAPS14 replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS11 lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life."	17	20	37
21508	8	" Laughter is necessary to survive in this crazy and beautiful world. It is something we possess with us throughout our lifetime. As humans, we grow old and eventually die, but laughter never does. It lives on forever. Laughter is often referred to as 'the best medicine', and why shouldn't it be? It brings joy to the sad, relief to the burdened, and life to the depressed. The best part about laughing is that it is completely and unchangeably free! Never will someone have to pay to gain a drop of laughter. On the other hand, laughter is also contagious. A single smile, throw back of a head, and a gut busting laugh can cause an entire room to become ill to this glorified epidemic. Laughter is the best release. When I was younger I had a neighbor named @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentering shop. He never talked to the rest of us on our street nor did we attempt to strike up a conversation with him. Day in and day out I would notice his little red pick-up leave in the morning and return at night. His life seemed like more of a routine and I was curious to find out why. @PERSON1 had a wife who, as well, became a vampire to the rest of us. This was completely fine, because to us, she was a monster. Countless times soccer balls would be kicked into her yard by pure accident and she would come out of her quiet house yelling and waving her hands in our direction. She even left a note on my family's front door telling them to ""take better care of your lawn"". I sympathized with @PERSON1 for having to live with the woman. Something in her voice seemed off, as if she was deaf. That aspect of her life always made me feel a little bad for her. Being different could have been a possible explanation to why she treated people the way that she did.  I will never forget the day the ambulance pulled up in front of their perfectly serene house. I sat on my front porch silently watching the medics go inside the house. Not long after, I heard the little red pick-up coming up the road. I knew, as far as everyone else on @ORGANIZATION1, that this was not part of the routine. After about @NUM1 minutes, a body was carried out on a stretcher. My heart sank. Even though I was young, I knew the significance of a hovering white sheet over a being. @PERSON1 was very secluded after his wife passed away. Nobody could blame him for that. He lost the love of his life; he lost his routine. My family discussed and decided to bring him meals. The food was never anything particularly fancy, just something that would keep him going. I've never seen anyone so appreciative. Still, we knew to stay off of his lawn. His wife loved it and he must have felt like she was still attached to it somehow. He was lonely and my family wanted to be there for him. Soon after we brought over meals, my younger sister and I started walking his small, white, fluffy dog and invited him over for dinner as often as our mom would let us. He became more like a grandfather than a neighbor. One day, my friends and I were outside playing soccer on our small street. It was sunny and warm outside. Life was good. I could feel the vivacity of youth pulsing through my veins as I ran around. As of on its own, the ball rolled into @ORGANIZATION2's yard. We all hesitated when we saw his door open. He looked pestered and quite upset as he slowly bent down to pick up our ball. I winced, knowing I'd hear about this later from my parents. Then the unexpected happened, @PERSON1 started laughing. The kind of laugh where a person might be considered crazy for being that happy. The kind of laugh where tears run down a person's face. Not knowing what to do, my friends and I started giggling to ourselves. @PERSON1 threw us the ball and went back inside. His laugh was a clear signal, @ORGANIZATION2's grieving and unhappy soul had been relieved.  From then on, laughter has meant a great deal to me. Laughing can direct you straight to a person's soul. It can be the connection between people. Without laughter, life can seem dull. Once it is brought into your life, it has the powers to heal and restart. That is exactly what it did for @ORGANIZATION2. Through laughter, he got his life back."	25	20	45
21512	8	@PERSON1                                The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 out with buddies are some of the best @CAPS2 of my life if its an adventure or just a @CAPS1 time @CAPS3 out. I wen stergion fishing for the first time in my life with my buddy @PERSON2, i haven't known him vary long because i just moved to a new school so i just meet him and thought he was a pretty cool guy, he invited me to go fishing with him so i decided to give it a shot. We woke up after only sleeping two hours the night before because we were up all night messing around having a @CAPS1 time. The alarm went off at @TIME2 and we were dead tired, we got the boat ready and we were on our way to the @LOCATION1 river, we go there and unloaded the boat in the river it was by far the coldest i have been and not sure if i was going to have fun because i was wet cold and tired finally the sun came out and it started warming up and we were out on the water by @TIME1 and had the polls ready. We drove the boat to the spot were we were going to fish everyone was saying we are dumb for going to that spot because it was no @CAPS1 but my friends dad was one of the best fisherman i have met so i just went with the flow they taught me a few pointers and before i knew it we were catching fish having a @CAPS1 'ol time. By about the middle of the day it was lunch time but no one really wanted to eat because we were catching so many fish so we waited a while and finally started lunch, talking about all the fish we have caught and all the fun we have had. as the day went on and the sun got lower and lower a long with the tempeture we caught a bunch more fish and it was about time to get off the water so we all limited out and went back to the dock to load the boat back on the trailer and head back home, on the way home all we could talk about was fishing that day and how much fun it was and how many fish we caught.	13	15	28
21529	8	"                                  ""@CAPS1 @DATE1"" @CAPS2 my brother graduated @CAPS1 year it was a great time in our lives . We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1 my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS2 he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS2 she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS2 we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS2 we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION1 before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON1 almost caught a huge @NUM1 inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.  "	20	18	38
21535	8	" You know when you're talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time @DATE1 when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think its so funny that you laugh so hard you cry? I remember days like those, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out laughter is usually involved. To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny. Laughter brings people together even on the worst days.  Everyone has those awkward times when you're talking to someone who you aren't having the best of relationship with but yet you have to make due and try to make it less awkward. There's also the random joke when someones upset to try to lighten the mood. When you get someone to laugh its so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and its easier to talk with less tension. I've had plenty of days when I've gotten into a fight with a friend and I've had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or if they are judging you as you speak. But you know they aren't when you can get them to laugh because then they aren't really thinking badly of you. It also helps the tension. There's also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you. Sure there's still tension cause of the fact that they are crying but joking about it or trying to get them to smile or laugh does help distract them and get them in a better mood. It's said that ""Laughter is the shortest distant between two people."" and I think that's true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you. Also if you can have a good laugh with someone they are more likely to become a friend of yours since you know how to make them laugh and it's fun to talk to you. The more you and a friend can joke and laugh together the more close you usually tend to get with them cause you enjoy spending time with them and you're more comfortable with them and you know them better. And also when you can joke freely with someone you can usually also talk freely to them about anything and you know they'll be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to. I know that I personally love to hear funny stories, I never really have many of my own that I remember. I love hearing jokes and laughing with my friends. It always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know. But most people tend to giggle or smile when uncomfortable too. You know those times when someones having an awkward conversation with you and they ask a question you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you cam do is giggle and smile when they look at you expecting to answer. Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you just laugh and keep messing up your sentences cause you don't want to mess up. I don't know if laughing when you're uncomfortable is just a way to make it less awkward or because you're too confused on what else to do. Sometimes when you get awkward and laugh it can make it even more awkward when they just find it weird and sometimes it helps when they then joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward.  Even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry. It is also said that's ""Laughter is the greatest medicine."" I also agree with that because when you laugh you always tend to be in a greater mood and when you're in a better mood you tend to feel better in any way and you also tend to be more positive about things. Laughter brings people together in awkward, sad, good, or just normal conversations. The better you can relate to someone, the more you guys can joke together, the more comfortable you are with that person. Your day is always brightened when you share a good laugh with a friend, a classmate, a parent, anyone, even a stranger. It always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days."	20	15	35
21536	8	 Have you ever had a memorable time, where you laughed so hard with friends or family? Well I know I have had several of those times with my friends and family. I love those times that you laugh so hard your stomach starts aching really bad.  First, one of my most recent memorable laughing moments I spent with my mom that I don't see often. So this moment meant a lot to me as you can imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and I we went bowling. She brought her friend down with her as well. My brother and I hadn't bowled in a very long time, but we knew we would still beat them. It turns out my mom beat me though. We had a lot of great laughs over that, actually I think that was the first time I wasn't a sore loser. Although, I'm still not sure how she beat me, she would through the ball down the lane sideways and some how it would go right down the middle. When you have moments like these, that you can look back on to help you through the hard times, it's really inspirational. All in all we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom.  Another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Every once in awhile my dad, brother and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. They can be about my mom, school, our animals or all three of our compassion for sports. These talks always mean a lot to me because we never spend much time together. We don't get to spend much time together because my brother and me are always at school or in some kind of sport and my dad is always at work. These conversations have several effects on me sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better about things. There are so many laughable moments just in our living room. One thing we always like to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason he thinks he has to add another @CAPS1 in front of the @CAPS2 so it spells alblum. My brother and I enjoy making fun of him for that but we all have our moments we like to laugh at each other for. That was just one of the many things we love to laugh about.  Sometimes laughter is a very important part in someones life. For someone who is on the edge, or upset, just saying something little to make them smile or laugh makes all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and excepted, also a great way to put people back on track when they're down. I know smiles and laughing makes me feel so much better inside. I hope you have had some great laughing moments spent with the people you love and care about.	15	20	35
21557	8	" Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  ""@CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" @CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter."	18	25	42
21575	8	 To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter @MONTH1 some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as @CAPS1 someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when @CAPS2 hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle @CAPS2 not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to. @CAPS2 shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy @CAPS4 of us. I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset. And when someone asks him what Is wrong or @CAPS1 he Is okay @CAPS2 seems that he just gets more angry. So me being one of his closer friends I try and help him with that, and so far @CAPS2 has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being In a better mood @CAPS2 makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. @CAPS1 I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter. Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that @CAPS2 brings people closer, so use @CAPS2 don't be afraid.	15	15	30
21582	8	" I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities. I have lots of stories of when I have maid people laugh. One time i was on my way to camp with some of my friends and I looked out the window and saw a sign. ""@CAPS1 butts, unless, that ""@CAPS2"" is an ""@CAPS3"" @CAPS7 @CAPS8 must be @CAPS1 @CAPS4."" I said. @CAPS8 was so funny i maid everyone in the car laugh. @CAPS7 later on, on the drive to camp with my friends we stopped at @CAPS5 in some city. When we stopped there I got inside a shopping basket and my friends and I were racing down the isles and maid all the other costumers laugh. When we where going to leave I bought a whole bunch of food. When we were back inside the car I crabbed the box of doughnuts I had bought and let everyone else in the car have one. We all started eating them and we had established that the doughnuts where really gross. The doughnuts tasted so dry, @CAPS8 was like they didn't even have any frosting on them. I opened my chocolate milk and I had to drink my chocolate milk with my doughnut just to make @CAPS8 taste a little bit more sweet. None of us had anymore doughnuts. @CAPS8 was so funny, we threw the doughnuts out the window. On the way back from the camp that we had gone to, my friend @PERSON1 was driving home and I sat behind him and I messed with him so much. I had turned my phone up onto its highest volume and played a scary ring-tone and I scared him and maid him jump. @CAPS7 I had licked my finger and put @CAPS8 inside his ear @CAPS7 he freaked out, because he thought @CAPS8 was really gross. After that he had his window open and I opened my window and stuck my hand around and grabbed his arm and scared him. @CAPS7 we had stopped by the store in some small town and god some soda and I bought a soda to drink. When we got back in the car and left I Said: ""@CAPS6't get pulled over, I just opened a beer. Haha."" @CAPS7 I took a drink of my soda and as I took the drink I started laughing again and some of my soda went up into my nose @CAPS7 I said: ""@CAPS8 burns so bad. My nose is burning."" All of us where laughing. The ironic part was that like thirty minutes after i had said that we got pulled over. We where driving down the highway and my friend @PERSON1 who was driving thought that the speed limit was sixty-five miles-per-hour but the speed limit was fifty-five. The cop pulled him over and clocked him doing seventy-five. I was gonna try and make the cop laugh, to see if we could lighten him up a little, but my friend @PERSON1 said no because he was so mad. He ended up getting a ticket and the cop was a real idiot. He looked at the license plate and @CAPS7 turned and asked @PERSON1 if they where @LOCATION1 plates, when clearly they said right on them @LOCATION1. Everyone in the car laughed so hard @CAPS8 was hilarious. The cop was really dumb. I @CAPS6't think that anyone who went with me to camp that weekend stopped laughing. I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities."	19	15	34
21594	8	"      It was midsummer, and i could feel the cool ocean breeze washing over my skin. You would think everything would be calm, but it was the exact oppasite.I wouldnt talk to him or even look at him. He was trying so hard to get me to laugh but i just couldnt. I was so furious with him that i thought nothing between us would ever bee the same again. I thought that our three months together was up, and it scared me so much. He left for his trip the next day, and he left without saying a word.       I cried myself to sleep for a week. I knew he was back in town already, but he hadent called or said anything to me. After weeks of wondering and waiting, i could feel th at it was over. I talked to my sister and she told me that he would come around again and i had to be patient. I tried to take her words in my heart and i wanted to believe that it was true. I called his house everynight, but everynight i got the same answer, ""he's not home, but i'll let him know you called"". i wanted to believe that i would hear from him, so to pass the time i kept my self busy with cleaning and going out with my family. A couple of day's of not thinking and worrying about him did me good. I was smiling and laughing again. I felt like i could begin to breath a little and have fun. My sister's advice ended up working cos a week later he called me and told me that he wanted to see me. I told him he could come by @DATE1 and that i was very excited to see him again. The call ended and i was smiling from ear to ear.            The next couple of day's i was in a complete fenzy, getting everything clean, figuring out what i was going to wear. Everyone thought i was going crazy, but the truth is that i was scared. Scared of what he will say to me, and were we would go from here. Th days seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew, he was knocking on my door. I let him in and he took my by surprise with a big hug. We sepnt hours jsut talking and listening to music. It was as if nothing had ever changed. Before we knew it it was dark out and he was leaving. I walked him to the front of my trailer park, and he sat me down on the side walk and took my hand's. I was shocked and didnt know what to do but listen. He told me that he was sorry for the way he acted and that tonight he realized how much he wanted to be with me, and that he was completely in love with me. I couldnt do anything except cry and laugh at the same time, and soon enough he was laughing with me. I couldnt have asked for a more perfect moment.      It's been six months since @TIME1. We are better than ever becuase we have the laughter. It's what help's keep our relationship solid, and it keep's us close. Everyone need's a little laughter in there life. Im glad that i found someone special enough to always keep me laughing. It's like we never stopped. If you ever feel hopeless and like there's nothing for you. Remember to laugh, it's what makes the world go round."	17	15	32
21607	8	 LAUGHTER @CAPS1 knows that laughter is a healing medicine. It has the power to ease a lot of aches and pains, such as the hole in someone's heart after a breakup or the suffering of someone unable to provide for their family. However, the kind of aches laughter eased in my life was the pain from the loss of a dear friend and teacher. Recently, one of the best teachers I've gotten the chance to know passed away. He was trying to get into the @ORGANIZATION1 to set up his lesson plans for the @TIME1, when the fatal incident happened. <@NUM1</@CAPS2> had a doctor's appointment that day and had gotten a substitute to take his place. It was six o'clock in the @TIME1 and still dark out as @PERSON2 tried to open the doors of the @ORGANIZATION1. Before he knew it, he was down on the ground waiting for someone to come help. Eventually, @PERSON1, the janitor, came out, spotted him and quickly called @NUM2. The ambulance hustled to come pick him up and rushed him to the hospital for emergency care. As soon as they got there, they found out he had had a heart attack. He'd had a couple minor ones before this one. However, this heart attack was big. It took his life and they weren't able to revive him. @PERSON2 was pronounced dead on the day of @DATE1.  Our principle called for an emergency assembly when we all had arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 that @TIME1. We had known something was wrong, considering the strange looks on all of our teachers' faces. All the students gathered together in the small gym of our @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. The air was filled with anticipation as we waited for something to happen. After a bit, a man we all knew walked out in front of us with a microphone in his hand. With slumped shoulders and a grim face, @PERSON3, our principle, told us of the tragic news. My mouth fell open and I gasped. I could hear people adjusting in their seats and murmuring among themselves as they struggled to take in the devastating news. Looking around, I saw the same shocked expressions on @CAPS1 of my classmates' faces. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't just yet. @PERSON3 explained the situation further as we intently listened to the sickening words coming out of his mouth. I was in shock. I didn't believe that @PERSON2 was gone.  After our principle was finished speaking, we were ushered out of the gym by melancholy teachers and told to report to our first period class. As I made my way to my locker, I heard sobbing, but it was mostly silent. I quickly grabbed the folder for my first class and closed the locker, wanting to get out of the hallway and into a more private area. Walking into the classroom, I sat at my desk. People in my class filed in through the door and took their seats as well. Our teacher for that class didn't talk to us, so we presumed we weren't doing anything. Sitting there in silence and feeling helpless I put my head down on my desk and started to cry. It really happened, I thought to myself. The reality of the @TIME1 was setting in.  By the end of first period, the sleeve of my sweatshirt was drenched in tears and mascara. Nobody had really said anything, but that was okay. Seeing that I had been crying, people stopped to hug me as I sluggishly walked down the hallway to my second period class. I expected my next class to be a lot like the first, but it wasn't. In place of the cold silence, was the soft sound of music. Instead of crying by themselves, people were being comforted by friends. Students were making cards for @PERSON2's family. We were all reminiscing the good times we had with @PERSON2. We retold the stories he told us of his life in the classes he taught. We remembered the funny crack he would get in his voice when he raised it in even the slightest way. We laughed when we remembered how he couldn't hang up anything straight and that the evidence was on his classroom walls. For the first time in that already long day, we felt alright. We felt as if we could celebrate his life, not mourn it.  The rest of the day was alright. Not because we lost a great teacher, but because we could love and appreciate a great teacher. Laughter eased the pain and sorrow of that dreadful day. We could remember and laugh about the good times we had in the classroom with him throughout our @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1 years. We could remember the man @PERSON2 was through the small tickle in our bellies. Laughter brought us together in a time of need.	25	23	48
21624	8	Sometime ago on a hot @DATE1 day my @NUM1 ,@PERSON3 ,@PERSON1, @PERSON4 ,and @PERSON2. Wanted to do something that could give us relief from the extream heat. So we sat down and talked to find out what we could do and were we wanted to go. So @PERSON7 had a few ideas one was go over to @LOCATION3 house were there was an air conditioning his other idea was to walk @NUM2 miles to @CAPS1 swim hole, but the only reason he wanted to go was because his girlfriend would be there,really know one hates @CAPS1 but no body wanted to walk that far in the heat ,then walk back to @CAPS3 @NUM3 had three ideas number one of his ideas was walk to his uncles house @NUM4 miles away to see if we could catch a ride to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, his second idea was to go down to our friends @PERSON5's house and go swim in his built in pool, his third idea was to to go in the back yard i spray our selves with the hose. @PERSON1 had two ideas one was to see if he could get his mom to lend him some money to fill his tank and to pay her back,his other idea was to drive to the coast and camp there for a few days if he got the money from his mom.Byran had three ghetto ideas one was to go jump in the water fountain by the @ORGANIZATION1 then quickly get out before we got in trouble, second idea was to go over to the @LOCATION4...A.K.A. the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and hop over the fence and then he was going to let us in, his third idea was to go over to the old people homes and swim in there pool there because he said he knew a @NUM5 had three ideas one was to walk a mile to to the forks , second was to walk down to the creek @NUM4 miles away third idea was to get a whole bunch of fans and run them threw out @CAPS3 room.
