28	1	Dear Newspaper, Computers are high tec and have expanded in an everyday thing. They play a big role in society. Computers have been improved to do many different things without them we would barely get any thing done. Although kids should start goind outside more, computers teaches kids new things, and it is useful. With computers kids are rarely going outside. A lot of our population of the @LOCATION1 are obese, including kids. Because of this they are staying inside and on their computer. Kids need to go outside evry once and while to get some fresh air and exercise. If they limit their time on the computer and do some active game it would be better for the child. Since computers are rapidly growing and adapting kids spend half of the day on it just stareing at the screen playing some flash game, like run escape. Instead of wasteing their time doing that they should go outside, take a walk just do something! Computers teaches kids new things. Google something like trees. You would get bunch of websites containg information about trees. Kids also play games, if they don't know it, some of the games they play are teaching them stuff, for an example, my little sister, goes on a site called nickeloden.com I see that right and it teaches her stuff she didn't know before. from those types of games it prepared her for kindergarden. Now a days more and more sites keep adapting and becoming known like bing. Computers are real useful. suppose you want to know whats goind on at work. So click your mouse on internet explorer and get your email. With computers, you could go on social networking sites, like facebook and connect with friends. You can also go on instant messageing site to talk to friends and see what there up to. For your entertainment you could play games. Remember though to not stay on too long. Computers are big deal in our community. Life would be very difficult without them. But remember not to stay on too long! Although kids should start going outside, computers, teaches kids new things, and is useful.	5	4	9
81	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it does not effect on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet effects your everyday life in a good way.	4	4	8
95	1	"Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they effect us in a posotive way. Computers can help us explore far away places that we @MONTH1 never go to. Maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homeworks. One reason why I think computers are only helping us is they help us explore othe places. I know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. But not at all of us can afford to travel far away. Most families however, do have computers. With these computers, kids with a parents permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place. ""I have always wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but my parents just don't have the proper incomg"" said @PERSON1 of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 school @CAPS4 I used my @CAPS6 and the internet to discover. HUNDREDS of amazing facts on it."" @CAPS4 as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams. Another reason why I think computers are good is they help you connect with friends. If you are like me, you like to talk to your friends. A @CAPS5! But sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. A solution a new wonderful machine called. The @CAPS6! You can chat long distances without being for it. This is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @LOCATION2. I thoughy I would never talk to him again. Then I learned about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. It allows you to talk whenever you want, whenever you want! Now, me and my friend can stay in touch and @CAPS4 can you! My finale reason as to why I think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. Even have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? How about the capital of a state that visit, slipped your mined? Well the @CAPS6 can solve both of those problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator. For the other @PERCENT1 you can download and install softwear onto your @CAPS6 for a low price. And every @CAPS6 made in this world has internet capabilities. All's you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride! @CAPS4 don'y worry about too much @CAPS6 use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. @CAPS4 remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. they also help us connect with no another, and help us excel in school. @CAPS4 get on, and get goin. Have you used your @CAPS6 today?"	5	5	10
98	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this new digital age, computors are beaming more and more advanced. You can do just about anything with computors now from talking to people, to learning about faraway places. It is not all as wonderful as it seems, though for people's lives have been ruined because of the internet. It is for that reason that computors are not a benefit to our society. With computors we can learn anyting, go shopping, and contact friends. For many, this deletes the purpose of going outside. You can live your entire life indoors. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity. Also, living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family. In order to use computors wisely, we have to learn how to balance computor time with an active lifestyle. The problem is, not many people do that. Furthermore, going online too much has been known to produce a second life. With websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 you can have a whole different online life, with friends that you haven't even seen before. Sometimes, people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it. Take @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 for example. It is very popular, but also extremly addicitve. Some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing. Same with @CAPS6 of @CAPS7. This obsession with online games or @CAPS8 is not what internet was made for. Also, peoples lives and reputations have been ruined by computors. Cyber bullying is spreading like wildfire. Its anonymous, and can be detrimental to the lives of others. Internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away. There is one video of a college guy playing with a golf hall retriever like asword called @CAPS9 kid. The video has been viewed over @NUM1 million times. The guy in the video was made fun of for years, sued the people who put the tape online, and was forced into depression. Moving on, people can literally get their lives taken away with computors too. Identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common. Even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year. Computors must help, but they can hurt much more. In conclusion, computors are a detriment to society. the can hurt people, cause addiction, and seclude your life. Surely this isn't the grounds for something to help society. Truly this is a good thing to let people use.	5	6	11
104	1	Dear The @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has been an argument wheter computers do or do not have a positive effect on people. Some believe, that computers have negative effets on people for example spending too much time, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. However, I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, lets people know about faraway places, and allows people to talk online. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. Did you know hand-eye coordination can be helpful at times? Well, it true because if you are in distress and the phone is broken and you don't have a cellphone then send an emergency e-mail to one of your friends informing them to call all and since you have hand-eye coordination you can type without having to look down. Also if your in college and have an important essay due tomorrow then hand-eye coordination can really help you write down notes without having to look back at the writing paper. Finally, with hand-eye coordination it can help you can join the army because if you spot a threat you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after threat attacks. To conclude, computers teaches hand-eye coordination. Have you ever wanted to go to a forgein places? Well with computers you can do that you can just search the place and see what the place has. Fethermore, if you want to learn to speak a forgein language you can all you have to do is type in the language with a question and search its so easy a baby can do it. Finally, if you want to learn how to cook like forgein places do then type in the type of food or its name and search. To summarize, computers lets people know about forgein places. Have you ever have the feeling that you want to talk to somebody? I know I have this is why computers can help you talk to people online just tree the person's e-mail adresses and type the message. Also you don't have to waste money on paper and envelopes. Finally, having an e-mail is free so you can talk all you want. To conclude, computers help people talk online. In summarization, computers have a positive effect on people. It helps them have hand-eye coordination, learn about new places, and lets them talk.	5	5	10
105	1	"Computers are used world wide everyday, and most of the time @CAPS2 is used for a good reason. Computers help out by making @CAPS2 possible to get all the info you want, like for a trip. @CAPS1 you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant you @MONTH1 use a computer so you know how far. Computers also help out, making @CAPS2 possible to talk to friends that you haven't seen for years. @CAPS2 is also great way to meet new people. Let's say you are really stressed at work or school and you forget your book, you can usually bring @CAPS2 up on the computer and do @CAPS2 there. First, computers help out with traveling, sight seeing and lots more. When you travel, dont you want to know everything? And the biggest detail you want to know is the cost and the computer can usually give you a close to exact price for everything. Now that help's out a bunch when your traveling the world. And also when your site seeing you usually want to find either the most amazing or romantic spot were you are. And @CAPS1 you type in ""the most romantic spot in somers"" @CAPS2 should come up with a bunch of spots. So dont drive to miles just to get a map or brochure, use your computer and print one off. Second, @CAPS1 there was a friend you haven't seen in years and you want to talk, you can go on the computer. The computer helps in so many ways @CAPS2 could even tell you were this person lives and you could surprise visit him/her. When your on the computer, you can even meet new friends and have conversations with them. and even meet them someday. And @CAPS1 you and that new friend get along then mabey you and that person could be best friends. So @CAPS1 you haven't seen or talked to someone in a while that you knew use the computer to have a chat. Third, say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork. Were do you go? the computer, @CAPS2 can bring most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done. @CAPS1 you forgot your homework book, you dont want to get a falling grade. on this homework. So you go to your computer from there. And @CAPS1 you forgot your paper work, and @CAPS1 you didn't finish this project for work tonight you would be fired, you could just go on the computer, find the work and finish @CAPS2. Also save your job. So that why computers help out so much in this lifetime. Last, that is why in this lifetime you need computers. They help us with our vacation trips. They help with conversation with old friends we haven't seen forever. Also they help with your school and job work. At least @PERCENT1 of our population use computers every day and with out them our society would colaps/ @DATE1. So think about the decision you are making and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 will benefit our society or make our society @DATE1 to its knees."	4	5	9
120	1	Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to.	4	4	8
130	1	Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.	5	5	10
137	1	Dear, news paper I think computers are good, this is because you can learn thing's about faraway places using them, you can also hear about the most recent news and you can communicate with people. In school a lot of the research projects on other places focus on other places around the world. When you use a computer you can read articles about the place and also get pictures and use them in a slideshow or photo story. Their are also educational websites that kids can go on to learn their math facts to multuplication tables @CAPS1 the computer is a good learning tool. The computer can keep you up-to-date with the news to! their are news website that post minute to minute things about world news and tell the world what kind of desaster happened in some far away place on the other side of the world. A lot of the time families are spread all over the world, you can chat with family or friend's that have moved by a simple chat room and you can catch up on what has been happening in each other's lives and that's a good tool for family to stay in touch @CAPS1 the computer has lots of benefits that a lot of people all around the world can use, from learning. About a faraway country to chatting with cuson that lives in california and also knowing whats going on in your own home town.	3	4	7
157	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much time do you spend on the computer daily, @NUM1 hour, @NUM2 hours. While computers, are amazing advances in technology they are also very bad for you. People spend hours at at time on the computer causing less time exercing, horrible speaking, and dangerous searches. From @DATE2 to @DATE3 the numbers of obese people increased from @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION2 citizens to @PERCENT1. In a recent study the amount of families with computers is now @NUM3 out of @DATE1 compared to the @NUM4 out of @DATE1 in @DATE4. Scientist wonder if they were connected and relized they were. People who spent hours on the computer live a sedentary life style. They are more likly to go on the computer than go exercise. The lack of exercising causes obeseity, and cardovascular problems. Without this valuable exercise more people are . At a visit to the hospitial a surgen said he has seen a huge increase of heart surgreys in the @DATE1. We found that the computer manual booklets says to only go on for an @NUM1 hour at a time. The hottest thing online these days is social networking, whether @CAPS6's twitter, or facebook. These social networking allow teens to talk with there friends. But @CAPS6 really isn't talking. For example they write @CAPS3 @CAPS4 going @NUM2 dance. Not only is the spelling wrong but also the grammer. And this language doesnt just stay online, @CAPS6 is now now they talk. @PERSON1 the grandmother to a social networking said, ""I can't even have conversations with her because she is is talking like she is on the computer. @CAPS6's so sad."" @CAPS5 for public speaking and english class, @PERSON2 an english teacher for @NUM7 @DATE1 states @CAPS2 she has seen a drop in teens ability to write gramaticly correct and @CAPS2 when she corrects essay the are written is social networking form. ""@CAPS6's hard to see litiature dissolving because kid are spending so much time on the computer. The average day for children in @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 is to go home and going on the computer for hours at a time until a parent comes home. @CAPS2 would you like your child to be surfing the internent alone without you for hours when you don't know what they are doing. Parent blockers can only do so much. Children can find out the password and net around @CAPS6. The dangers are always there. You can get a lot of good information on the internet but you can also get a lot of bad information. You dont know what your child is searching or who they are talking to on the computer, @CAPS6 could be ""@CAPS8,"" the who lives four blocks over."	5	4	9
176	1	Computers and the @CAPS1 were a technological break through. It exposed to the average world, things that were never thought possitive. But as these things advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so bad of an addiction its begun to threaten peoples lives I've been given a choice to s'de with the addicting computers, or to offose them. The only clear choice is to offose. First off, computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise. Studies show @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who use a computer, do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world, nations are becoming more over weight. This is a huge problem in the united states computers are main cause to why the @CAPS2.S is over weight and unhealthy by cutting down computers use, we can get our world back into great shape we can bring exercise and health back. Nextly, I'm sure you've all heard of online predators. It's scary just to think about, well as computer technology increased online predators numbers went up. I remember a couple of years ago, I was watching the news and a story came a normal teenage girl, being killed by someone she meton myspace. things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen are in creasing. by putting people on computers you're putting then at risk of death this is an extreme problem computers have caused. Thus is the last efferct computers have, out of many that I'm going to state time on the computer, is time taken away from family and friends.This can ruin relationship in and outside the family. Now I'm sure you now many people have become extremely addicted to online games. the more they play these games the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved computers are a leading cause in disfunctional families. they steal the user away from the outside word. these people need to get their families and friends back. You have to act now, before its too late and computers have over taken the world. If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction, do what you can to help get them back we need to cutt back on any kind of computer use fast. Hurry, it's now or never.	5	5	10
192	1	How @MONTH1 times do you use the computer in one day? A lot right? I think that computers definatly benefit society. The internet helps a lot of people, because its very conveniant computer give people. The computers also lets people talk online with other people. Computers help people because of the internet. The internet makes alot of peoples live easier. One way is for school. I know from my own experiences that the internet helps. If I dont have enough material to study, on the internet help. Another reason that the internet is helpful is for jobs. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of people the age of @NUM1 have jobs on the internet? The internet can also help people find jobs. The last reason that the internet is helpful is shopping, I remember a time when i needed a special book for school and no book store and no bookstore, my mum ordered it of fine, the internet is very helpul to many people. My that computers are beneficial to our society is that they people the ability to faraways places. many people cannot offerd to go to a lot of places outside the united state., With computers, people can team about there places and at of these places. Sometimes there is even a snow the experience of being there. Another reason that are using and want to learn more. Once, any family got to a wedding in @LOCATION1, but we didn't know much @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 we went online to find things like. The foods eaten there and what the weather is like. lastly people can learn about where their family corner form. If people know the place that their ancestors came from, but they look it up crime computers. They confind recipes for food, what relign they practice, and what holidays they celebrate. Obuously computer help people about faraway places. My last reason that computers are beneficial to or society is that they allow people to talk with other people. Sometimes, good friends who wants to together loss touch or if one friend, people can find online and take. Did you know that their are many sites that tell you where people you went to highschool with are? Also, there are sites like facebook where people can connect. Another reason is that, people can meet other people online. their are many dating sites such as, that connect people losing that internet. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of people on dating, sites set ? Sometimes people cannot call each other because its too long distance. Being able to chat onlinee a sites like google, chat or all is very helpul. Without a dubt, computer are very helpful. I think that computer help @CAPS1 many, people in our society. People use the internet to help them. People learn about other places and people ccan chat online. -@CAPS1, dont think body about computers, because they have impaced our society greatly!	6	5	11
214	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 your at home and you are on the computer. But its been hours maybe even days since you've takin a breath of fresh air outside. This @MONTH1 sound cpzy, yet it is a reality for over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of the population in @LOCATION1. Just loo around they are in movies, chain resurant at your home, in your office and even in schoold; computers are everywhere. I know that because of over using computers amny experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, I say that because of this peopel every where shold only be allowed to use the computer on a rain everday, say @CAPS2 to computers. My point is with computers our days are wasted with vertual games and other downloads. For starter, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Over the past two years obeseity has become a major issue in @LOCATION1 with over @PERCENT1 of the population obeseity causesan ectreamly higher risk of getting diseases and sickness like diabeaties, heart failure and even depression. recently my cousin passed away from canser caused by her fat or obeseity. My point is we can't sit her doing nothing get up and get moving away from that computer in addition to this people should get off computers and start enjoying nature. A total of <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of personals in @LOCATION1 don't spend enough time out side. With global warning killing our environment people would care enouhg to psend a little girl of their time outside. didi you know that more and more of the environment is disappering each day? I went to my good friends and expert on all things envieronmental from the instate of clean our world or cow. 	4	4	8
215	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am expressing my concern to you about the side effect new technologies, such as computers have an humans. Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise. People also do not get to spend as much as their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family. Firstly, people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their time surfing the net. Study show that an average @CAPS1 spends in total @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending on it. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 technology society, says' that if this increases @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on the internet, continues for more years, most @CAPS3 will completly lose contact with family and friends outside @ORGANIZATION1 the social computer network. The average weight @ORGANIZATION1 a @NUM2 year old has increased from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1, to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics show that the main caus for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the acessive amount @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on computers in addition @CAPS4 do not have as much time to exercise. Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each. @CAPS5 the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym. All @ORGANIZATION1 these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising. Secondly, comuters are effecting the people get to go outside and enjoy nature. Form my personal experience nature is a beautiful thing to be apart @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 now adays I spend way too much time on social networks such as facebook, my space and @CAPS6 others. How often do you go outside to take a walk, fo for a bike ride or something else? A study done by @PERSON2 shows that the average person living in @LOCATION1 have only spent a total @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM5 days outside in the past two years after reciving their new computer. This must change people need to enjoy what this world has to offer. Thirdly, computers have effected the interaction between family and friends. ""@CAPS6 people hav only been interacting with family at mandatory times such as school meetings."" says @ORGANIZATION1. Family and friends are a major importance in everyones lives. I love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup @ORGANIZATION1 hot chocolate. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people now a days do not spend anytime with family and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people use computers to interact with friends. It is vitally important that people stop using computers because ""before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends"" says @PERSON1 from I.U.M Computers help people lose communication and interaction with fmily and friends. In conclusion, I urge you to make the right desion by quitting using computers and in return will be a much happier and stronger individual. Computers impact humans in a terrible way because people spend too much time on them leading to a lack in exercise, time spent outside and in addition interaction between friends and family. Sorry about the lack @ORGANIZATION1 organization towards the end, I ran out @ORGANIZATION1 space. Please excuse the mess. Thank you."	5	5	10
219	1	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has lately come to my attention that people were saying that computers aren't important. Well, I strongly disagree with that statement. I think computers teach excellent hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even allow you to chat online with family and friends. Computers teach a lot of hand eye coordination. Study's show that @PERCENT1 of all football players have excellent hand eye coordination. I'm sure this is because after the football players get home from a big game or something they log into @CAPS2 and make thier status all about thier win. Plus, they probably pull up pingball and see how long they can go without getting the little ball down the hole. Do you have good hand eye coordination? My second reason that I disagree with the previous statement would have to be that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places without ever leaving home I mean @CAPS1 is so much faster than having to go to the library. At the library you would have to first get there, secend pick out your book, and third check @CAPS1 out. with a computer in all that time you could be completely finished with you whole project! Finally, the reason why computers are so important is because @CAPS1 keeps people in touch. Do you have family members who live far away from you? I @CAPS3 I do. I can't always call them on the phone @CAPS4 I want to talk to them so I just log on to @CAPS2 and if there online I can have my conversation with that person. I don't @CAPS3 about you but I'm really close to my grandma. Unfortanitly she doesn't even live anywhere close to @NUM1 hours to me. She's way down @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. By car thats one and a half days and by plane thats three hours! So @CAPS1's so much easier to log on @CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her rather than driving a day and a half or flying for three hours. So in conclusion I'm sure you totally agree with me. Computers are just amazing! They help you get hand eye coordination, let you research something super quick, and let you stay in touch with far away friends and family.	4	5	9
232	1	"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world."	6	6	12
235	1	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I feel that computers are a great in most people lives. One you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you in many ways. It shouldnt affect dailey schedule or just being with your family. People can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer. For example, you can play games all different kinds, you can also chat with people, litsen to music, watch videos, look for places and a whole lot more. Computers are very useful in many different ways. Computers are also good for you. They help with you eye cordination. You can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. The internet also has a lot of eduacting games whiten is good for people who had that extra help. It also helps you with you hand cordinations because on the computer you need to know how to type. you get realy good at it you can type without looking. A computer can not get between you dailey schedule or whay u do with your family. Because a computer is a computer you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun for example i havea computer at my house and someone goes on it everyday and it never affect what everybody does us kids still go to school my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. As my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses. One you can use them for almost everything. Two computers are good for you. Three i shouldnt affect your daily schedule in anyway.	3	4	7
254	1	I walked into my living room. I saw my brother on the computer talking to his friends on facebook. I thought to my self he's always on the computer never for any school reason. People always says we don't need computers I personaly agree with the statement. In the town @ORGANIZATION1 everybody mostly has computers. Without a computer to look up for content things, you have to go to the library and check out a bank. Just the other @DATE1 my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culter. He loved that book he read it @DATE1 in and @DATE1 out, he read it for a book report on different culters. When he handed it into the teacher the @DATE1, when he reached the classroom the teacher looked @CAPS2 happy when she gave him back his test he had an @NUM1. He didn't use the internet your computers not mobile like a book if you wanted to learn about something while your traveling in you car you can't plug your computer in and use it unlike a book. Also books are usually funnier to read. Not haveing a computer can conclude to a lot more things like exercising. While my brother is inside all @DATE1 me and my friends are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kirkball, and dogeball. We are very thin because @CAPS3 what we do almost every @DATE1. Unlike my brother were he is obeast because @CAPS3 all he done were before he had the computer he was as thin as us. It is also unhealth to be on the computer all @DATE1 because that can lead to staying update at night, don lead to missing the bus, and also lead to bad grades. Where when we are done with are gaine we whatch a little t.v.. then go to sleep to regain our energy we usually have atleast @NUM2 hrs. of sleep ever @DATE1 which lets us make it through school. We also make the right choses in food to eat to have more energy such as fruit and vegitibales. Were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity. Not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family. When we go out to eat my brother is always in a push to get back on to the computer dosen't let us enjoy our food. He usually is @CAPS2 much in a rush he picks off of other people's @CAPS2 they would be finished faster, when every one wants to enjoy then food. When we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer. Even if we buy a movie and whatch it at home he won't whatch it with us he's on the computer. It really makes my mom, dad, brothers, and sisters mad that he won't do any thing but play on the computer. Even when are whole family gose out side to play a sport he won't come out and play. It's like he's not part of the familiy anymore. Its like he forgot we were even @CAPS3 the reason why I think computes should be in the state of @LOCATION1. If can lead to and relly bad grades. @CAPS2 if you want your kids healthier, better grades, and spend more time with your family then ethier sell your computer or This is happening all over the world.	5	5	10
281	1	"Dear, Local Newspaper writer I believe that computers benefit our society because we could connect to people more faster and easier. And computers @CAPS1 good for our society because of we don't have to spend to much time on the phone. That @CAPS1 why I think computers benefits our society. ""@CAPS1 computers a good thing or bad thing?"" Computers are a good thing because you could email your family or friends any time you want too. But sometimes we don't have to be on the computer so long. That @CAPS1 why I think computers are a good thing. Without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or text message. In my opinion I am really thankful that we have computers. And on computers you could go on everything like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and even work on the computer. That @CAPS1 without computers it will be different. I think people are not spending to much time on the computer"", because a lot of people on the computer to do office work. Computer make things a lot easier for us! But sometimes people take advantage over it. That @CAPS1 why I feel people are not spending too much time on the computer. Last but not least that @CAPS1 why I know computers benefit's our society."	4	3	7
322	1	"Dear local news paper I believe the computer has a positive effect on people. It helps students with projects, helps people learn about other places, @CAPS1 it helps you find information on something you didn't know. @NUM1 precent of all teachers give out computer projects. Most reading teacher will have you read a book and then type a essay or a review about your book. Most teacher prefer the essay typed and not written. By the teacher giving that assignment he/she is giving the student the ability to explore out side of always writing. And I believe other students would agree with me, @CAPS2 better to type the essay than to write it! Is there a place out there that you really want to know more about, that you hope to someday visit? Well you can always use the computer to find out more about the place. You can use the computer to learn when is the best times to visit that place. @CAPS1 if you just heard on the news about a tradjic accident like the eartquake over in @LOCATION1, and you want to keep in touch on what is happening in that place you can use the computer. The computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday. Im sure almost every person has read a book and came accross a word they did not know or a student had spelling words that they didn't know what the words meant. Well you can use the computer to look up the words.The computer will give you the full deffinition and how to pronance the word. Computers @CAPS1 will help you find any information you @MONTH1 need, ""AND @CAPS3!"" In conclusion computers aren't just a thing that kids play on all day it helps you with many things like getting your work done, finding out about places, and finding out information about things you need to know, ""And @CAPS3!"""	4	4	8
324	1	I think computer have shaped @LOCATION1 to what it is today. Computer help people learn, give people a passtime, and all of that can be managed in a certain space of time so you still have time to go outside. Computers help everyone learn. It makes things easier by typing up essays because you could type it faster and its eaiser to make changes. Also, its cheaper to buy a computer and go on the internet and look up foreign countries then acually going there. Another example, is that a computer teachees you hand-eye coordination from typing and using the mouse. Finally, computers can teach you life lessons by reading articles another person wrote. Computers give bored people passtimes. One example, is that you can play computer games during rainy days or when you can't go outside. Also, you can talk to friends through facebook or aim. Another example, is that you can talk to distant family in another country by using programs such as skype. Finally, you can order stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store and the things you might order you can play with outside. A lot of people say computers keep kids inside don't know that their are ways to prevent this. One example is you can use shut-off timers that keep anyone from going onto the computer for to long. Also, many people learn how to manage their time on the computer. Another example, is that parents can make rules that their children aren't allowed to play games on the computer on certain days and/or times. Finally, you can keep the computers in the family room so that children don't play with it all night in their room. Those are just some of the many reasons why computer help @CAPS1. They help us learn, pass the time, and it can all be manage during a certain amount of time. Now reading this I hope you believe that computers benefit society.	4	4	8
329	1	Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to pick being for computers. There are a couple reasons why I'm for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn stuff, and you can also play video games. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to freinds online. So if you have a facebook or myspace you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend they will receive those exacte words then they'll reply. For example if you wanted to just say hi then your friend would look at his/hers messages then just reply. So being able to talk to friends online is one example why I for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn things. So if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site. What I mean is if you goto google a whole bunch of site's will come up, so what you want to do is find the fastest easyest site for you. So being abe to learn important things like a language is another reason I'm for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. What I mean is if you were borde and noone to talk to then you can get on your computer and play a mind numbing game or an educational game for class. For example in science class we played a game on the computer and it had to do with gravity and that was what we were learning about so it was an educatinola game. So that is the last reason why I'm for computers. I'm for computer because you can play games. So now you know why I'm all for computers. I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff and play video games.	4	4	8
330	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a possitive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a possitive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including chicken, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can go onto facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happend to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. Thiss guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity if has had on society but @DR1 the good the computer is doing."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands thousands of dollars on buying the computers and @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computers. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2, on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't go. Statistics show thas @PERCENT3 of families have waste their college money in computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1 do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth @CAPS1 your children at."	6	5	11
334	1	@ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer per family has increased greatly in the past @NUM1 years. In that same time people are getting fatter and they need more exercise. If you use the computer it might break or not work properly. Computers are a big waste in time and a bigger waste in money. In the past @NUM1 years many people @MONTH1 have gained a lot of weight. They do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online. Studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat then if you shop on line. Another reason why computers dont give you exerise is because of google. If you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to google and type it in. It is a much easier way to see sights but if you walk you could burn up to @NUM3 times as much calories then if you just look it up on google. Another reason why computers dont give you exercise is you can get addicted to a game. Lets say that you have basketball practice at @NUM1:00pm. If you go on the computer at @NUM5 then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice. You would be stuck on your computer mindlessly typeing a way on a computer game that doesnt help you anywere in life. When you dont go to practice you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight. Scients say that if you actully play a sport you can lose weight by up to @PERCENT1 then if you didnt. Before there computers life was simpole, no student forgot there homework. But now they use there computer many things can go wrong. First the printer can break. @CAPS1 year my printer stoped working @NUM1 times so I could not do my homework. My teacher said that forgetting my homework affectde my grade by over @PERCENT2. Another reason why handwriting is more convienet is you are capable of doing writing during school @CAPS1 year with my teacher @PERSON1 i had to write a prompt. She told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken. When I got down stairs she told me I had to write it so I got a @NUM7 because she could not read what I wrote. Every other kid got a @NUM8 or above but since I was not use to writing it affected my grade. Another reason why computers are inconvienet is when you need to do research. My parent got rid of our books a wile ago because of computers. So one day when I was home alone I had to reasearch euthonzing dogs on the computer but there was a power outage. I could not do my @ORGANIZATION1 events for science so I got a @NUM9 on it. That grade brought my adverage down form an a+ to an a-. The only reason why I got a bad grade because I depended on the computer for reasearch and it let me down. If I had better hand writing I would have gotten a better grade. The final reason why computers do not benifit society is because they are a waste of money. Most computers caust up to @MONEY1 for the computer and installing. There is no need for them because everything computers have a library can give. The library has books so you can reasearch with books insted of computers. In my house all @NUM7 people in my family has a computer but @NUM11 of the computers are used once a week. They are extreamly expensive and there is no need for them. Also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overcharging by @PERCENT3. With that extra @MONEY2 you could buy many books and magisnes insted of a computer. That is why computers are not useful. People are not getting exercise, so the gain @PERCENT1 more weight. It is much less convienent then writing by hand. Finally they are a major waste of money. The decads without computers were much more useful and everyone lived happpier.	5	5	10
366	1	Computers, Computers, Computers, its all we hear about today. New websites, chatrooms, games and much more. I agree with the experts who think that we should spend more time outdoors with friends and family. Computers take over peoples lives, you don't know who is looking you up on facebook or @CAPS4 and know you can do almost anything on them. Lunch...,@CAPS1...,@CAPS2...,@CAPS3....Computers are taking over our lives. Believe it or not some people bring computers everywhere they go and once you get on that @CAPS3 chances are you won't be getting of it for a while because you keep clicking and keep finding new stuff. I do have to say computers are a cool device but there has to be a limit. We can not be on the @CAPS3 @NUM1 looking up what @PERSON1 said to @PERSON2... You got to come back to earth and spend time with your family. The @CAPS3 might be a cool device but that does not meen that it is safe to post stuff about you on. Facebook & @CAPS4, probably two of the most dangerous sites to be on. Anybody could just type in @PERSON1 and get @NUM2 maches and find you eventhough you don't know them. People are not always as they say they are. People could say taht they are a @NUM3 year old. Just leaving college when it's really a @NUM4 year old @CAPS6 just getting ready to enter the senior center. Don't trust anybody. Now and days you don't even have to leave your house. You can shop, talk, @CAPS5 taxes, bills, and have a vurtual life on the @CAPS3. Pretty soon @CAPS6 kind as a human will become all together through the @CAPS3. Some computers probally have a smarter system then same humans do. What I am saying is limit your time to the @CAPS3 or thats where you will be spending it all. Know you know that I think that computers need to be seen less throughout the human day. Also that they are taking over our lives, are dargerous, and you don't even have to leave your house to make a living. I hope you take my thoughts into consideration. Thank you.	4	4	8
368	1	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Computers have helped us in many ways. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs and computers have helped law enforcement as well. Yes, i, agree some people do spend too much time on these machines, but that doesn't mean they haven't helped us. Computers help children and adults learn so much. Children can use their computer to re-search homework they're doing or even just research thing for fun. Most adults have been through school and are educated but computers help them make discoveries about space, the human body, etc. So not only are computers teaching children, but they're part of making new discoveries that need to be taught to children. Right now our economy is not doing to well. A ton of people are out of jobs and can't support their families. But imagine how many more people would be out of work if we didn't have computers. @PERCENT1 of our society works with computers. An that means @PERCENT1 of the people won't have jobs. Computers not only give us knowledge but they give over half us catch the members of society that do wrong. Computers have helped catch law enforcement for a little bit more than @NUM1 years. Yes, crime has gone up in the past years, but computers have helped us catch criminals. Computers store massive amounts of data, which means we can story already arrested criminal's finger prints, pictures, @CAPS2, previous record, etc. to help us catch criminals. So yes computers have helped us in more ways than one. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs, and helped law enforcement. Even if people spend too much time on thse machines, it's their decision and look how much computers have helped us. Make the right decision let out technology continue to edvance.	4	5	9
384	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers have a possitive effect on people? I know I @CAPS2. Computers are good for many reasons: @NUM1 reason is because people can learn about far away places; @NUM2 they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @NUM3 they can teach hand eye coordination. First off if you're taking you want to learn about where you are going. Computers can help with that! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you. You can @CAPS2 many things while talking to freinds on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderfull things. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurece bill. If you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. So thats why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver.	4	4	8
392	1	Many people like computer and like to use them for many different kinds of reason. Some people use them to get online education. Other use them to talk to family and friends that are far away. Also student use them to do research for school. These are reason why computer could be a good devices. There are many people that now have the ability to get a online education because of problem that they have. For example people that can't walk and don't like going to regular school. The computer would help them find website that they could get a free education. The computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher. The computer would make it so easy and better for the people that don't have the ability to walk they can even study for test that they have on the computer. This one reason why many people use computer. Many family use computer to try to look for freind that they haven't seen in a long time or family that are far away. They even contact them by chatting threw websites. They also search for addressed and phone number. Many people get to find there family threw internets. They meet in spot are even come to one another hauses. The computer would allow their dreams to happen by finding their familys. This would be an exciting event for them this why they need computer. This is one very important reason student use computer to research projects. Without computer student won't be able to look for information they need to know. The computer would teach student about people in the past they didn't know or didn't got to meet. The computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history. Children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher. These are some reason why I think we all need computer. We need them for people that don't have the ability to walk, for people that have family and friend far away, and for student that would like to learn more. These are all things people enjoy doing on a computer. If there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future. So this are some reason why many people decide to be on computer.	4	4	8
406	1	Dear local newspaper I disagree because people should just enjoying spending time with famimely and not on the computer  doing nothing do you agree with me so far? Frist of being if you wast all you're time being of the computer there is nothing there is nothing you can get done as I have notice many shildren are on computer every right after school playing on the computer. For example my cosiun is on the computer evryday doing  but wasting his time are you still with me. Secondly children should be studying on the computer not playing video games and going in website that are not allowed more then @NUM1 do students and children are on the internet palying video games and doing something the is done everyday also I have seen many kids playing games on the computer. Thirdly student will never learn nothing if they wast there time because computer is for studing and many students don't have there time wisely as they should also many student should be useing comput only sometimes not everyday I have notice that so many students don't learn from compu for because they are not studing tests mre then @PERCENT1 stundent fail classes because of computer. First of people should be spending time with  and friends because they are teh most important people aroun ud not computers. Are still with me? Secondly friends are the most important people I ever had because they care about and love you like you're ther families but what if you just wast youre on computer how are you know all your friends. For example m allways on comput never goes to see her friemds amd her friends to to here because she never cares about their only computer do god get what im saying here. Thirdly family is also important then just being on the computer because they care about you have to at lease spend sometime with family for example many families stop spending time with each othe because computer is important to them. Lastly help you're community is goal because you make you\re city look you don't want it he be massy also many people quit help with commicity servic around the neighbor for example I have see  trash on grounds and because they dont care. Finally going out doing sports and starting fit is very important. First of playing sports is far and youve health but people never play sports anymore just because computer for example @NUM2 people stop playing sports, secondly going to is very import because is good.	4	4	8
423	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people in our community use computers for positive ideas. Such as if gives you hadn and eye coordination, gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family. This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people. To begin with computers give a positive efect on people because it gives you hand and eye cordination. For example that can help you to have ability to do more. Like work somewhere such as a restraunt. This needs lots of cordination for holding heavy trays. My mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of cordination she tells me. Another reason would be you would have more hand cordination driving because you can react fast. Some people say that computers make you not be able to see while. Which than you would need glasses. But thats there desision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today. Secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places. Why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there. Another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries. Computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad, which also they arn't getting exersize if all there doing is researching when they can do that in the own town. But about @PERCENT1 of kids can stil be on the computer than go and get exersize. This is another reason computers are an impact. Lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker. For exmaple if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a @NUM1 minute send. Its quicker and easier. Another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well. About @PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to there friends But some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad. But to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its there friend. This is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults, and children, parents. To conclude, I would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and beable to talk to friends. Others disagree because it can ruin your eyes, not get exersize and lastly give your child unsafe. But that can be changed easily by limiting kids, see who they talk to and get them in a sport. This is why I think computers are a postive impact.	4	5	9
427	1	"To: The @ORGANIZATION1 can be a big part mof people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth grade teachers once said, ""@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big french paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!"" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers! "	6	5	11
452	1	Should there be computers in are society. Yes, there should computer are good things and are good help. I can give you @NUM1 good reasons why. Paying bills, facebook, and research. This is why computers are good. My first reason why computers are good is because people need to pay bills its easier to pay your bills online then to do all the paper work, and it makes it faster for people and computers are really good for them thats why we need computers. My second reason why we need computers is because people have facebook. And thats a good way to talk to friends, and get new friends and its fun to have facebook and just interact with people and why computers are good in society. My thrid reason why we should have computers in are society is because research and need to get info from and an computer is really good help for that, there great help for research like an specific topic the computer has all that. In conclusion having computers is really good because of paying your bills, facebook, and research, so people need computers so I told you all good things about computers can you tell me yours!!	4	3	7
465	1	Computers, computers, computers. Who doesn't own them right? They teach hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure bull !@. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step. Cellphones, cars, telephones want! There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em? By the press of the button, all doors unlocked, by a swith the windows go down, yes, by computer. Now, how do computer's make life easier you say? Well keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats the pencils you we are all made by, the yoou know what! Machines, but programed with computer chips. Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With there everday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact. We use them everday, and hopefully they'll be around for the longest.	4	4	8
474	1	Do you like going on the computer? Well after you read this I don't thing you would want to. I know that the population of @ORGANIZATION1 uses the computer. If your on the computer for @NUM1 hr. yo can damiges your eye and you would have to were glass and you don't want that soemtimes it's hart to stay off of them. The internet can be for alot for things like to talk to your friends and family. And to play games. the computer is for to about diferent things one thing you can learn is the presidents other thing is your family history. Now you know what the computer can do to you. Only use computer or @NUM2 or @NUM3 mins. That is what I would do.	3	3	6
479	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are benefitial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc.Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends/family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exersise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits. In this day/age, the computer is something we can't live without.	5	5	10
498	1	"To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5's possible, imagine a world @CAPS7 computers, @CAPS1 drivers are bumping around and having difficulty watching the wheel and the road, phone bills are throughh the roof because of the whole world having no other way of communicating, and students are home worried sick that they don't have a book to study with. Computers affect all of these areas of our lives. They teach hand-eye coordination, allows us to communicate with others dozens of ways, and let students learn and stay up-dated from their very own home. Computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. To begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand-eye coordination. In a recent report the @ORGANIZATION2 states that in the past five years; the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. The video games, the computer mice, and even typing the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, finger and other apend ages, ""@CAPS5's not only on the road where hand-eye counts."" says @PERSON1, head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital. ""@CAPS6 finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can form robotics surgery with much more presision than our older atendings."" @CAPS7 the coordination we aquire from the computer many jobs @MONTH1 be out of reach, too. When saked, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 managers of local business said they would have someone who could type, over someone who couldn't. So, though you @MONTH1 think computers teach no they can coordination for the rest of a persons life. Secondly, computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others world. In a @DATE1 poll, only @PERCENT1 of @NUM3 years old had, but a recent poll says that @PERCENT2 now have e-pals. Computer have opened to communicate e-mail, @CAPS8, social networking sites, just to name a few! Parenting @CAPS9 says that parents prefer there teens to e-mail trends or @CAPS8 as aposed to talk on the phone because @CAPS5 quiets the house, the phonelines for others and keeps phone bill low. My friend once only talked online for a month and her parents encourage her because the phone decreased by a third, @CAPS5's clear that even though you @MONTH1 feel that computers take up time that could be spent with others, @CAPS5's actually a way to communicate with people everywhere. Finaly, computers can help students learn. In todays schools, students depend on homework being posted online, and getting their books over the web. Once, my brother didn't take home his book-bag for a week, and got all online. We was greatful for the strain off his back. When asked @PERCENT3 of @NUM4 graders say they use e-books at least twice a week. the internet also is a valuable research tool. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 highschoolers say they use a book for researh less than once a month. As you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. In conclusion, computers help as with coordination, communication and education. Computers have nothing but positive effects on people on society as a whole."	6	6	12
511	1	Dear Newspaper, I think a computer is not something bad for you. A computer can help you do many things @CAPS1 could help you learn, chat with friends, and @CAPS1 can entertain you. A computer can get you sucessful in life @CAPS1 helps you learn a lot of things such as computer engineering. Computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers. @CAPS1 is very challenging at first, but when you look @CAPS1 up on search websites you'll find all your answers. Chatting is the number one thing kids, adults , and teenagers do. @CAPS1 is good and bad in a way, @CAPS1 is good because because your phone bill wont be that high up so you save minutes. @CAPS1 is bad because @CAPS1 can also ruin your eyes just remeber dont get to close to the screen. The computer is all about fun, you have millions of websites you can go on. To have fun for example @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com those are the three main ones I go on they are so fun. They have tons of games for kids and for adults too. I Have proven my point that computers are not bad for you because they can help you learn, they lower your phone bill, and its also very fun. Yes I know they might take exercise time away, or hurt your eyes but who cares just make up a time limit so you have time to exercise. Do not get to close to the screen because @CAPS1 can hurt your eyes.	4	4	8
544	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people, are that computers are used for the wrong reasons. Teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family. But instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it. Therefore, the computer and the concept of surfing the web is bad because it consumes childrens much and because educationally computers can give the wrong information. Until the late @DATE1's, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist in @CAPS1 opinion, this would have been better. For example. children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays. At this age middle schoolers and high-schoolers should be focused on their grades and their . But instead, they get too addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 that they forget about their school work and their priorities, and their grades start to slip. Even sudlts have this problem. For instance, buisness people, accountants and assistants will consistently be checking their emails. Also, people who work at a desk or in a cudical all day are almost always on the computer. In other words, I believe that jobs should cut dwn on how many workers they have on a computer, and family homes should cut down on the amount of time each member spends online. Another reason I think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information. For example, people could insect their own perspective of an idea on websites such as wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. If a student was doing a project or just homework and decided to surf the web for some @ORGANIZATION2 or information they dont know if their information is correct. I believe this means that the internet and the web don't beat books or history. In conclusion, computers have a bad effect on people for the reasons of it consumes children and teen's minds, people use the internet too much and because educationally computers can sometimes give false information.	4	4	8

548	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers are not something to be afraid of. They help many people in different ways, like the @CAPS1, teachers, students, scientists, and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life. Hasn't a computer already helped you today? Because of that, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. Who has said that by using computers you dont interact with your family as much? Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e-mail. With e-mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, dont bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just ""happen"" to get lost, try going on @ORGANIZATION1 maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than creating a simple map, it can give you precious information! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids. The kids can look up @LOCATION1 and in @NUM1 seconds they have all the information they need! In most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper. What is also nice is that you dont need to go through huge books for one small piece of information. It is much easier, looking it up on the computer. Speaking of not using big books for imformation computers don't use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow! Millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future. people have already created touch-screen computers and computers will grow even more! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing, but look at the facts! Doesnt the newspaper write the newspaper on computers? If they didnt, they would be having hand cramps all the time! And what about docters dont they have your medical history on the computer, if not all these papers would get lost! Like in the beginning, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future."	4	4	8
576	1	"Dear Newspaper, I believe comuputer have made a great effect on people in society. I believe this because they make you smarter, they help with entertainment needs, they also give you the option to socialize with websites, and online chatting. theese are things people need in every da life and heres now. One reason why I believe computers benefitt people in society, is with the simple fact that computers teach you things. I mean sure you can pick up a book, but why? with a computer you can quickly, and easily type in what you need to know and within seconeds you have @NUM1 million sites that can tell you what you need to know. Computers can also show you places that you've always wanted to see and learn about, the computer can tell you an exact location and information about the area. I know your thinking to yourself. ""wow how cool!!"" but that nothing wait untill you hear what else i have to say! Computers can give you instructions on how to build stuff, step by step instruction to create a work of art. My seconed reason is computers can give you entertainment like playing games, watching movies, and tv shows you missed because you were at work or doing something important. My last reason why computers benefit society is with entertainment, you can make friends or chat with the ones you have, with websites like facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, ect. Making friends or keeping up with the ones you have in a positive way help fight depression. If your always happy on the computer. Therefore you'll have nothing to be depressed about. Also if you have any questions at all that you have wondering in your @CAPS3 ask the computer and it will awnser your questions throughly, and leave you satisfied with an awnser. As you can see computers can do many great things, and what I said is only a few things computers are capible of just watch, computers will be apart of our lives more and more and if you can't use one you @MONTH1 have a hard time. please if you have a different opinion consider my decisons. Thank you for your time."	4	4	8
580	1	"What if you're family all and to talk to them percent of people commucate online, and thats not a bad thing. Heres the thing, are you for or against kids/parents online for too long. I am all for this. Reasons being are lots of kids have friends that they talk to online, secondly kids have homework/projects that they might have to look up online, and my last reason for this is, some family might have @CAPS1 ect, so they can communicate online. My first reason for this is, a lot of kids have friends online that can't text or even talk on the phone, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now. ""I think the internet is a great things, I mean I would rather have my kids online than outside roaring the and getting into troupe."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1. @NUM1 of @NUM2 kids are online communicating with others. Without a doubt, kids bring home projects and homework everyday right? Wouldn't you rather your kid looking up information online, then have them guessing and getting it wrong? I know that alot of children don't have computers, internet or essy, or maybe their got allowed online. That's why they. I remember the times when I had a project due at school, and I guessed on. that didn't do my grade any good. So then I decided the next time I have a project to do it on the internet. And it worked, I got a much better grade then I did on the one I guessed on. Lastly, mostly everybody has on the internet and would live to and with them while. So even stay online too often your not on it for a bad reason, your on to talk to your family."" @CAPS3 I got internet in my house, I barly ever got to talk to my family. But just then, my son me to get one, and I have the chance to talk to my family everyday. @CAPS2 a recent of a computer. Some people do say on the computer for too long at times, and don't get out on exercise the amount a humane should. or they don't get out of the house as much as they used to @CAPS3 they got the internet. Yes but, it's a good cause, it's not like because forever. Also it's being used for good. Not for anything bad. I think the internet is a great thing, and it puts a effect on many people. Reasons are, kids have friends online to talk too, ""lots of that needs internet, and last of people have family online to talk to so it's now or get out there and your best pick. The issue grapple with is if you for or against internet acess! So get out there, and change now."	4	4	8
586	1	Dear newspaper editor, In my opion computers have a positive effect on people. The @CAPS1 allows people to communicat. People can learn bout things, places, even their own family. I also think that with a appropiate dosage it could help your body. If the @CAPS1 was never invented how would you talk to people from around the world. Mr. editor what if you were fourteen and had no friends. Well you could always go on myspace.com, facebook.com, or any other online community and make friends. Another thing that could happen is a family member or friend goes to another country for a vacaition and can't have long distance calls, you can talk to them on @CAPS2 or something like that. If your not really into using the @CAPS1 for communication you could learn. With the @CAPS1 you could learn a lot. You can even go to school online, but as I was saying you can learn about anything. One time when I had a project at school on fredrick douglas I used the @CAPS1 for help. I learned bout his family, his childhood, were he's from, and lots of other important facts. The @CAPS1 can be a good search enging but don't stay for to long your body needs you too. I think think the @CAPS1 better can your health. People always say if stay on the computer you get fat and unhealthy, but I don't think that. First being on a computer using the mouse is helping your hand-eye coordination. you can also look at diet plans, find medicine for your health, or find new ways to exercise your body. So thats why I think the @CAPS1 can help your body. All of these reason is why I think the @CAPS1 has good effects on people.	4	4	8
604	1	"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 are many reasons why the computer technoligy benefits the society. For starters, the newspaper companies use computers to write the @ORGANIZATION2 paper. Personally, I believe that computers benefit the society for many reasons. Computers help with education, career building, and helps people connect with family. By readin this letter, I hope that this make computers appealing to you. One reason why people benefit from computers is how they help with education. In a poll taken at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the students say that computers hel htem with their academic career. Also, many adults use computers for an education too. In the student body in class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year. @PERCENT2 of those students finished their high school and college years through online classes. Another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers. At @CAPS3 industries, @PERSON1, the @CAPS4, says,  I dont know where our business would be if we didn't use computers. "" @CAPS5 to a poll taken by @CAPS4's of many high ranning industries, @PERCENT3 said that their business revolves around the internet. this could very well be the poll your @CAPS4 took. Finally, computers help families that are seperated, connect with each other. A marine said that he tries to contact his family as much as he can while he is at sea. If anyone deserves to contact their family that they haven't seen in two years, it should deffinately be the people in the army. In conclusion, the computer technoligy has benefited many people. A system that could regulate peoples computer use could be implamented but it would not make anybody happy. The changes could be made but, if anyone tried to take something important away, would you not do anything to stop it?"""	5	4	9
633	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a good effect on people in our comunnite, from computers you can learn, talk to people from out of state or even out of the county, also you can learn hand eye cornation. Computer can help you earn in many ways one way you could learn from computers is students can go online and got information for their school projects by finding this information it can help the students get better grades. Also the students can use the computer as a way to study. There are educational games on the computer that kids play and without knowing this they are learning and studying for school. Another way you could too a is from online classes. This could help people also because do not have enough many to pay to go to classes. As you can see there are many ways to learn from having computer. The computer can also help you talk to people from out of the state or country. This could help famlies stay connected when they live so far away from you. My cousin @PERSON4 and my aunt @CAPS1 math live in @LOCATION1 and i hadn't met then until the @DATE1, when they came down. @CAPS3 that i have met them i am able to stay them through the computer. Dr. @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS2 close with familys and friends not only important for you you health."" by haveng computers we could talk to our relative and help our health. When you get out of college people let go of some good friends because they could live in different state,. the computers can help you stay connected with them. Lastly, computers can help you with you hand eye coodination, when your hand eye cornation because you are trying to type a word. and by hitting the key you want you are learning this. I have sam kids with special needs useing the computer is help them learn hand eye cornation. there is a girl in my school named @PERSON3 and the help her by leting her play games on the computer when in my class ive had to help her with picking things up, @CAPS3 to eat and walk with her hands alone. Her helper teacher. Ms @PERSON1 says the computer game has helped her. The effect that compuers have on society is good."	4	4	8
638	1	Dear @CAPS1 times, I am writing in regards to the article recently writen in your newspaper on computors. I believe that they are a vital part of the world today because; you can find information for protect or article in far less time then searching through books, you can get important news updates and entertainment is only a click away. My first reason was at the information on the internet. Say you were writing a paper on acient egyptians, and you need to know how to spell hiroglipics in a dictionary that would take a few minutes, online it would take about @NUM1 seconds. Or if you wanted to know when @ORGANIZATION1 died. It would take hours scouring textbooks untill you finally found it. on time it might take your just over a minute. The second reason I like computors is for news updates. You can figure out what happened in recent natural disasters, or how your stock is doing. Also computers helped us in the recent election, and will continue do so for a long time. The weather can always be found on time web for any in the world. This is a bad thing if you're planning a trip somewhere, wich you can also do with a computor. My third and final reason is that its hard to get bored on a computor. Every where on the web are cool gamesor funny videos. On the web there are about @NUM2 gaming sites and @NUM3 sites with funny/weird/cool videos and pictures. Many other places like facebook let you share picures with your friends, family, and relatives. Or you can chat with complete strangers from around the world. So next time you need information, news, or you are just bored go on your computor, and have fun.	4	4	8
650	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where no information could be saved for the whole world to observe a place with no communication with loved ones or friends; or a life with no possible way of learning of catastrophe's on the other end of the earth. Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education, and stay in contact with friends and family I'm sure our world greatly benifits from this mericle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what thier astronauts saw. But computers made the expirience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered recieving some of the first footage of he moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video are released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1 states @PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We make our students come involved in technology. These are the people who progress to make the best medicine cars and computers. Our students all are benificial to our world today."" @CAPS6 settle for anything less for our childrens' education? In the middle of trajedy; faced with a difficult decision; or even just lonely, longing for someone to count on; who do you turn go first? Your loved ones they are always there for you when you need them. Now because of our access to computers whether accross the world or just the other end of the block. We will always be in contact with the ones we love. @PERSON2, my friend, found out her aunt diagnosed last year with cancer. However, she was in a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing and @CAPS7. She could even contact her doctors to see her condition after. Her aunt conquered cancer with her neice and is living happily. With only a @NUM1 chance of living, @PERSON2 gave her the support she needed through most difficult @CAPS2. Not only did see the positive effects of staying in contact. Marcos a family therapist says @NUM2 of happy families stay in contact after seperating through internet."" @CAPS8 could anyone, ever leave those who you care most about behind? @CAPS3 a world with a full education, for our children to take advantage of and a place where we can stay with each other all the time. Thats the world we we live in."	5	5	10
653	1	@ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if wasn't @CAPS4 the computers we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other contries like we do now. Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.	4	4	8
657	1	The use of computers is great for everyone. Using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world. Also you can have the ability to talk to people. With a computer you can also learn about places all over the @LOCATION1 and the world. With a computer everyone can learn about people all over. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere in @LOCATION2 you could learn about what those people do. Also you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1 the computer would help a lot. You can search what thet wear and what holdays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends to. if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it. While using a computer you can also talk to people. With the use of @CAPS1 or A.I.M you can talk to your friends easily. You can ask them what homework you had if you weren't in dschool. You can also become better well friends with people you didn't know that wll, by saying hello, or how was your day. You can also email. If you meet someone you made friends with on vacation you can email them. You can also go to websites where you can talk to people in other countris. If you have a webcamyou can even video chat, and ask them questions about their country, or what they like. Also you can videochat with all yor friends to. Using a computer you can learn about places arounf the world. If you were going to a place ypu didn't know, you could look up the amazing resraurants, you could also look up fun things to do with the family. If you needed to do a projecct you can look up what the weather is like, and what the people do. if you wanted to help out a country that just had an earthquake or hurricane you could look up what you could do to help that country. Those three reasons are why compujters are essential to people. You can learn about different people, talk to your friends, and you can search and learn about different places arounf the world.	5	4	9
688	1	Dear newspaper editor, With all due respect to anyone that thinks the computer doesn't benefit society, I strongly disagree. Yes, there are many people that neglect other activities to be on the comuter, and yes, the computer is an invention that a lot of people depend on, but the computer is also an invention that we can benefit from in many positive ways. For example, @CAPS1' @PERSON1, a hip-hop artist with millions of fans, wasn't able to finish high school or go to colledge because of his career. He decided to get a colledge degree, so he started to attend a colledge. He had difficulty being in colledge, however, because he was constantly being harrassed by his fans, so he started going to colledge online. That way, he was able to focus on his studies and get his degree without the harrassment. The computer also has websites on the internet that are used in schools. They help teach students in a way that they will have fun and enjoy what they're doing, giving them a better learning experience. Aside from the positive uses of the internet, the computer also contains progams that can benefit us just as well. Microsoft @CAPS2, for example is a program on the computer that is used to create @CAPS2 documents such as peoms, essays, song lyric, and even letters. You can print out these @CAPS2 documents to have a copy of your ownn to keep and show people wherever you go, but if your not finished, it can be saved on your computer. People use the computer for many things, books, movies and so one. Over the years that its been existance, its benefited us al lot. What do you think?	4	5	9
698	1	Dear who it @MONTH1 concern, I think that computers are very affective but then again they are not because would you rather have your kids on the computer or lets say some children smoke and some hang out in the streets to much yeah it does do a lot affect to them. In my predictionI say computers are very addictive but then again it really isn't because there are some people who really don't like being on the computers for a long time cause it gets boring and it starts to hurt you eyes. I will understand if they don't want to get off when it passes there bed time. Some kids do a lot of bad things out in the street and hang out in the streets a lot, but when they go on the computer it can stop some of them from doing those things. A lot of kids have myspace and facebook ... and more and it is the best way to stay in contact with your family and friends thats one of the main reasons kids go on and there is other electronic devices that stops kid from exersicing and stuff like that such as a psp go or xbox @NUM1 or ds, dsi playstation @NUM2 and @NUM3. So I think it is an addiction and it affects kids but the things you'd rather have your kids do keeps them away from doing it.	3	3	6
701	1	@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online for the games make it even more fun thus it make them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true.	4	4	8
705	1	What is more fun, stairing at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beutifull nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family? And always remember what the is.	4	4	8
715	1	Dear local newspaper I support the advances in technology. I am going to tell @NUM1 thinks way. One is on a rainy day. I dont think you are going to go out an play in the rain so you could go on the computer and play games. Talk to friends. Or you could use the computer for school work or for work. Say that you have to look something up for school and you can't get to the liebery, but you have a computer at your house. You can use it to find info. You can use the computer to learn how to do something like making somthing and a lot more. You can use the computer after school if you cann't go out and hang with your friends. You can do something with them online. Last things you can ask your friends if there is homework so you don't miss it. So that is why I support advanes in technology.	4	4	8
718	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes gluded to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have childre. Adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutley nothing! We are so fortonate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. ANd even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running program held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly hapy but if we on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contatct. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusment park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our barkyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instaed of entertaining ourselves on computer we could be taking hikes, walks on the beach even our street or playing outside in our yard. On a computer you can see a magestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is so beautiful, why ever it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a lot of thier day on it. We could be improving obesity, spending more time with family and friends, and exploring Nature! lets make a shange so we can do all of these things!	5	5	10
742	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not bad for society. They actually can be quite good for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in @CAPS7. @CAPS5 people use a @CAPS2, <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of the time @CAPS7 is to talk with people on the @CAPS3, whether @CAPS7 is using video chat or e-mail. People who don't like to use @CAPS2 and e-mail @CAPS10 ""@CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person."" With e-mail, you can send a message to some one miles away. If you are sending someone a list, a recipe for example. you don't want to @CAPS10 to them over the phone. @CAPS7 would be easier to type @CAPS7 out and then send @CAPS7 to them over the e-mail. ""@CAPS5 my son said. he was going to tech me how to use e-mail, I thought @CAPS7 was going to be a waste of time,"" @CAPS6 @PERSON1, senior citizen. ""@CAPS7 tursns out, @CAPS7 wasn't. Now i use e-mail e-mail every day. Many people think email is a waste of time, but @CAPS7 can help you in your everyday life. The @CAPS3 can helps in @MONTH1 ways also. @CAPS7 can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir fry but you don't know what to put in @CAPS7. You try to call you mother but she isn't there. Your next choise is to look look @CAPS7 up on the @CAPS2. @CAPS7 turns out theres a website that gives a recipe for a stir fry and you follow a do make the best one even. I know for an experience that you can find maps to places on line, since i have to go some is here almost everyweek. Google map is the most used place on the @CAPS3, besides e-mail. Some newspaper have websites @CAPS11 you can read the paper without actually paying for the paper This saves you money and @CAPS7 was less paper @CAPS11 we can save trees. The huge world of the @CAPS3 can change our lives. @PERCENT1 of people that use the @CAPS2 almost everyday are students. Students use the @CAPS2 for many reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e-mail. ""I have messy handwriting"", @CAPS10 student, @PERSON2. ""@CAPS11 if if weren't for the @CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me"" @PERSON2 is the one of many people who are lucking that they harmy typing on the @CAPS2. Another reason students use @CAPS2 is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that he/she used the @CAPS3 @PERCENT2 of the time. There @MONTH1 not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the @CAPS3 will have many website and blogs for him/her to use. The third reason is for help. There are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject. The @CAPS3 can help a student pass school. A @CAPS2 can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good."	5	5	10
747	1	Dear newpapers journalist, People shouldn't have computers. Computers have a negative effect on most people. The @LOCATION1 has The highest number of obese citizens in the world. A lot of people spend their day sitting in front of a computer and work. Then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride. Some people like to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet, even though there's a whole forest outside. Another problem with computers is how safe they are. There are a lot of people on computers that don't belong there, and are trying to hack onto your computer. Viruses can sneak into your computer without you knowing it, and can look up eveything on your computer, even personal information. They can even monitor what your typing, which could be passwords! A lot of people have been paying their taxes online and if there is a virus on their computer, they could get their person's personal information! Plus, most people who pay their taxes online have to use their online bank accounts, so now. They have your bank account password too! Computers are bad for most people. They make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus.	4	4	8
752	1	In my opinion I think that computers have nothing to do with people having lack of exercise or sleep. I think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want. The person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not. When people are on the computer I think they dont play as much and start to get fat but that its their decision. Also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise. However, they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising. Being on the computer @NUM1 people dont get the chance to interact with their family and friends because they want to be lazy and stay on the computer. The family and friends get angry and dont want to hang out anymore and within a couple of months they have no friends. Nature is good smells good, looks good, and computers make people stay inside all day! I think we should have more time outside. Also computers sometimes make kids want to not clean their room, not do chores because they are addictid to the computer.	3	4	7
753	1	Dear, local newspaper I agree with @CAPS1 that computers are not good because of different reasons such as putting a person's health in danger for not excersicing much or making people spend more time on a computer than interact with family & friends and sadly also it causes people to change there attitudes and ways of being. But if you wanna hear more than you will just have to read on. There are plenty consequences that people have for spending too much time on the computer, such as people getting addicted to watching certain things or addicted to watching certain things or simply get addicted to the computer itself. Plenty of people now a days, have to wear glasses and probably most of them have to wear them because of too much computer, and it must be really bad having to wear glasses the rest of your life. Also too much computer is bad for a person's health because they're giving more time to a computer than spending that time excercising. I believe people should spend more time interacting with family & friends because it can also make you lose your friends and/or family because your not giving them the time they need & friends and family are one of the most important things in a person's life. And last but not least. too much computer can change a person such as changing their manners, the way they speak, and there attitides. Well I've giving you reasons why I think computers are not good such as, putting health in danger, changing a person's life, and causin them to lose family & friends now is up to you the rest.	4	4	8
756	1	Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to let you know that many people are spending to much time on computors rather than enjoying nature. People say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying. Many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us. Im going to saying that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Im thinking that in some points many family members and friends see then other relative person on companion so much on the computers it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can effect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision.) @CAPS1 more and more people should lay off it. @PERSON1 of yale university has conducted extensive reaserch and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damage of using it every time. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on something to let them later on have the spaare time to enjoy and have fun with nature but something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves. Whatsoever im hoping from you to agree with my position so this can be possible to break this habit of going on computers and having no time for your family and friends is not such a to start off with.	4	4	8
764	1	Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @CAPS2 one week can @CAPS5 your vision from a @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you keep it up now it @MONTH1 not seem bad but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer.	5	4	9
780	1	More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.	5	4	9
787	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, spending too much time online has negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full social experience when they talk on email, facebook and twitter. Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas, such as family, friends and school. They aren't being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise. Though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels. In person interaction is better than online, because you see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is benificial to you and your friend. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for you close family, you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing. Your relationship with you family could be in jeoporady because you insist on using your computer. When you use the computer, you're probably eating some food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off. The obesity level in @LOCATION1 is increasing, probable cause being over-usage of computers. being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers we aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our @ORGANIZATION1 has to offer, online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social, health, and taking up too much of our lives. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites are being used to interact. Why not just call or meet up with person, instead of using the computers?	4	4	8
793	1	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Now as technology keeps advancing there are many educational options online, you can now interact with people without physically being with them and you can play games that will enrich your lives. Firstly, I believe that computers offer a wide variety of educational options. On the internet alone you can view your school textbook. You can also have extra practice with the many resources that come with the online textbook. Without physically bringing your textbook home you can view the book online. There are tons of extra practice, and practice quizes in the online textbook that are perfect for studying. Also, when you see on the internet you can get real time updates of major events in the world. For example, the other day I logged onto the internet and saw an article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1. I saw nothing of this in the newspaper, but the internet was so up to date that you can stay informed about something that happened only a few minutes ago. But if you choose not to utilize the internet, there are many programs that are very helpful for learning. That are direclly cetered to developing your children's math and reading skills. These programs can give anyone a jumpstart in education. Another opportunity that could be helpful on a computer is the ability to interact with other people. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 sites are very good ways to interact with people. When you video chat you can have a conversation with some on class on video! Even most they are not physically with you talk to. Instan messaging is a less direct, but still useful who talk to someone far away. You can share the news or just have a conversation with anyone you know. Lastly, social @CAPS3 sites such as facebook, and twitter are a valuable way to communicate with people. You can past messages, play games or simply talk to someone on these websites. They certainly take the best parts of online interaction and put them together. Finally, there are many online games that are very useful. If you ever wanted to go bowling but you never had the time you could play a game online. Or if you have ever wanted to drive a stock car you could play a game online. These online games are good ways to sire you the opportunity to do something you wont normally do. Also many games help sharpen your reflexes and your quick thinking skills. These could possibly cary over into the situations where you need good reflexes and quick thinking. Games could possibly be very useful when you need to prepare yourself something. Also online games are for and enjoying also. Overall I believe the computer is a valuable resource in advertion, interacting with other people and playing useful games. After all who could pass up the opportunity to better prepare yourself for life?	5	6	11
795	1	To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great effect on people. Computers are useful for homework, it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family, you can also look up direction and information to a place. Computers are good for last minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial. While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work; there's no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school you can go to the school's website and find out the homework. Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to? If so wouldn't you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all! Some examples are aim, emails, and other networks and they don't cast money at all its free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well if there's a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers. Not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. It can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students averages easier and faster and children can do their homework efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall computers are useful.	4	4	8
796	1	Isn't it great getting a refreshing when your outside? Wouldn't you experiences the rush of jumping into the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 instead of sitting inside, gazing at pictures of the @LOCATION1? You might think that computers are helping society today, but you are wrong. The human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more. Computers are helping society become more and more lazy. We can get just as much information out of books if we try our best. Hand-eye coordination is important, and we can get it though activities, such as football, and tennis. We can also get it from activities! Drawing, reading, and even playing an instrument can all improve hand-eye coordination while letting you explore your creative side. Some people believe that computers teach hand-eye coordination, and it can but there are better ways to get it. It would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity. Many people like to travel in all different places of the world, but going to a foreign area with no knowledge don't smart at all. So what do you do? Go the most convinient source, internet. But what if I told you that any person could put anything on the internet? You could be getting info on @LOCATION3 when you think you're getting info on @LOCATION2. The most reliable source would be from a book. Reading is very powerful, especially if you're reading from a good source. Kids lately have been making lives on the internet. The only way they communicate is through online chat. Chatting online can/should never replace time in person with friends. Relationships with others online is never real. We're using our knowledge of how to communicate with others. The internet isn't worth it. So as you can see computers are no good. Thank you.	4	4	8
800	1	Dear Newspaper, People use computers in their everyday lifes, & having computers has become customary to many people throughout the @LOCATION1. We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment, in all these ways computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, & connections with people from just about anywhere, but some of us become too attached with this virtual life instead of living our own real lifes. This happens to many people, some don't even notice what computers are doing to them. For most people, life @MONTH1 be challenging & the real world to stressing, so they retire to the computer for awhile, & to me this is fine, but when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer, this would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think, they need excerise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game, & sure, in some ways, it is. But it could reach its full potential by doing something else thats not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a destruction. This @MONTH1 happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Now a days people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't neccessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets so what I'm saying is that a talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends & have real people come first. Like I said in the beginning computers are part of our everyday life, and its not a bad thing, they can be very helpful. But you must control what you do on them and how much you use them. If you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle. Making you, your friends, & family a whole lot happier.	5	5	10
826	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health."	5	5	10
846	1	Dear local newspaper, I have heard about this issue concerning people are on their computer to much. In my opinion, i think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons. There are the reasons to why I think that people should less time on the internet, and more outdoors. One reason to why I think that people should spend less time on the computer and more times outdoors is so that they can get more exercise. When you get exercise you can lose weight. You can also feel lighter and better about yourself, you will be more active. Another reason to why you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer is because if you don't you will get very very very lazy. If you don't get out and play or exercise, you will become tired. Also, you will become cranky and want do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so into your computer screen. My last but not least reason to why we should spend more time outdoors than indoors on the computer is because we can miss out on family fun that goes on. Since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events. They @MONTH1 also miss out on family dinners and movie night. If you do not want to miss out on the fun, I suggest that you get cuclasses more and stop being a lazy couch potato. As you cansee, there are many reasons to why we should spend more time outdoors doing activities such as going on a bike side, going kout to eat, as even a nice stroll along the heart while walking the dog. I really hope that my opinions means something to you. And I also hope you agree with me. Thank you for your time.	4	4	8
848	1	Computers are very helpful in many of ways. I believe that computers can a very great needed affect on you. @CAPS5 can cause you to @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and cheap @CAPS3. The computer can @CAPS1 you in many interesting ways. The fast wat @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 is @CAPS4 helping other plan @CAPS4 vacations by money to them. Also @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 by know how to do diffrent things like @CAPS6 if you get lost or show you how to get there. The second way is helps is to give @CAPS2. The computer can give you plenty of @CAPS2. I use the computer @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS7 of . @CAPS5 also gives me @CAPS2 about a @CAPS8 college that I would @CAPS9 and like to attend to. The last way the computer helps out the its with box from there. If you @CAPS10 online you can in the computer. I @CAPS9 this machine because you don't have to buy something that just come out @CAPS4 the real expensive @CAPS12 you can just @CAPS10 online and @CAPS11 @CAPS5 @CAPS4 a cheaper @CAPS12. Also @CAPS13 mom wanter to @CAPS11 new @CAPS15 on the dealer but @CAPS5 was expensive so went online and bought @CAPS5 cheaPer than the would sell @CAPS5 to us. This is how the computer can come in handy when you need @CAPS5. This is why I believe that computer you.	3	3	6
858	1	@ORGANIZATION1, I believe that we should tell the people of @LOCATION1 about the dangers of using computers too much. For example people who use the computer constently spend less time doing anything else in general. Also the longer you stay on the more you use it, and this habit forms a addiction, which might be hard to break. Finally people who always play video games on computers begin to lose terms of reality. Computers are turning this nation into a bunch of mindless slothes. If you have children, what do you think they do most of their lives. Maybe their going outside and getting exercise, or their brains could be getting sucked into a computer screen. Most kids by the age of @NUM1 have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hour. This shows that kids spend more time using the computer then anything else. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3 and eventually he was so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you don't want your kids to be like @CAPS1, tell them to get up and go play outside. You probably think that using your computer everyday couldn't form an addiction, but computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientest have found that using the computer everyday for one hour can be enough to form a addiction. In fact if we could scan people to find addiction @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This means that @NUM4 years from now the world addiction to computers could be at @PERCENT2 or greater. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone uses their computers @NUM3, I don't. Video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest. If you have a computer you will have video games. Small dosages can be fine, but non-stop playing can lead to serious problems. Because of the fantesy content people might start to lose sight of reality. For example, scientest tested a video game on kids, and now @PERCENT1 believe in zombies. Now they cannot ever play the game for it might cause serious brain damage. Just to make sure you get my point, let us recap. More computer means lack of exercise and social interaction, you can easily be addicted, and you can lose your sense of realness. I that you don't want to see you or your kids brillant brains turned to mush by computers.	5	4	9
860	1	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat thier friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer.	4	4	8
863	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those @PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room. Get outside go for a road trip save life humanity your fellow niebor your family.	4	6	10
895	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I believe that computers benefit society. Computers are a wonderful household object to have that make life easier in many ways. Computers allow the everyday family to see new places, through photos online, and people, through the internet. Computers also provide a social networking throught a community, state, or even a country! Lastly, a computer is another resort to go to when trying to accomplish something, because there is always something on the internet that will help you. There's a famous quote that goes, ""the largest room in the world, is the room for improvement."" In my opinion, the computers could make that room a little smaller. While experts say that computers are making people spend too much time indoors, and not too much time seeing the wonders of nature outside, the computer can prove them wrong. The internet is a wide ocean of pictures, wordes, and sounds. The computer is the item that organizes it, for your entertainment. There is a picture of just about anything imaginaeable on the internet; from the palm shaped islands of @LOCATION1, to the frozen @CAPS1 tundra in the @LOCATION3. You are able to see penguins in the southern ice cap and the ricefields of @LOCATION2 a bird's eye view all by simply moving your fingers. It's also possible not just to see places but to see people from how for the distance is! Today, people are sending pictures to and from each other via emails. People are actually sharing their memories with each other, all thanks for the computer. I hope what I have just explained now helps me make my. Computers are only here to make our lives. Imagine talking to your friends, not having an with his ever leaving your room. This would or even an impossibility fifty or seventy @DATE1, but this is People's social relationship have greatly progressed the half and it only goes has allowed people to their up on the their up on the their with their family and friends. I'll always a positive thing, using this right way. Having your house to tell, individually, your friend about your time to disney world is such a hastle. If you just put the pictures on a social networking system, like facebook, or twitter, memories will be stored through, litterally, the clicks of aborton. Memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer. Planing a vacation is a trough job to do, but what if that job could all take place in our sport? An entire vacation can be planned, confirmed and paid for thanks to the computer. Jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in @DATE1 minuets for less using the computer. This allows people more time to go have fun with their lives and not have to worry about plannings. Computers allow people to compress hours of work into a matter of minutes. Experts say that computers are taking away people's lives"" I would disagree, because; people are new places or people, social networking is more advanced, and time that could have been spent planning is now living."	6	4	10
899	1	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1't you love to go in your computer? @CAPS1't you get a lot done on them? Well I think they have a positive effect on people. I strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. These are my three reasons; you can chat online with friends and family, help people do research on projects, and help people get there jobs done in everyday life. So please, local newspaper keep reading and I will change your mind about computers effects on people. Do you have family or friends who @CAPS1't live around here that you want to keep in touch with? Using the computer for email or a chat site like facebook will do that. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2. The only way my family can keep in touch with them not spending money is email. My mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time. If you ask me I think that is a positive effect computers have. Have you ever researched anything using a computer? I knew I have! For a school project in @CAPS2 I had to research about @LOCATION1. I did all my research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have gotten that grade if I did not use the computer to do research. Do you use a computer in your job? Well even if you @CAPS1't I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work. He is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which means he managed portfolios. He has to use @ORGANIZATION1 to check on the stock chart. Another example is my mom, teacher, she has using the computer to email parents if the student need help or up. So as you can see computers have good effect on our society. These are my reasons : you can chat online with friends and family, helps people do research on projects, and helps people do research on projects, and helps people get there jobs done in everyday life. I hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Say yes to computers good effect!	4	4	8
927	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family.	3	4	7
930	1	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it will help you with interacting, learning and coordination. By interacting with people like far away friends or unknown frieds. If they are far its a nice way to send photos back and forth to see how the person/people are doing. Family is a very important factor in computers because if you havent seen the person you can tell how they are progressing in life. If thats not the case you can meet new people. By meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust. Learning! Learning is a good thing for adults an children. Computers can teach children by showing them new words, colors shapes and sizes. For an adult it can show them meanings of words or new words. Words, colors and sizes can all be round on a computer all by learning. A computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination. You can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type. Your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways. By sitting up straight in your computer chair all day can improve your posture. Your back can get straigher from all time you are sitting. Your mind can be foucused and in one pot fucusing on thing is good for you such as the computer screen. Now, people can think that computers are good for you too. But there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way.	4	4	8
938	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a child of the tech generation, or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning. That meaning is life. Our life revolves around technology in general as the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The chief technological preference, computers, is greatly beneficial, arent as bad as many people speculate, and help us live and prosper in this struggling world. Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a neucence but could never have used aho. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, lets be practical, how many normal people actually wake upwake up and point out the drearyness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously choes t o overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, bag things, and get the cutting-edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Further more, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? Thats funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companys and saves lives? You probably didnt even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the hubble space carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didnt choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didnt even say that seismologist use computers to traet the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didnt know. So, lets face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did them. In fact, pardon me. You probably didnt do the research in the first place, instead pointing fingers at the innocent. Smooth move, buddy.	6	5	11
956	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people that excersise and go on the computer mainly, I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise. Sure some people just chat and learn about that far away place they could go there and explore the buety and nature. I think computers are great effects on people, They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2 uncle that came from @LOCATION1 he learned how to speak english of the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are a lot. People have classes online they go to @CAPS3 mothers that are single that have kids for example, they get their diplomas and degrees of the computer online. And theirs other @CAPS3 @CAPS2 aunts and uncles they go to english classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. @CAPS3 i go on @PERSON1 all the time all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. @CAPS4's fun, but also educated. I think that all computer have positive effects on people. All of them should their should'nt be one computer with negative effects on people. But that's only by @CAPS2 opinion. Computers are @CAPS3 robots they do lots for us. We type reports, learn, read online. And then theres also were we play games online, and educated games. I believe that their are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example you could search up: mistery, animals, natures and places. You wouldn't beleive how many results the computer has. So who would have negative effects of the computer. All @CAPS4's trying to do is help us and out education @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2 spanish sometimes. So why would people think that computers arn't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tommorrow. Also I could see what the news are, and i could contact @CAPS2 teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people.	5	4	9
968	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless uphoria of information regarding his death. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!	5	4	9
982	1	"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?"	4	4	8
988	1	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers.	4	4	8
990	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe the computer does have positive perks, but it also has negative perks. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you then forget to excersize. Reason three, your health is in jeopardy. Firstly, you loose interaction with family and friends. Because you would spend so much time on the computers. It ruins your marriage if you are married. If you have kids you risk your relationship with them. I am not saying to stop using computers. Because I use them myself. I am saying don't make your life the computer. It's not good for you! Secondly, you need excersize. Stastics show @PERCENT1 of the people who live on their computers gain weight faster would know because as @NUM1 yr old I have gained a little weight because of computers. Most people when on the computer tend to eat more @CAPS1 are all well-known facts. That have been proven. Since, you can't walk with a computer in hand, you stop moving. Meaning you stop excersizing. You have to limit your time and then there is where I believe they (computers) benfit you. Lastly, your health is very much at stake. If you are at the computer for @NUM2 hours at a time your eye-site will pay. My eyes stink when I am on the computer for half an hour. Doesn't your head hurt when you are the computer for so long? Yes, the computer is fun and it gives you things to do, I am the first one to admit that But, it also hurts your heath. For being on the computer for so long you are at risk for carpal tunal syndrome. Which is very painful. Computers are so much fun and make life easier. But, they have disadvantages. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you stop excersizing. Reason three your health is at risk. If you limit time, everythig will be alright!	4	4	8
993	1	"Have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts are concerned that people are using too much time on the computers. I believe we should still use computers. Without a doubt using a computer helps us learn. The computer helps us learn about other places in the world. @PERCENT1 of people say they would love to look at beautiful places in the world. Computers also can teach you how to speak a language. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that ""taking spanish online helped im a lot on her class. Computers now offer online study groups that can help us get into a college. Many people would agree that using a computer helps us learn new things. Its a fact that you instead other people on computers. You meet new people when you are in the computer. Most people live meeting other people online. You also learn social on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say they learn social on the computer. People also can learn to have a personality because they in use. @PERSON2 says that ""because I got on the computer I didn't have the personality but I feel like a whole person. As you interact with people on the computers. Did you know that a computer teacher in life say if you need to use a computer in your will one already. @PERSON3 says that using a computer helped you type. Using a computer helped hand eye coordination. You type a lot of essays in college too os that can help you as well. So now you know that a computer helps you in the future. Without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways. So what are you waiting for go out and go your computer today!"	4	5	9
1008	1	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 is true that more and more people use computers, which in sure you're aware of, but is @CAPS3 really nessesary. I use my computer, I used to use @CAPS3 all the time, but then I got into sports like skateboarding and snow boarding so now i got away from @CAPS3. Yet, @CAPS4 are many many people that still use them and i believe that people should really try to stop going on as much because you could start to get big @PERSON1 fat, @CAPS4 are way better thing to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air. First is that @CAPS3 is possible for you to get big @PERSON1 fat, being fat is not a good thing @CAPS3 could actually be heart breaking because they can't help @CAPS3, and i feel really bad for them. I have a few friends that are over weight like @PERSON1, @PERSON1 is a very over weight kid, he was about @NUM1 lbs whe nhe was @NUM2, I have not seen him in like a year and we had some good @CAPS2, but I do feel really bad because he is very over weight and @CAPS3 is terrible, @PERSON1 does not even know how to ride a bike, nobody would teach him anyways because he doesn't have a father and his mother is over weight as well and as fat as his sister. see her anymore. So being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make @CAPS3 worse. Next is @CAPS4 are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day, messing around on the computer all day is like saying in just going to throw my life away. Instead of being on the computer you could be with friends whether @CAPS3 is shopping sports youre still moving and that is way better then being on the computer trust me. Go for a walk @PERSON1 some thing just try to get yourself dumb, but still fun, computer. I will @CAPS3's fun @CAPS4 are many many thing to do on the computer. Most importantly is that @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air, being outside is a definatly amazing thing to do, you could be walking, be on trampoline, @PERSON1 skateboarding anything is better then being on the computer, even just sitting @CAPS4 on a rock outside is good for your body cause you need to got fresh air in your system. Just do something that involves being outside @CAPS3 is so much fun. So all you computer lovers get off and have some fun being outside with friends @PERSON1 your family. I hope you all listen to me and take my advice so remember @CAPS3 is very possible to get fat, @CAPS4 are way better things to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air.	5	5	10
1037	1	Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION1, I am writting this letter to you @CAPS4 I think people are not getting enogh exercise @CAPS4 they spend so much time on the computer and they are going to websites here are some things that I want you to write about so people can and @MONTH1 be aware. My first reason I exercise why this @CAPS4 so many people spent so much time on the computer they don't get they don't walk. They sit and want message their frends @CAPS1 day. Not worrying that they are ganning @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 A on their heart @CAPS4 of the @CAPS2. @CAPS4 of this it can @CAPS5 to heath @CAPS6 things could you can't do @CAPS15. m @CAPS7 reason @CAPS8 @CAPS9 websites to moral kids @CAPS10 @CAPS11 things they Are not suppose see when kids have free @CAPS12 computer excise the thing wen let me @CAPS11 this can @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS14 sites, gunsites, @CAPS15 to a things can make something they @MONTH1 really hurt someone or maybe even themselves. Kids try to learn @CAPS15 people talk like @CAPS16 websites things that they are not able to and over they can see Are @NUM1 on @CAPS16 @CAPS18. My third reason chat sites Places to get some attension They will @ORGANIZATION1 things they are not suppose to the @NUM2 year oldd man here some things to write are doing and please monitor them as much as you can to prevent this.	4	4	8
1041	1	I think that people shouldnt use the computer's that much because it make's you want to be on it and on it day. Like yea you can play games on it and talk to people like other people you use of lec see I can understand that but the other people around you like that live's with you people that on the computer all day can spend time with there family and friends and to other places then going to look at them on the computer's I mean like to see other people that you see on the computer like chat or like webcam on the computer, you can maybe go see in a other state and go visited them. then being on the computer people that always on the computer should get out because there never going to do things is they are always on the computer, like when @CAPS1 on the computer @CAPS1 on it for a hour are so the I do things with family and friends, but not all the time that @CAPS1 on it, like i understand if you work on the computer at work and then finishing things at home for your work, but once in a you get to spend some time with family and friends, not @CAPS4 be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and @CAPS4 go on the computer and that how people get lazy the start getting fat because they @CAPS4 go on the it and maybe stop to eat and back on the computer, then when they get off of it they will eb all tierd and stuff not feeling like going anywere @CAPS4 to sleep or like if they had sometimes to do after they would be all lazy an not wanted to do anything at all, that why people should get out more and do thing withe there family and friends to have fun withe there like.	3	3	6
1043	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer in their home? Well who wouldnt! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, its quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like @CAPS3 and facebook you can talk to people you normally dont get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet you can use websites like google, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also if I had to research a topic for @CAPS1 history project then I would go onto the computer, to google and then type in @CAPS1 topic and be overwelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an at on the project thats how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick I can make @NUM4 powerpoints slides @CAPS6 with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make powerpoint slide: on overage @PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing @CAPS1 social studies project @TIME1 I had to find out what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library. I just hopped on google and clicked images and clicked images and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds @CAPS1 screen was @CAPS6 with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of facebook, myspace, @CAPS3, or twitter? Well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am @CAPS3 or facebook I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time one of @CAPS1 friend from camp lives in @CAPS10 so I dont get to see her alot so with the wonderful invention of facebook I could talk to her all the time. Just think without the computer facebook would have never been invented so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also when I go on the computer. I have the option signing onto something called @CAPS3 or email. With this I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That would happen if the computer wasnt invented. So dont you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well lets make it @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer.	4	5	9
1054	1	I think computers are very benefical. There are so many uses! From learning, to games, to videos, and to a tool that is very useful. Without computers we would be like the @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 offense any @CAPS1 people). We would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to see becalling news. Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are lots of things to do. You can play online games, off-line games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. Without the internet I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I now am a member of the online community called www.MOCpages.com I post my creations, look at others creations, and comment, and chat. I use the internet to reasearch for school projects. Right now, I am reasearching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Normally I would have to slave over books to find something. Now it is much easier, because keywords are matched. Finally, it is a good fool. Did you know the millitary needs computers to store info, attack, keep record, and to pilot certain planes? I need to use a computer to type up home work, because as you can see, my hand writing isn'@CAPS4 the neatest. Also, I stay in touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I persuaded you on my position. Remember computers, do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a fantastic tool. Thanks for reading, bye!	4	4	8
1068	1	Computers are a huge impact on society, but do they make everything better? People spend way to much time on the computer. Computers do not help you brain they can make you fat and for a lot of people they cause drama. People should stop spending so much time on computers. Computers do not help you brain in any means possible. Think about it, sure you do alot of you work on computers but, what about your kids they spend most of their time gand online and doing pointless stuff. Instead they could be going outside or even study. the internet is open to the world so anyone goes on it and if your child is on the computer is exposed many vile things that will not help them in the future. Its a proven fact that the less time you spend watching tv or on the computer you get better grades. I remember my mom always yelled at me for being on the computer and getting bad grades so she took the computer away for a while and now i have much better grades. So being on the computer does not make you smarter. The computer can make you gain quit a bit of weight. If your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer. So now you are sitting around the computer eating. That can make you gain weight. I know from experience that being active and going outside or exercising really makes you feel good. Once you gain all that weight it is very hard to get rid of it. Sitting around like a couch is not healthy. You can become obese. So you could say your happy with your weight but no one ever said it was healthy. A lot of people have died frombeing that beaky. It puts a huge tall on you life. If you dont want to die from being to heavy then I advise you to get off the computer and go outside and live yor life. The last thing that makes computers so bad is the drama they cause. Mose pople have facebook, aim, or @CAPS1 but if you ask anyone with one of those they will most likley say they have gotten in a fight through one of those. Also now they have something new called formspring which can let you be anomous and people go on yours and just say horrible things. One of my friends was a victim in that and it ruins you. Also their are so many people on facebook that lie about who they are and anyone can easily find out who you are and kill you now a days people know how to hack into peoples computers and get info. So computers can not only be unhealthy but they can be deadly. Why would you want any of those things to happen, when its so easy to just back on your computer time. Remember computers dont help your brain, they can make you fat, and they cause a lot of drama. So please dont use the computer.	5	4	9
1081	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change.	4	3	7
1084	1	Computers is a good benefit for people. First, computer is a helpful machine in diffrent ways, like I personally go on computer and check for my homework with it. Computer is also good because whenever you dont know something, you can just go on the internet and search it. Computers won't effect out health if we dont use it for a long time, computers could help students making project. By using word, exell and other microsoft ware. So I think computers are a great machine for people to have. Secondly, using computer could also socialize with people, many students inculding me uses face book, so even if we are not right next to each other, we can still talk. Computers could be used to make new friends too, but their is people you dont know and we are not surpose to give out our information. said @PERSON1 our health teacher. Computers could be useful to friends that live far away, if your friend moved to another state, you could use computer to chat with him, their is many ways to social with computers. Lastly, exercising is important to everyone, but using computers doesnt mean we can not go outside and exersice anymore, maybe computers are addictive, but if you keep track of time and maybe use the computer for - half an hour at a time, you can still get the exercise you need. Exercising is an easy thing to do, children likes to exercise so their sould not be a problem, like my nabor alway come over to my house and ask if I want to play football while I was talking with someone on the computers but I still went outside and play, so computer is a great machine thats not very addictive so parents doesnt have to worry about children exercising. I think computers have great effects on people, like going online to do a research or talk to friends. Grown ups need them to work. So that proves computer is a great machine.	4	5	9
1087	1	"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. From searching pictures and information for a school projects, watching videos of songs, friends, or tv shows that you love or wonna check up on. to looking at websites. Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously! ""Have you change your mind? have you listened closely?"" @CAPS3 so your life just become a whole lot easier, by using facebook, for social ability, @ORGANIZATION1 and windows programs for school, and google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer!"	6	5	11
1093	1	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much. Well, I disagree with this statement. I think the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer also lets you up a leave more a foriegn people and paces. Lastly, computers helps you communicate with others. As recently stated, I think computers are useful because they help with your hand-eye coordination. For example, when you write papers for school or a document for work, you're using the coordination. You didn't even notice how once hang of typing, you tend to move faster. This machine is a beautiful invention please don't take @CAPS1 away!. The computer is also to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people. Another thing that you dont realizes when using a computer is that the you do from someone in your but from long distance places. How would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas? The computer is the quickest way to find out information! Finally, the computer is an important resource because you can chat with your friends. A @CAPS2 researcher showed that computers You can chat @CAPS3, I think computers has affects on all! They teach hand-eye coordination, they teach you about far away places computer lets you chat online with your friends! I @CAPS4 you see the computer the way I do.	4	4	8
1098	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are several reason how computers have effect on people. My position is to convice the local newspaper why certain people @CAPS2't and @CAPS3 use computers. People getting caught up on the @CAPS4, or people not having enough money to explore the world, so they just be on the @CAPS4. In effect, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you will get caught up. For example, my friend @PERSON1 stay on the computer more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that his on a @CAPS5 line, hooking up with other people. He for gets about everybody. He's so on the @CAPS4. He stop going school, he gaining. Now he just a nobody. He just sit in front of his computer and do nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid @CAPS5 line. @CAPS8's not hard to find another in our city. @CAPS8's alot of beautiful young lady's out here to explore. Similary, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop losing their focus on important, and start paying attention on other things like the, was a great person. She was so successful. She make tons of money. Until she start losing her her job. She stop cause she was so stock on facebook. Facebook is like a place for a friend @CAPS6 you could meet other people from different @CAPS7 you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turn her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now. How she got fired, how she don't pay her bill, and how she moving into a. Sometimes websites make lose focus on important thing in life. Consequently, certain people @CAPS3 use computer because the @CAPS4 help you with certain things. In summation, @CAPS8 help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the @CAPS4. One time I sign up for this website that was called myspace. For moment I did got caught up on @CAPS8. Continue line.	4	5	9
1114	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am here to prosoade you to agree with me on, that the use of computers does benift society. Some reasons why I think this are school work and business stuff. Also the over all reasearch on important things. My first reason why I think that computer use is benifiting society is because @CAPS6 is oftenly used for school work. In example use @CAPS6 for projects. Also some type of reasearch they might be interested in. But one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because, there are a lot of people taking online classes. Wheather its for college or for the sake of your own learning. This is why I think school work shoud be a valid reason for benifiting society. My second reason why I think @CAPS6 benifits our society is the business or job part of the computer. Many people, @CAPS7 a days work at home, they have their own office. They all most create their own company. Another reason is many people also use ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" or publisher. @PERCENT1 of the people who work at public businesses do this, going along with ads, when could also or another reason for this. But then again, you could @CAPS7 pay your bills on line! I remember when I helped my mother pay on of the bills online, and let me tell you, ""@CAPS6 was easy!"". My mother said she do @CAPS6 more often @CAPS7 that she knows how to use @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 the business side should be more then enough, for me to convince you. My last reason is over all reasearch on all important things. Some of these important things are: online catalogs, the news and another one the most important things of all job openings. I know my self, and I love to shop! So instead of leaving the house, I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store called ""@CAPS8"". The main reasons why I go online is b/c they have more variety and sizes. @CAPS7 for the news, thats all for my parents b/c i don't watch the news. Lastly, job openings @CAPS7 that I am @NUM1, I would like to find a job, even if its mimumum wage. @CAPS6's still something, right? This should be a high priced reason for agreement! In @CAPS9, I think my @NUM2 reason are very well clear; school work, business, and over all reasearch. If these reasons don't convince you I dont know what will!?"	5	5	10
1126	1	@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online.	5	5	10
1135	1	"Recently, there has been debate about whether or not computers benefit society. Although each side has its own reasons, computers do have a positive effect on people and on society. Computers are beneficial in several ways. With the use of computers, you have the ability to research and learn about foreign and local places you are able to communicate with others and the help people complete everyday tasks. At one point in everyone's lives, you need to know about local or even foreign places. It is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about. This is where computers come in. Over the internet, you can research everything from the main staple of the diet in @LOCATION3 all the way to the day the new year in @LOCATION1. You learn about things in the comfort of your home, or of your home town. I rember once in @NUM1 grade I had to do a research project on @LOCATION2. By going on the computer, I learned all I needed to know and they some. The project was a breeze, and I got a perfect score. Also, you can learn about local upcoming events, and about the world around you. During childhood, every kid has many questions, some their parents might not be able to answer. Using the computer is a quick and easy way to get these answers. Computers help educate the minds of people and without them, we might not know anything. Communicating with people on the other side of the world is difficult. Mailing a letter could take weeks to reach the recipiant. Computers provide us with a imediate method of communicating with others whether they are local or far away. Last year, my uncle moved to @LOCATION3 for work. I never got to see him.We communicated with each other over computers, and when he came home for christmas, we were as close to each other as we were before he work. Computers kept our relationship healthy and I do not think it would have been that way without them. Scientists say that about @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 have communicated with someone at least once through computers. They also say that @PERCENT2 of these people regurally use this method of communicating. Although we still use phones and ""shall mail"", I do not believe that our society would be able to function socially without the availiable use of computers. Everyday, computers are helping people get through their days with minimal problems. People get things done quicker, giving people more time to do what matters most, interacting with their families. Without computers, everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life. @PERSON1, my neighboor, said ""@CAPS2 and banking are so time consuming. I do not know that I would be able to handle it without the ability to do my banking online."" In addition to takes and hancing, computers help with everything from shopping to woking for the perfect phone company to use for your new business. Having the ability to shop and browse online takes away ariving, walking and checkout line time letting you relax and take your time throughout the rest of your day. Typing also gives you hand-eye coordination without it, you wouldn't be able to do everyday things such as opening the door to playing sports outside with your children using computers helps people get through their lives easier and more efficiently, I could not even imagine life without them. Computers benefit the people of society in every possible way. By helping them obtain knowleage, purifying and strengthening relationships through constant communication ability, and helping make their everyday lives easier, they have a purely positive effect on people everywhere. Computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society."	5	6	11
1151	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is my belief that people are spending too much time on computers. Now a days you can do anything on a computer. Such as, talk to friends, play games, even turn off your lights! But, what are they taking away from us? There taking away communication skills and is same uses creating cyber bullying. They also don't let us enjoy the beauty of nature and exercising. One out of every @NUM1 teens spends more time telling people on the computer then face to face. This way of communication prevents children from learning valuable social skills which come with conversing face to face. This makes @CAPS1 more difficult for children to make friends, or even to do well is work intencies. Studies say by each upcoming generation the communication skills are decreasing by @PERCENT2. Eventually, if @CAPS1 continues to drop at this the will have a world that went. This style of communication has ever a new type of bullying. What have we do to people? You waste over @NUM2 days a year sitting in front of your computer. in this wasted time you could be out going for a jog or walking the day. in fact, the percentage of people that have computer is much greeter than the percentage of people that do not only you exercising for yourself. The computer cant do @CAPS1 for you. Sitting in front of a computer does nothing for your body. You physicaly have to get up and move. Its good for your health, got fresh air. Coming to a point about fresh air @PERCENT1 of people who use computers at home are more likely telecom sick than people who doesnt leave you set seem for sometimes. Seeing nature like never before, I dont think. Yes you can look us the green spotted tree from on the internet, but its nothing like in nature and @CAPS1 is real life. Discoveries cannot be made about new species on the computer, a computer cant find @CAPS1 for your find @CAPS1. People are and less about the environment does to computer. They are seeing a picture not the healthy. After writing this I can te the that I was about myself and personal, which scared me the most I realizes I am becoming more and more dependent on computer each day. I dont seeing friends as. I dont go outside as much, and I don't as much. This true for must people whether you realize @CAPS1 or not I personaly ongoing today and out on time computing you will te. Computer are to much lets for from there hold and deo something more with there lives. This well improve our. So this brings to my final that computers are a bad influence on human and we should use less of them and for ourselves by doing not seeing. Thank you for your time.	5	5	10
1153	1	"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!"	5	4	9
1163	1	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?"	5	5	10
1182	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe computers and excelling technology benefits society because it can help with hand eye coordination, it will be an easy way to learn about faraway places and cultures, and your able to save and use your time more wisely. First of all every person needs hand-eye coordination, if you didn't you would either thore a ball in the comlplete other direction or you'll get hit in the face with it. Computers benefit childrens education too, they can help you discover and learn about far away places. For example if a student is studying @PERSON3 @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class or maybe @PERSON2 in music class, instead of pulling out the old, dustty biography book it would be easier to look them up on a search engine. Lastly the computer benefits everyday working or stay at home parents because if you have to get in contact with a cetain person or business quickly you don't have to take the chance of having to go look in the phone book and the person or business isn't in it, just go to to @NUM1.com type in a last name or business name, so your all set. Also if your child is being a nuisance screaming and running around the house you can just set them up with an educational game so you can get your house-hold chores finished. Those are three of the most important reasons why I think computers benefit society. They are hand-eye coordination, learning techniques and saving everyday people time.	4	3	7
1196	1	Computers do not have a negitive effect on people. They keep you in touch with family, help you do work for school, also allow you to play video games and look up music. Computers can keep you in with family and friends. Find locations to where the live. How their doing and what have they been up to. It allows you to e-mail and lets you see friends that moved far away. Computers also help you to work for school. They help you find answeres to questions a teacher could ask. They help you write reports or reports in general for any subject. Also, there many site that you could go to; to help you with a book.The sites could also bring you to your schools website. That way, if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check. Even if you were absent most papers I questions are on the internet so you could make end to the homework. Another common thing computers are used ten is to weecth movies. Rather a old movie or a new release. Computers also do the same thing for music. Anything from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country and back can be. or new @CAPS3 shows and music all be find. Video games are also popular. Many people play these because; people can friends. Talk to friends that they havent seen in a long time. They to not be bored. If it's raining out and nothing to to the here games. And if you one to talk to thiers always someone there to lister to you and maybe become your friend. So computers are not a waste. They can keep you in touch, you new friends get rid of find an serches everything in @CAPS4 shows, music and movies.	4	4	8
1203	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at my school sit on there computers after school. They don't go outside and enjoy nature. Visit with family and friends or even exercise. @CAPS2 people are affected by this. Going outside can enchance your knowledge, you can go on a walk in the woods. When you are on your walk you @CAPS2 find interesting new species. Also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings. @CAPS2 times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids, you can start a pick of game of baseball. You can also build new things. You could find a big tree and build a treehouse or tireswing with your family. Going outside leaves you with a lot of fun activites. When kids sit on the computer they don't interact with there family or friends. During the @DATE1 you can go to the beach with your friends. It will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner. You @MONTH1 also find the oportunety to go to a different state for the day. Or you could go acros the country to see your sick grandma or your newly named cousin. Going on a picnic will give you time to get to know new people. You could invite friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to met. You will also have a lot of tasty food and who wouldn't want that? Going places with your family and friends can pad to a worth wild experinse. @PERCENT1 of kids chose to go on the computer than to exercise. Kids will become overweight. When on the computer @CAPS2 kids will eat. Eating for hours each day to not a good idea. You can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country. Once you are on the team you will make new friends, and get your exercise for the day. When you are on a team and exercising you will learn @CAPS2 life skills. You will learn the benifits of working as a team and by yourself. So getting your exersise is a very important role in your life. Why would you choose the computer? You wouldn't be able to enjoy the outdoors. Or spend time with family and friends. You would become over weight and unhappy. So, don't choose the computer, choose another activity!	4	4	8
1217	1	I think having computers are good because you can use it to find places. Another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer. You can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework. That is why computers are good and we need them. First reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us. Also we could look at places we never saw before and if you want to get some where you can go the computer to do that.	2	2	4
1228	1	Hi! I am writing in which computers are a bad thing to the society or good thing. I think that computers are good thing to have around. They help us in a lot of way and they also help us find new friends and new updates. This is going to be my first opinion. I think that computers have effects on the society in a good way because people can find @CAPS1 of the latest updates on the weather, society and country's. It helps the society in a good way because people don't have to look though an old Newspaper. All they have to do is click and there there reading it all and probally seeing pics and stuff of it. This is my second reason why computers are a good effect on the society they help us in a lot of ways on which meeting new people and staying in close good with them and talking with them and sending pics of stuff and you. My last opinion for computers are a good effect on society is that @CAPS2 you have a buissness or anything you can sell any of your merchandise, keep buiness plans, And also you can make a website for your business after a while @CAPS1 of people will know about it and it would make a really big inpack on your buiness. That was my three opinion on which why computers are good effect on the society and I think that computers are really good effect on the society.	4	4	8
1245	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard over @CAPS2 @NUM1 @CAPS3 that that people believe comuters have different effects on people. To the past computers have caused problems with the human body. Amny @CAPS5 are becoming to on computers. So in my question I believe computers have a neagtiove on. First of all computers have caused @CAPS5 to not exercise and become unhealthy. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS5 have said they are their @CAPS5 are spending to each time on the computer. @CAPS5 need to realize that sitting on a computer @CAPS4 is a danger to their health you don't want you @CAPS5 to have eye problems in the do you? To the to be on the computer to much and just for work, but for playing games I realize enough I need to stop and go out and exercise to keep well-balanced health @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS4 technology increases the more and more people we have given glasses too."" @CAPS5 need to make changes to what they do during the. So @CAPS4 I somputers because @CAPS5 are not become unhealthy. My people do not spend @CAPS4 much time with family and friends. In the pase my mon used to yell at me. @PERCENT1 of people believe is very important did you know that. Computers keep your divorce could have from computer. People need to within families because it decrease interaction with. My last reason is that people are not. @NUM4 ot of @NUM3 people enjoying nature you a chance to express your thought. Many people need time to think about what is happening in their life and they cannot do this our internet. TO the past stressed because I never had a to just relax and think about things I computer doing something or homework. @PERCENT2 of people who have to much going life believe that they. Do you now see that nature can be helpful? So @CAPS4 you can see computers have a negative effect because people don't get enough time to enjoy nature. To conclusion I believe computers have a huge negative effect on people. The reasons why be people would be less active, people will not interact @CAPS4 well & people enjoy nature. So I strongly you to vote being a negative effect."	5	5	10
1263	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that more people should start using computers. They can offer things that just writing things down or a pece of paper cant, like being able to learn about things that aren't taught in school, you can talk with friends online and you can keep everything in one. The first reason I think more people should use computers is that they can learn about things that arent taught in. Such as current events, the history of our nation and how our government works. Now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on @CAPS1 or a newspaper. But the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video. Also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on @CAPS1. Another reason I think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet. This is great because there @MONTH1 be people you havent seen in awhile because they moved. I had a friend who moved to pitsburg when I was @NUM1 and when I got u @CAPS3 account I was able to find him and talk with him a while of him visiting. Or you can just keep in touch with friends that so to a different school. The last reason I think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures, videos, document and contacts on your hard time. This is important to because I am not very well organized when it comes to school. But I started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer. This helped me be less clutteres and keep all my work in our place. It also means you can email that walk to a teacher or notes a friend who might have missed school that day. So in conclusion that or why I think we should have peple we computers more. They can help you learn, let you talk with friends, or let you keep everything in one place. That is why I think more people should use computers.	5	4	9
1268	1	People use computers everyday. There's so many reasons way the're always on. They could be talking to one of their family relatives. Also they're probally looking for jobs. There's many things and people shouldn't tell them what to do with their lives. Many people in @LOCATION1 use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things. Also they could be talking to one of their family relatives. There's a thing called webcam and people in @LOCATION1 use it so they could see one another. Buisnesses people are always on the computer because they need to print out documents and they probally got to send something to another country. Buisnesses people also do lots of work on the computer. They can still exercise in @TIME1 for a quick jog, but also thats their choice if they want to stay health or not, plus they're busy people. Other hand people who go on the computer and who are not buisness people or they're not talking to family member or an old friend are students and parents. Tons of students in @LOCATION1 have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information. Parents on the other hand also help out their children and they also talk to their relatives or these looking for a new home or job. If all those people are busy let them do their work they want for need to do. Once their done they could excerise but if they don't want to and other people told them to go not take a walk or anything healthy then it's their lost. We can't some them too. They're just getting better everyday and it's not effecting us. its effecting them. If they want to be on the computer they're also getting bad eye-sight because of too much light.	4	4	8
1278	1	Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people not great but its good for many reasons, for now I have three reason why its good, my reasons are, search new places meet new people, when people have nothing to do, and teenagers that cant be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they dont have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they dont have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also thre are many websites of movies. My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer. teenagers are teenagers they must have technology. If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop. This is my opion on the effects computers have on people.	4	4	8
1279	1	"Computers benefit society, people can socialize online with anyone. You can use the internet to communicate with people all over the world. I talk with my pen pal from @LOCATION2 almost all the time with vidio char, the most popular websites today are social. For example facebook, myspace, and twitter, thease days @PERCENT1 of people have an account on at least one of thease websites and that number grows everyday. @CAPS1 live has made vidio games a lot more social. @NUM1 in @NUM2 kids are playing with a friend they know while playing @CAPS1. By useing computers your hand eye coordination will increase significant key hand eye coordination is used in a lot of sports. ""I don't know if I'd be @CAPS2 good of a tennis player without useing a computer to boost my hand eye coordination. ""@PERSON1 you can use hand eye coordination to do stuf faster. I can copy notes so much faster because I can write and look at the bord at the same time. Wheather you relize it or not hand eye coordination is very inportent computers can improve hand eye coordination by @PERCENT2. People can use computers to learn online. When you go on the internet you can learn about cool places and plan vacations. For @DATE1 break me and my dad used the internet to learn about @LOCATION1 we then decided to go there and bought tickets. You can learn about interesting people in history. There are over ten billion articals about famouse people in history. On the internet you can also learn new resipys if you are a cook. ""@CAPS2 an @ORGANIZATION1 I learned most of my cooking online."" - @ORGANIZATION1. Online you can also learn how to improve your technice in sports. Before I joined the swim team I looked up on the internet how to improve your swim technice and how I qualifyed to go to @CAPS3 with my team because the internet inproved my time by two seconds wich was enough for me to go. I belive the computer is an amazing invention that has tremendosely inpacked socioty."	5	4	9
1284	1	"I think that the advances of technology to the computer are great and more beneficial than bad. Say you struggle at school and need serious help, you can turn to a computer for help, say you have a dear friends that a week ago moved to florida, you can use the computer to contact them. And finally if you want to learn about the world, great! Google search places to learn about. These are just a few reasons why the computer is helpful as opposed to bad! School one of many students least favorite activities, yet you can use the internet to help you out, @CAPS1! say you are in geometry and it is kicking you're butt, got to @PERSON1 academy for informational videos. Maybe you are a third grade teacher and the little kids are driving you nuts, go to @LOCATION1, and educational and fun website. Maybe you just want to relax and learn, plug in earphones and listen to math help. These are merely a few ways that the internet helps with schooling. What if it is a really rainy rainy day and you are tired and want to learn about faraway places in a logical person's head, the internet pops into their head. Think of the computer as a big easy to acess library, type something into a search engine and it pops up. What if you are in germany and you are hungry, oh no! Everything is in @CAPS2! open your laptop for easy translation. All of these things support that the internet makes learning about foreign places easy. And finally, communication is really easy, with the internet because, there use emails, skypes, chatrooms etc. internet's middle name is communication. What if your phone is gone and there is an emergency, you can get the email! What if a burgalor cuts the phone lines and sneaking your house e-mail @NUM1. And finally internet can be used to call @PERSON2 and tell him, ""don't forget the red bull"" as he leaves. Those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication. Go let's recap on this paper. Internet is great for communication. Also help with learning about far away places. And finally help with schooling. These are the reasons I think internet is valuable in this day in age. "	4	4	8
1288	1	I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today.	5	5	10
1307	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 posission on the computer contraversy issue is that computers are good and so vital in todays everyday world. Computers are a good way to communicat, they are most people main source of info and buisnesses use computers for various importanat task as well. Computers are a great way to comunicate. You can @CAPS2 with your friends, email your peers and now there are website you can go on where you can talk to your friends or a stranger. Being human I do sometimes forget @CAPS1 homework or school asignments. In that situation I would just go on @CAPS1 computer and @CAPS2 a friend asking them for the assignment. Its quick easy and it works. There are also websites where you can talk and connect with other people who share the same interests as you. Its a good way to make an online friends. The computer goes beyond just allowing you to talk enables you to connect with people no matter where you are. Do you ever have a question that you instantly want or the to? Just go to ""google"" or ""@CAPS4"", tpye in your question and recieve an immediatly. AHve a reaserch paper due on @PERSON1? You can do all of your reaserch online. There are thousands of website loaded with information can anything and evrything. Youc an enter yout topic a search engine and find hundreds of sources that way. You can easily fine information any subject you want, or find the name of that song you just heard on the using your computer. COmputer are used in buisness environment too. Computers are used for getting messages to different people in the. They are also used to create and presernt presentations marketing campains and now product ideas, also many companies use the internet as a source of advertiring and need the bublicity to sell their. So the computer is necessary for to function as well. So in conclusion computers are not over used, they are just used for so many things that at some point every one will nead one. They are a good way to communicate, an important and main source of info and they are also used in buisness environments too."	4	5	9
1324	1	Dear local Newspaper, I think people using a computer has a effect. using a computer can help people in many ways. You can talk to people world wide, it helps you stay organized, and you can create very useful things like a or a power point using a computer. Talking to people world wide can be a very useful thing. Say that you have family members that live in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 you can keep in touch with them by e-mail or video chat. Also, if there is a national and nedds to talk to the other, governers around the world for advices help he can do that quickly and easily. Using a computer can also help you stay organized. For example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the light places. Imagine all of the papers and space he would use if he had to do by hand or didnt use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e-mail parents, and even create test or quizes and they know it will be nice and organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desk. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make alot of other things like power points. Power points can help them put alot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising. Lastily, you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday for alot of different people. Talking to worldwide can help you stay in, so you dont lose connection with your. They also have effect they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typeing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them?	4	4	8
1338	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have a positive affect on people because they help students as well as many others study, they allow you to access stores by shopping online and computers allow people to communicate. After reading this letter, I assure you that you will agree with me. The first reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because they help students as well as many other people study. If you have a test or quiz in @CAPS1, you can go on your computer and print out @CAPS1 practice sheets. Or if you have a vocabulary exam you can find the definitions fast and easy on the computer. In the times @ORGANIZATION1, a statistic shows that @PERCENT2 of students in the @ORGANIZATION2 find computers there best studying tool. They find it affective and fast to use. Last night, I had a test on the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I went online, typed in ""The @CAPS3 @CAPS4"", and found @MONTH1 helpful cites on it. It was useful and did not waste my time. Using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier but their is on even greater one. Secondly, computers have a positive affect on people because it saves people time by shopping online. So many stores now allow you to purchase stock on me. it is easy .with a click of a button and saves you time driving to the stores. In @ORGANIZATION1, it showez that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 across the @ORGANIZATION2 said shopping online improved their lives by making it less hectic from driving from store to store. Shopping online creates a positive, less hectic life for many people around the world. Online shopping having a positive affect on people by making their lives less busy is a great reason but there is one last even greater one. The last most important reason why computers have a positive impact on people is because it allows people to communicate with each other. Communication through computers are extremely powiar. With instant messaging or email of even blackboard, a new teacher-student communication site, computers are often being used for communication. i surveyed @NUM1 kids and @NUM2 said that computers are there main source of communication. Communication through computers it has a positive affect on people in many ways like to communicate easier for work, to talk to your best friend on e-mail who just moved to @LOCATION2, or to simply send out invitations for a party to all your friends. Computers have made life easier for many through communication, making a positive effect on them. This is why communication having a positive affect on people is the most important reason. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people because it allows them to study easier, saves people time by shopping online, and allows people to communicate. With all the ways computers help us there is no reason why they would negatively affect us. I know that you will take this into cons ideration. Computers are making our lives easier day by day and who knows what they will be able to do in the future."	4	5	9
1360	1	I support the advance in technology especially in computers. Using the computer can teach hand-eye coordination, give you the ability to learn about faraway places or people, and give you the opportunity to talk online with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill to have. it quickens reflexes during everyday life. Hand-eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball, football, or basketball. Without computers, many people would lack hand-eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country, but doesn't know anything about it, he could lost it we on the internet. The internet is a major part in having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Some people @MONTH1 think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise, which is true in some cases, but the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computers is almost a neccesity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they @MONTH1 know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend, and one day meet them in real life. This @MONTH1 be dangerous for younger people, so be careful. I support the advancement in computer technology because it gives people greater reflexs, gives people the opportuniyt to research faraway places, and gives people access to the internet to chat with people online. These are three huge advantages than using computers give people.	4	4	8
1391	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I understand you think computers dont have an effect on people. Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. It also helps you with your work. Never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decition that you want to make.	4	4	8
1395	1	"@CAPS1 dinners ready okay mom, one second' click, click, click. Are you hearing this from your children than usual? Well if you are than you need to listen to this upcoming message. We the @ORGANIZATION1 believe are children and adults are spending too much time in their laptops or computers. They're not out exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with their family, these problems could lead to begger problems that @MONTH1 have already taken affect like: @CAPS2, financial problem and then to depression. So keep reading and think what you hear that could or has happened to you. @CAPS2 is a huge thing to worry about kids all over @LOCATION1 are on their computer than outside. Ever day I see my nephew on his computers I see him getting fatler and fatts every day. Studies have shown that children and adults that own as facebook or myspace account, they gaim about @NUM1 pounds every @NUM2 moths. If they're even on @NUM3 to @NUM2 hours a day they'll gain @NUM5 pounds every month. Sooner or later the state is going to have the @CAPS2 level from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people who are obesy. This could lead to loss @ORGANIZATION1 jobs laziness. When people spend most @ORGANIZATION1 their time on facebook and myspace than they could lose their job's. More than @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 the state citizens own a facebook or myspace. So when people are addicted to them they're spend more time on that thatn the steff the have to do for their jobs. So then they'll get firm one can't pay bills, loans, and mortage. This then will all tead to depression. Depression is all over the state even the country. People are losing jobs left and right cause their computers and internets. People are even comiting climer like murded and even attemps @ORGANIZATION1 suicide cause @ORGANIZATION1 loss @ORGANIZATION1 jobs or family members. Some people are even so addicted to the internets and girths @ORGANIZATION1 new born family member. This depression needs to stop. So fight for the right to stop the addiction @ORGANIZATION1 internet use and live a great life. Drop the computer sead as book, meet up with friends and family, keep your jobs. Don't let these reson come between you and your life."""	5	4	9
1412	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Readers, Some of you might think people exercise computers. They don't act outside enough or interact with family or pets. You also @MONTH1 think that they are not getting enough exercise.Well you are right but I am going to explain way your wrong. You can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. The first thing you could do is learn. While you are on the internet you can go to learning websites. Some of thoes websites can teach you about faraway places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 for example, you could learn their culture and the @CAPS5 they celebrate and why. Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. Another thing you could do so the computer is socialize. You might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends. Well you can. There are websites like @CAPS6 and facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now you can webcam people. When you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam. Lastly you could go into chatrooms like @CAPS7 ( aol instant message ) and talk to people while you are on that sight. The last thing you can do is become more healthy. Is it not surprising? yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com car give you a might eating schedual right for your . After that website you could go out and get the you will need. Another thing that the computer offers is hand-eye coordination. While you are looking at the screen your had is controling the "" mouse"" while the, mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. Lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world. So now hopefully you agree with me that computers do acctually benift some things in life. I have showed you what you can learn about, talk to people and socialize and lastly help you with your health. "	5	5	10
1414	1	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in would floor. Surely, computers allow you @CAPS2 my cousin on the computer and @CAPS3 important to note that, on computers you can play games that can help you with your school-work. You can go on sites that you on your @CAPS4. Show you how your body works for @CAPS5, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are not boring. This a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didnt. The time is now! Just think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because no matter what, people will always have time for that.	4	4	8
1419	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not excersizing. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average familly had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average familly has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then, because people are almost always on the computer, rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technologie has hur t our nation, is that there is an immence lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the parents should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exeed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their-heads with nonesence. Now, computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull, but do children use them that way? The answer in no, and, ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults"", state @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations. If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer-drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health."	5	5	10
1462	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a world where the uneployment rate rises sinificgently, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just discapeared. I think computers are more benefical to society then some people relize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an acountend. Computer games and @CAPS2 help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teen how to become sucessful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now acess grades in a heartbeat. My computer helps me.	4	3	7
1465	1	Dear @PERSON1, I am on the side of computers. You @MONTH1 think I'm only saying that because I'm @NUM1 years old and it is basically what I do for fun. Computers do benefit society because they are fun, a source of communication, good for schooling and education, and for work. Computers are not just the @CAPS1 but also @CAPS6 procesor and @ORGANIZATION1 and everything like that. Computers provide games for everyone from ages @NUM2 to @NUM3. When it is raining outside your parents are at work and you are by yourself and have nothing to do, turn on the computer. Play a game. There are many fun websites made for everyone. Computers also provide an exellent source of communication. There are all different kinds of @CAPS2-mail. @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and many other sites are exellent for talking to friends. Not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via @CAPS5 or any of the others it is nice to chat. Computers provide an exellent source of education. If you are doing a history project and you need more information and pictures, log onto a computer and @ORGANIZATION3 it. At our school we have edline which tells us all of our homework assignments. It is extremly handy. Now they also have schooling tutors online. It is great. Computers are great for work. @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION5, and other @ORGANIZATION2 wear or other compnies. You can find your information and make something out of it. It is very, very useful for buisness workers. As you can see, computers have a lot of great uses. I think computers effect people in a positive way by helping them in positive ways. Computers allow fun, communication, educational purposes, and work uses. Computers are a good thing to have around, @CAPS7't you think?	4	4	8
1470	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you like a place where you can control what you @CAPS1 and where you go? I know I @CAPS1. Well, if you afree with me then the computer is your cup of tea I think that computers have a positive effect on society. I think this for @NUM1 main reasons @CAPS2 with others, getting constant updates on whats going on, and a learning tool make up only some of the fasinating aspects the computer has. So read on I know you will think the same way as me about computers given my knowledge below. The computer captures over @NUM2 million humans attention with online social networks facebook, myspace, and @CAPS3 are the main attractions. In all of these websites you can keep up with whats going on with your friends and whats new around the world. These online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure. All these websites provide the information that people want and keep nthem logging back on everyday. I think these websites are great and can only improve society. This is my first benefit of a computer. Another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society. Many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show. They provide pictures, stories, and actual videos of whats happening right now. The computer helps us americans know what is happening in @LOCATION1 and lets @LOCATION1 know whats happening in the @LOCATION1 and the @CAPS4.S arn't the only ones trough The computers provides international news and gossip for everyone. Here is another reason why the computer is great for society. There are many things that us kids don't know and if we need some deep information we search it on the computer. The computer provides websites giving information on every time you could think of. For example, if I were to be stuck on some science homework I could probably type in my question on ask.com and get a great answer. Parents and teachers want their kids to suceed and the computer defenitly helps. In conclusion, I have given you @NUM1 great, well thought out reasons why the computer benefits society. @CAPS2 with others, updates worldwide and information on school all are in a great piece of technology called the computer. I hope you will trust me that the computer has a positive effect on society.	5	5	10
1487	1	Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or whatever you talk to your friends are. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be much interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but thats not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there, but then what would be the fun of that. For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, dont you feel great when your going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful I am thankful to god of giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, georgus. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else or even riding your @CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but beacuse of the computer they got that wich really stinks. Now as you can you see computers really can change your life. So that's your discision. Pick wrong from right, all up to YOU. Now make it.	4	4	8
1493	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers do benefit society in a positive way. Without computers we would not be able to be as social. We also would not have the ability to do reseach for school online and running a business would be even more difficult. Without computers our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. the main way of being social these days, other than texting, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a skype and facabook, and I am able to access them everyday. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and texting. Everyday I workout and lift weights and go on facebook, that is why that whole statement, ""spending less time exercising, and more time on the computer"" is false. Facebook and skype are a past of my everyday life and without them I know I would not be as social. Computers are also a part of my everyday life, because I have to use it to do research for school or typing up an @CAPS5 paper. As you have now seen, my handwriting is not so great, so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it. Without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work. Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade, which is not as presentable. Overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework. Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers some businesses would be unable to function, and those could function, would be awful slow. Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers, if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined. Computers also simplify work for businesses, they speed up the tasks that would takes a long time to be hand done and they complete the tasks that could not be acheived without a computer. Computers play a large part in the @CAPS6 of the world."	5	6	11
1501	1	Do you think that computer's are good? Well, I do. There are many reasons why I and you should think, this. For example, it has possitive effect on people, it teaches hand-eye coordination, and it allows people to talk to online with other people. One reason why you should think that computers are good is it has a positive effect on people!! Don't you want to be happy. well then, computers is your online fun source!! And your an learn a lot from computer!! Another reason is that the computers teaches hand-eye coordinbation. Hand-eye coordination is excellent skill that you need in life. For example, lets say that you want to play baseball, and you have no hand-eye coordination and you trip and @DATE1 and you brake something. that isn't good for you, is it. No, it is not good. But, if you had better hand-eye coordination then you probably wouldn't have fallen! The @NUM1 reason is that, you can interact with others online. You can @CAPS1, you can go on chat rooms. Or you can go on gaming sources, and interact with other people!! And, you can go online dating! The computer is a greet way to meet new people that share the same characteristics as you!! If you already have a computer then your fine. But, if you don't then you need to get one. And I am right!! People that don't have a computer have no jb. because people with jobs most of the time have use or have computer. In conclusion, you need to get a computer!! Why? well, that because you can alot of stuff on a computer. For example, you can teach hand eye coordition, and you can chat with online friends. Also, it gives you a possitive effect.	4	4	8
1519	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that people are spending to much time on there computers and not exercising as they're supouse to do every day. @CAPS5 @CAPS3 says that @PERCENT1 of all people in the intere world are spending to much time on the @CAPS3 and not enjoying nature. So they don't get exercis like other people do. @CAPS5 @CAPS4 says that people that go out side and not stair at there computers will live a long and helthy life. I say that @PERCENT2 of all people that are always on the @CAPS3 often go blind and will never see who the world is changing awound them. I say that @PERCENT3 of all people that don't always go on the @CAPS3 will live a better life then the people that are always on the @CAPS3. My @CAPS5 told me that you should go on the @CAPS3 just not for a very long time because beeing on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not so good for you so don't go on the @CAPS3 for a very long time only for a short amount of time and don't go on the @CAPS3 every day only like @NUM1 time a week. People that have @CAPS6 book acounts you shouldn't go on it like every day go on like @NUM1 to @NUM3 time a week because going on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not good for people. My @CAPS5 @CAPS8 says that @PERCENT4 of all people in the world have @CAPS9 and ofthen go blind because of them using the @CAPS3 all the time and that if you go on it for to long your @CAPS3 will mealt down and brake. I realy think that people shouldn't go on the @CAPS3 for every long time because every time they go on is a time that they will miss in the life so please don't do it.	4	4	8
1526	1	Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a posotive effect on people. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. I think that both these opinions are correct. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habbit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. Using computers is something I know millions of people use everyday, and would think @CAPS2 would be difficult to live without. For example, my family owns four computers. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. For my mom, @CAPS2's usually working or checking her e-mails. For me and my sister, @CAPS2's researching and typing of homework, and communicating with our friends via facebook or. So say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn. Before these were computers, everyone used, but now that we have the internet, theres no really need to get a book. Most of the time people wont even have the book their looking either have to go out and buy get one from the library. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet thats quick, and. People also use computers to like I mentioned above with maybe facebook, @CAPS1, or e-mail.@CAPS2's quick, easy and fun. @CAPS2 also saves paper which helps the planet. We always use to send letters, but now with these sources, you don't need to much! Computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring. Now even though I mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. So many people use computers everyday, and @CAPS2's bad for your physical and mental health. People spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. This means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. They wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. In conclusion, I'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements.	5	5	10
1534	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 oppinon about computers are that people should use them. Think about your children, when they grow up they will need to know how to use a computer for school, or even a job. It also teaches hand eye cordanation for multi tasking. The computer is also fun and easy to use. I am almost positve that you love to use a computer, who dosn't? @CAPS2 first reason is that you will need to use a computer in everyday life. For example if you are going to a job interview most @CAPS3 will ask how meny words a minuet can you type you need to be proficant. Also at school if you have a writing asinment due then it would take more time writing it than typeing it. All @CAPS3 you will have to type one time or another. Aspesaily your job as an @CAPS1 you need to use a computer everyday. The computer also teaches hand eye cordanation. Hand eye cordanation is kinda like multi tasking you could type and talk on the phone or even excircising and txting. Hand eye cordanation is a very important skill in life. All @CAPS3 you will need to multi task like at a library you need to find a book and talk to people. Even driving a car you need to multi task to stay on the hand, you need to use one fast from brake and gas and you need to be looking at the road. You must to multi task along with hand eye cordination. Your in luck a computer teaches you. @CAPS2 last and final reason is its fun and easy to use. I was @NUM1 when I started uing a computer I loved to play fun games. I never could type but I caught on because if you are having fun while you it will be easy to turn. Just like math its not fun but you have to larn how to do it. So if you like having fun while lurning some thing the computer is for you. It's now or never for people to larn, get @CAPS3 and get good grades. Its fun and easy to lurn how to use. It teaches you hand eye cordanation plus multi tasking. You will absolutly need to know how to use a computer for @CAPS3 and school. We need computers for life we always will need to use computers for every single day of our lives. Don't tell people it will note your brain or you will become unhelthy from being on the computer look past it. Don't you see all the good uses for computers?	4	5	9
1544	1	I People spend too much time on the computer. A lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day. They should be spending time with family and friends. People never have enough time for activities. Also computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends, homework,research, games @CAPS1 bored, and work. To begin with, people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than on the computer. For example @CAPS1 your mother or father asked you @CAPS1 you wanted to go out to dinner and you said no, I'm on the computer, that would just mean your obsessed with going on the computer. A lot of families are bing broken apart because people spend too much time on the computer @CAPS1 you have a friend over and they say I am bored and all you are doing is play games on the computer than that is just being rude because your friend is bored. So you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones. Previously I stated how people spend time with loved ones, well people need to spend more time doing activities as well. A lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat. @CAPS1 you are gaining weight because your on the computer than you need to go do some activite to off that fat. @CAPS1 you are a teen and you are given the idea to play a sport and you it because computer is more important then is some serious obesession with the computer. As a result, the computer should be used wisely. The computer should be used to talk to family and friends, homework, research, work, and @CAPS1 you bored play some games little games on the computer. Those are probably the most important things that should most likely used for the computer. A lot of these things that I have listed are important because @CAPS1 you go on the computer just to be on and watch people talk then what's the point of wasting your time on the computer when you could be doing much more different things on the computer. For example, @CAPS1 you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions you can go to www.dictionary.com to find them, or @CAPS1 you just need to define a simple word. In conclusion, people spend too much time on the computer. They need to be spending more time with family and friends. Also people need to be doing more activities in their lives. Lastly, you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research. So, as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things.	5	5	10
1546	1	Dear @CAPS1, People use computer all over the world, for one reason or another, but they are very necessary in our world. That is why computers have a good effect on people today. They help us contact distant family members. Kids rely on them for studying or homework. Adults need them for their jobs, like sending emails or typing a proposal. Thats why computers have a good effect on us. Like me, many kids have family across the ocean or just across the country, either way, contacting them is tough. Calling them @MONTH1 be expensive in most cases and sending letters certantly take to much time to reach them. With email, the message will be sent quickly and free. You can also have conversations through email with no problem. Another very effective way to contact family is through skype or a web cam. This way you can see your family from miles away in the comfort of your own home. Computers help kids too. Kids like me always have homework on the computer. It could be typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure, either way they both require a computer. Sure, there are books to take notes on people, but do books type up papers? Kids and teenagers can also use them for studying. I constantly use the computer to practice spanish buy using a website with worksheets a flash card to help me. Computers nbot only help kids, they help adults too. MAny adults in @LOCATION1 and othe countries are business men and woman. They are constantly sending emails, typing proposals and all those things. And without a computer all that would be very challenging. Business men are not the only ones doing that though. My father, an electrition, has to sned out emails and documents about his latest project several times a week. Aside from work, we use them in our everyday lives. For example, ordering clothes and toys, but most popular is doing your taxes online. It is quicker easier and that is why @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 finish their taxes online. Computers have a good effect for people of this age. Not only i sthat my opinion, it is also more of a fact. They help us stay connected with distant relatives, help our children stay on top in school and help our parents and other adults in their jobs in everyday lives. Not only are they helpful, but they are necessary and I hope your agree with me.	6	4	10
1553	1	"Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!"	3	4	7
1554	1	Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to.	4	4	8
1559	1	Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 I'm @PERSON1, @CAPS2 going to tell you some positeves & negatives: The truth about computers. First @CAPS2 going to tell you some positives about computers. The internet is a virtual at your finger tips, it provides the smartest questions to the most questiners. In the internet every thing is more easy, I mean all you have to do to learn how it works is to use a keyboard & mouse. Computers have changed over the years, from to have . Yes computers have there are popular chatting websites @CAPS3, facebook, twitter, flickr. It seems cool yes but the internet has a very darkside too! Second, here are some dark secret of the computer. So far in the news there have been reports of suicide of the teenager life, reports like: girls killing themselves because lack of . Boys killing themselves because . Yes we do live in a world where everyone is judged by how they . Well there you have it computers are good & bad we just have to be .	4	3	7
1563	1	Computers, one of the daily things we use and @CAPS1 with. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers! I love computers but, I as a teen know about managing your time on the computer. You cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer. The amount of time wasted on your computer could be the time you might be outside haveing fun. Theres lots of things you could do outside! As for some exsamples: @CAPS1 come ball, run around, go to the park, go exploring etc... Friends and family are very entertaining, I have lots of friends and I love them all! If you have some spare time you should hang out with them and have some fun, go to the mall! I always go to the mall with my friends insted of playing on the computer for hours on end. So get of the computer and go @CAPS1! Have some fan in the sun today.	3	3	6
1564	1	I disagree what people say about computers. Likewise of corse they teach hand eye coordination. But they are not good enough for people. Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people.	4	4	8
1582	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial. Thank you for your time."	5	5	10
1589	1	Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physicly, and mentaly, @CAPS2. @PERSON1, my aunt an former physisist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, @CAPS3 because of these new ideas involving phones and i-pods are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into commiting a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like? My brother learned swearing from the new & advanced game of @CAPS5. It's a fighting game (@CAPS6!) I implore your company to make the righty decision and write to help pull us off of our butts and get us up and going strong again. I hope you take my advice, and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort.	5	5	10
1590	1	Dear Local @CAPS1: I'm sitting at the couch thinking about what I should do for vacation. I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to do same creative writing, but my notebooks are all scattered, I don't know how to quickly contact someone who could help and I have no idea about the country that I plan to visit. I take a last look at my notebooks strewn about the closet looking very much like a tornado swept through and I find solution on the highest shelf my laptop. First, I highly agree with the people who think computers are useful. Three effects they have on people who use them usely are fantastic. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop @MONTH1 be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances a part, so they use e'mail and @ORGANIZATION1. They travel places with people at their fingertips. However a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people. Their schedule could be chaotic. Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective. Take my story for example. My mom hates wasting, so instead of me driving to a friend we @CAPS2. Saves money and time! In addition, I happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks. I've written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling all over my room. What organizational tool could help me in this situation? Why a laptop of course! One laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze. Anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer! What you a room notebooks that you buy of, or a single, computer with tons of space and back up? You tell me. Computers encourage users to be more organized! Respectively, computers are resource for a millions of pages information. They're similar to libraries. But think about a library and then imagine a computer. One you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some @MONTH1 argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org' and'.gov' and even'.edu'. These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research. By using computers I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial. They have effectively made me more intellgent as a person. In conclusion, it's my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects, and these include money/gas-saving conversations through @CAPS2 and email organization and increased intelligence from reading. I've decide to take my creative writing on my laptop and in doing so learned the storm.	6	5	11
1591	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that you have asked people to tell their opinions on the effects computers have on people. In my opinion computers do not have a good effect. The reason I think that is because kids are on the computer instead of doing their homework, people do not exercise as much because they are always on the computer and they do not spend as much time with their family and friends, @CAPS2 are many kids that go on the computer all night and never get to doing their homework. I read an article that said, ""Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework."" People get @CAPS4 distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes don't do their homework because they get distracted on the computer. I interviewed a student in the @NUM1 grade and she said, ""@CAPS3 class inastly gets all homework done but sometimes we forget when we are on the computer. That is really the only reason we don't do @CAPS1."" @CAPS4 computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of @CAPS1. But that is not the only bad thing about them. Since people are always on computers they don't get out and exercise as much. Instead they sit and play games on a computer. I found this quote in an article I was reading ""@CAPS5 since I started spending a lot of time on the computer I have gained weight because I am not out exercising,"" Exercising and going outside is a very important things to do but people cannot do @CAPS1 if they are always on the computer. Nine out of ten people say that @CAPS5 since they started going on the computer a lot, they have not gone outside or exercised in a while. I interviewed a women and she said, ""I had to not go on the computer for a while because I realized that @CAPS1 was not good for me and I needed exercise."" People get @CAPS4 distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore. @CAPS2 are still some reasons why computers are not very good. Spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do, but with computers people to not do @CAPS1 that much anymore. In a magazine I read @CAPS1 said, ""People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are keeping people from spending time together. Nine out of ten families say that they have realized they don't spent as much time together because of computers. I interviewed some kids and said, "" I don't spend a lot of time with family or friends. I am mostly on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are deffinitely not a good thing for families. Those are the reasons why I think computers do not have a good effect on people. Kids are on the computer and don't do their homework, people do not exercise as much and they don't spend as much time with family or friends."	4	5	9
1609	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the years computers have gotten faster smaller smarter, these advances have led to mankind as we know it advancing, but the effects that come with @MONTH1 be non profitable to the youth of the computer world. Some common effects computers have on people, mostly children are, preventing kids to play outside, tbe active, computers prevent people from using their immagination they also are a waste of time. Everyday a child across america will use the same old exuse, ""no mom, im not on facebook, im doing my @CAPS4 report"", while infact they haven't even started it, or they hours ago are now goofing around on line, but ask your self. ""did this happen thirty years ago? no your parents who grew up then were thrilled to an outside when thire assignments were compleated. They could not wait to get on that flaming red bike t go play ball with joey. Kids these days are becoming less active t egar to play outside f people blame obbisity on genetics while it probbly should be blamed on computers, sucking children to them. Because kids never want to leave the side of their beloved computer to go outside they are using less + less of their immagination. parents tell storys of when they would watch the one new episode of their favorite show + what whole week the kids in the neighborhood would take roles + act it out. but do you see that every day in this generation not at all. No one that or imaginn any thing new about it with friends to make it more fun they only move onto the wii five minuets later to play a smashing ballons game. Computers just up all of your time the average kid will spend up to four hours on the computer just falling around with no purpose. Wasting the time they could be improving homework or walking the dog the time is not bring donated to a good source. it is not being effective most times. they say computers are the now generation but dose that mean that the now generation must be, lazy, unimmaginitive, and not care what their time is put towards. Most people will say no we are not but you offer a nine year old to play on the computer or, oh say go outside! You would be ignorant to think they would go out to play. People want to move forward but can we not make a compromise?"	4	5	9
1613	1	Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive affect on society because it gives a lot of information, it has lots of fun games and music, and it informs you about issues in the world and communities. The first reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because its gives you lots of information. If you need to do projects and research, what better way to do them than on a computer. You can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and people that made a change in the world. You can also look @CAPS5 and study different kinds of plants and animals, and you can find fasmating experiments to do. The second reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music. You can go on the @CAPS1 channel website and play lots of diffrent games from your favorite t.v shows. They also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your @ORGANIZATION2 such as comprehension clinic. The computer also has lots of music that you can listen to. You can listen to @ORGANIZATION1's album. I am @PERSON1 before You @CAPS2 it, or @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 before buying the @NUM1 songs. The fina; reason I think that computers have a positive effect on society is because it gives you information about issues in the world. You can go on a computer and search @CAPS5 natrual disasters like @CAPS8 earthquake, @CAPS9 earthquake, or information about the tsunami that @MONTH1 hit @LOCATION2. You can search @CAPS5 @CAPS10 @PERSON3 and get information. You can search your favorite artist and see what their albums gonna be like or you can search @CAPS5 issues in your community. That is why I think computers have a positive affect on society because it gives information it has lots of games and music, and it talks about important issues.	5	4	9
1619	1	Dear @LOCATION1 news paper I have over heard this debate on weather computers are good influinces on people or not. I am sending you this message to state my opinion on the matter and in my opinion I think the computer has very good efects on people. Not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments. There are many reasons why it has a good effect on people but the first and maybe one of the most important is it is an amaizing learning tool. When people are on the internet they could learn just about anything they want to on the giant mass of information we call the internet. It not only dose this but people learn how to do things through simulators from flying a plane to driveing a car. There is even more learning ability on the internet because a lot of people get home schooled on it through the internet and this @MONTH1 be an important part of their education because they might not be able to go to school because they are alway on the road or they move a lot of whatever their reason is. The computer is an important part in the invancement of the people's education. Not only can people use the computer in education but it is used as a tool in many ways, lets say your making a movie and need special effects they will use of photo shop or you need to collect and store changing information like lets say you want to stack you can always or down on a computer. Even if you were a construction worker you could your blue prints with pinpoint accuracy. Another less important thing about the computer is it gives many people entertainment. Lets you come home your bored you have nothing to do play a video game look around on the internet, it is also an important way of getting their music and or videos. This also effects many buissness and if the buissness go under becaus people werent moving ther stuff a lot of jobs will be lost and that is the last thing we need. The government also relies highly on the internet. They need it to make plans, save soldiers, and comunicate with other countries. And last but not the least we have the fitness and wellfare of the people useing computers. All I can really say to that is it is their decision. If they get off they can and if they won to sit there and waste or 	4	5	9
1620	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking if computers benfit society? I believe that computers dont because you cant get exercise if youre always on the computers and @CAPS2's really hard to enjoy nature too. Another reason comuters don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family. hopfully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise? @CAPS2's proven that more than half of united states of @CAPS1 is over weight. Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something use that you know is better wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Interacting with poeple is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don;t then you might learn to be shy and not make as much friends as you like @CAPS2's true taht oyu can make new friends over the computer but @CAPS2's not the some meeting them in person. Also if you do make a ""friends"" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the poeple you like, wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Yes you can play games on the computer but @CAPS2 would be ebtter if you play @CAPS2 with your fmaily. To answer the question everyone is asking I believe that computers don't benefit society at all and hopfully I have encouraged you to believe this too. "	3	4	7
1621	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world."	5	5	10
1635	1	Computers are today a common havar hold item and some people think its bad for socity when in reality its our most useful tool nowadays. It supply's an easy access to information along with preparing skills for future generations. And giving from lifes sometimes to cruel days through gamming.

This improves grades for children and life for adult solving a into the without leving your home and allowing news like yourself to spread into at the moment it's known. It also creates an interactive place for anyone in the world with thing like and or question and answers this allows us not only yo ask opinions and compare responses but to get statistics that @MONTH1 help us make life altering decions. Not only it supply info it also prepare our for the world. With things like children around the world and I social and decion making skills. It also them like web and design as well as simplier things like management and tougher things like business. Along with all that though it gives love an copy. Online video gaming is today a huge maker in which allows people not only for new as they do anything from dance, build, fight, smithe teilor, and so. And this infact @NUM1 of games are ages @NUM2.

1648	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer-time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer-time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself."	6	5	11
1652	1	Dear local news paper, @CAPS1 computers is a good idea because every developed country uses computers. Also they @CAPS2 learning, fertileze comunication, and are comercialy implortant. Computors also make life easier for many people. Computers @CAPS2 learning by let vast of information being available. I personaly find out about many world events just by bringing up yahoo.com. Computers alow me to learn about new @NUM1, learning about cultures all over the world can be done by computers. The last way computers @CAPS2 learning is by informing us about everyday thing like to get a stain out, how to pronounce a word, how to make a new dish, and much more. Computers are also crucial to communictaion. We use computers to talk to our freinds on facebook. You can also meet new people useing a pc. Everyone uses computer so you can basicly meet enyone. The last reason computers are important is for the commercial stand point computer help alot of small bussness out by letting than be known. Domestic seller and huge companies can compette for the same customer. Furthermore the internet generates alot money for people becausethey can use it as a cyber billboard. In conclusion the computer is usefull because of learning, communication, and comercial. Therefore the computer should be supported and not looked down upon.	4	4	8
1678	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2: The effects computers have on people are bad because they are getting too addicted, the computers is a dangerous site to go on, and their brain is smarter then the @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, they are getting too addicting because computers @MONTH1 have a benefit of you being able to serf the internet but you'll get hooked on it too much. For example, youtube is an internet siting that about @NUM1 people go on and barely get off. The people don't turn off their computers to just go get some exercise but just sit there staring at the @CAPS5 and messing up their eyesite. These people need to learn have the will power to get off the @CAPS5. Second, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on because some people in the @LOCATION1 give somebody their @CAPS3 on the @CAPS5 to somebody they don't know about. Almost @PERCENT2 of teens get kidnapped because od giving their @CAPS3 a way to stranger and @PERCENT3 of those teens don't get found. The @CAPS5 is also a place of where a child or teen @MONTH1 get cyber bullied. Cyberbullying is harrassing children or teens on the internet, when children under or over @NUM2 get cyberbullied they sometimes suffer through a deppression and don't tell their parents about it. Six months ago at my old @CAPS4, there was a volunteer at my @CAPS4 talking about cyberbullying and how he got so depressed because of the harrassment, that he commited suicide. The @CAPS5 is not always a safe place to be on. Finally, your brain more smarter than the @CAPS5.People can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on the their computers because your brains are like computers. About @PERCENT1 of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life. The brain is like a @CAPS5 because you can store information and nobody can hack into it. So therefore, computers have bad effects on people because they are getting to addicting, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on, and your brain is smarter than tha @CAPS5.	4	4	8
1682	1	"Many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them. But are they are bad for individuals to use as people say they are. In this instance, a moderation would be helpful. When you think of computers, what comes to mind. Games? Social @CAPS1? What if computers are doing more than that? Last year, a computer helped diagnose a concussion of mine and helped figure out I've had @NUM1 others. Not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human. An expert says ""Computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, @PERCENT1 better than doctors."" @CAPS2 the social netwowrking has a positive aspect. This has let people, who haven't seen each other for a long time, reconnect and become good friends again. With the positive aspects there is always a negative. Computer have started to make kids obese. This is problem in the country because if we become lazy then we could ruin our country. In addition, if we become has reliant of computers @NUM2 diagnos, what happens when they get faulty? These are problems that are very real and aren't being with. If we cant deal with these problems first then computers will turn out to be a bad thing. Lastly, a moderation could be extremely helpful for us today. For example, instead of using social @CAPS1 for friends next door, go outside and play wiffle ball with them. Social @CAPS1 was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street. @CAPS2, instead of totally reling on computers to diagnose problems, have them and the doctor find out. Doing this will get great results and keep doctors prepared if computers, dont work. These are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone. In conclusion, having no computers wouldn't be a great idea because of how much they help society. Although, being totally dependent on them is a bad idea to because they don't have that much benefit to them."	4	4	8
1710	1	Wouldn't you agree that computers have a great affect on people. The three reason why they have a good affect on people is because, it gives you good typing skills, its educational, and it helps you out with alot of things. The first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills. If you have a computer you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good. Each time you use the computer your hands ajust to the keys on the computer. Say if there is someone that wants to work with computers when they get older, well if they practice their typing on their computers at home they will be eligible for the job working with computers. Also computers could be good for the hearing impared. If the hearing impared use to the computers then they can get a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 and chat with people online. This would be useful to them because since they could not hear what people say they can read what people say through the internet. Another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational. In my opinion, computers are very educational because there are alot of websites that teach you facts about different places. For example, what food people eat in different countrys, or where that country is. A website that is the best for finding out accurate facts is www.Ask.com. Ask.com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds. Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites. The last reason why computers have a affect on people is because they help you with alot of things. They help you with alot of things because if you want to know how far @LOCATION2 is from @LOCATION1 then you can go on your pc and find out, or say that you lost the directions to your friends house and your on your way to their house if you brought your labtop you can go on the labtap and find where her house is from your labtop. I know your probably thinking there is such thing as a gps, well if you think about it gps's can be confusing, but your computer reads it out to you. Know your probably saying in your heads why don't you text/call @CAPS3/@CAPS4 if you think about it what if your friend does not talk clearly. In conclusion, wouldn't you agree that computers do have good effects on people. My three arguments are, they help your typing skill educational. They help you with things. please take my ideas into consideration.	4	5	9
1736	1	@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one @ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a @ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First @ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students' handwriting. I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think computers @MONTH1 cost too much, but you @CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I know that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree.	6	5	11
1749	1	Dear newspaper, I think that computers are great for researching things like for a car or sereach for people places and thing. @ORGANIZATION1 are great because you keep in touch with you family and friends. Like you can email them webcam chat and you can instant message them.I think a lot of people should get into @ORGANIZATION1 because you can do everything on them. You can save you picture, download music, play games. People say that some people spend to much time on the @ORGANIZATION1 well i think they should because they should learn new and different things about different countrys city or even states. I don't think there is noting wrong about spending time on a @ORGANIZATION1.	3	3	6
1761	1	"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are very helpful in daily activities, but computers have a bad side. Some users are addicted to their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, they are away from friends and family, and they are not exersizing it if fun to use the @CAPS4 but you should not use it too much! Some people are almost addicted to their @CAPS4. I cant blame them they can charge their ipod, tweet, listen to music, palying games and much more all at the same time! computers are great, but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of activities. People almost feel (some do) that they HAVE to go on facebook to harvest their crops in farmtown, or control their @LOCATION1 on @CAPS3. They get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities. It shouldn't  that for but its became an epidemic, eveybody is being sucked into their computers! People who are on their @CAPS4 @NUM1 are away from their friends and family! they are like oh i haven't talked   his surgery i wonder how he is! Lets see! They go on and  You can talk to someone in just a click! Talking to someone  facebook or twitter is no the same as talking to them in person! Its like people think computers is     @CAPS4 take people away from their friends and family and them talk only on facebook  .When people on the @CAPS4 they become lazy! A person who is @CAPS4 addict will say "" @CAPS5 supposed to go to they gym but let me check my twitter first!"" two hours later then they go the gym! People don't exercise as often as the should! When people are going to lay on the @CAPS4 for @NUM2 minutes it takes @NUM3 hours! They have to sign in, chat with their friends, check their mail look at their tweets look at their restaurnat  check out videos on youtuve and do all other kinds of things! Computers are good but have sideeffects getting addicted, being away from friends and family, and not exercising. @CAPS4 addicts should minimize their time on the @CAPS4!"	4	4	8
2983	2	A lot of @CAPS3 today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and Magazines. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and my views on the censorship of @CAPS3. Here's my idea to fix the problem.      I understand that books and other material @MONTH1 offend certain people, but it might not offend others. Thats why I think @CAPS3 should have a room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be seperate rooms for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content.      This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain @CAPS1 to enter the 'bad content' room. I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 could be @NUM1 years of @CAPS1 to enter the room. That seems fair enough. Your old enough to be able to handle the content.      I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not.      Seperate rooms, @CAPS1 limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very affective. I hope to start seeing that in the future	4	3	4
2990	2	A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax.  Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there.  Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship.  Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.       First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted.  If they offend you then do not read them.  It is as simple as that.  Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs.  A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series.  @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs.  Therefore those people boycott the series.     I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released.  While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing.  Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party.  They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong.  I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book!       Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content.  For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person.  Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards.     Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true.  If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library.  Although there could be a way to compromise.  If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides.       In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children.  When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read.  While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read.  Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes.  Books are a gateway to another world.  Why take that magic away from children	5	4	5
3007	2	I don't believe that certain books, music, magzines, or movies should be removed. If they are found offensive then that is not my problem. If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with. When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves.     No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. If a book id found offensive by one person or group of people that doesnt mean it should be removed off of the shelves. That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with.      Anything and everything is educational in it's own way. Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right. That being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves? It depends on a persons personal views or beliefs. Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that.     It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. It's just easier to live with it. Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. It depends on what you take offence to. Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. It's all based on how you take what they said into thought. So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves. For if one thing must be removed then youi might as well remove everything.	3	3	3
3008	2	I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive.  If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.  Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in.     I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school.  The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.  Even teachers were reading it.  The school board did not even care though.  I think that was completely handled the wrong way.  They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it.  If it offended her, then she should not read it.     Music is an outlet for many people.  They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing.  Without music, there would not be any fun in the world.  People are alwasy listening to music.  When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc.  If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.     Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time.  That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian.  We want to good guys to win.  The movie makes fun of the bad guys.  Somebody is always going to get hurt.     When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else.  I think of how the artist feels.  Why they wrote it that certain way.  If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first.  Then if I like it, I start singing it.  If I do not like it, then I just change the song.     I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended.  We need the different opinions in life.  If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway.  I do not want to be the same as everybody else.  I love my personality.  I am different and kind of an outcast.  But I am true to myself.  And I respect other people's opinions.  I wish everyone would do the same.  Or at least try to do the same.  Thank you for listening to what I had to say	4	4	4
3009	2	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in.  There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual.  Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for.       Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in.  People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community.  I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it.  People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies.  Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in.  The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended.  There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something.     Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for.  People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal?  Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is.	3	4	3
3016	2	One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right no one would be able to express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves.      What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the secton that they belong. Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section. beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdrawl the book.     The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries	3	3	3
3031	2	Every library has tons of information on just about everything.  There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information.  There is even some information that some people might take offence to.  On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it.  I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.     The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries.  Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race.  Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about.  Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race.  This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.     Libraries have all kinds of information.  I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain.  Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know	3	2	3
3048	2	I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from. Some books @MONTH1 seem bad, but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine.     Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1. On many occations he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth. He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book.      When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning.      After several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it. He figured that one would not hurt. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time. He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried.     He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read. The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had know other way home than to drive. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk. When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time. A semi hit him in the left side of his car.       After thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party. He was grounded for two months. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well.     Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf. The story in wach book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in a real life situations. I know that books help me figure out many things. Even what to do and what not to do. If you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read	3	3	3
3055	2	If you were offinded by a book in the library would you want it took off the shelf? I wouldn't there is no point in removing it there are a lot of books that offend people, that one book isn't just towards you the same goes for movies and music.      Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people. Some people @MONTH1 not find the same thing offending like you do everyone dont think alike. If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today. This is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out.          Movies are anoter way of getting you emotions or expressing yourself. People find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it. We are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies. No one or no race is the center of attetion in movies people @MONTH1 feel as if they are but thats a personal thing people @MONTH1 go through.     Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people. Music @MONTH1 be found most offending now days but, music is also away of getting emotions and freedom of speech out. I've never felt offended because of a song i've heard or anything people are going to say what they feel and want.     Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world people either gotta het used to it or stay offended. Books,music,movies, or magazines wont be pulled because of emotions. I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things	3	3	3
3061	2	Dear Katherine Paterson,         Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive? I honestly don't think that's nessecary because not everybody @MONTH1 find those materials offensive. If a couple people think that a certain book or something is offensive then dont read it or pay attention to it, don't take something from someone that they like.     I think that if  there was people that found a certain topic interesting and there was also people who found it offensive, that they should keep the material and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it. Either way I think that they shouldn't remove those materials, enless everyone agrees that it's offensive.That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic, just because one person found it offensive. Now if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that then maybe that can be considered being removed, but other than that I see no reason why you should take away something that some people @MONTH1 enjoy. Let's say I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food. Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else. That's just there opinion on things and you can't always get what you want, so just deal with it.      Well those are my thoughts on rather or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive. My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you don't read it or have anything to do with it. Other than that you shouldn't take materials away from people enless everyone agrees on it.                                                   Sincerly,                                                          @PERSON2	3	3	3
3067	2	How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material. Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf.         Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't? Library's shouldn't have that accessable. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf. Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not.         Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it. Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach.         Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't. Thoes that can't, it @MONTH1 reflect something negative on them and it @MONTH1 cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys.     In @CAPS1, librarys should not supply offinsive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them. If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of @NUM1 can enter. If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.	4	3	4
3086	2	Yes, I think that some books should be taken out of all libraries. No little kid should be looking at or saying those things. Some of the books could offend some people when they don't know it.      Parents need to watch what there kids read and watch on a daily basis. Kids need to know why they shouldn't watch those shows or read those books. Maybe if parents would watch there kids they would mind better than what they do.      Some of the books could offend people when they don't know it. No little kid should be looking at or reading those books or movies. That is why i think those books should be taken out of all libraries	2	3	2
3091	2	The way that the books, musics ,ect. are made for people basicly for that age group. Like if that particular book contains profanity that some find offensive, then they should ignore that book and move on to the other book that is more fitting for that person rather than starting a controversy over that just of one book. Some stuff will have lables on them like parental guidence to show that only particular age person can have. From my experience is that it's ok, but if it gets out of hand then I just leave it and go to the next thing. Although rmoving the books from most people might not help alot because some people would like to have that book that they won't find anywhere else. The librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library and have the kids book in the younger section of the library. So hopefully this might help the problem that you might have for people to enjoy that books, music, magazine, ect.	2	2	2
3092	2	Do you think there should be any books movies madaines etc tooken off the shelfs? Will if so then you should read my newspapper actle.     I don't think that there is any books etc, that i would take off the shelfs. There are many books etc that kids should read, but you can tell your kids not to read them, or if they do start to read them take the book away from them.      There are some books that kids shouldn't read, but only you can stop them from reading them. They willl always try to find away to get what they want. so taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good, because they'll find the book movie ets somehow. The only way to make such is to keep your kids over watch, and to make such they do son't the stuff you don't want them to do.         In conculusion taking books off the shlef would't help anyone out, but just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you  don't want them to be around	3	2	3
3109	2	Katherine Paterson stated this quote, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' @CAPS1 I agree . I feel that some of the books we have in our @ORGANIZATION1 libraries today just shouldn't be there. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give  students and young children the wrong impact on life or their envoirment around them.     Now days, what children see is sometime what they do, so if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it. @CAPS2 observation when i look at kids  in @CAPS2 community playing  is that they follow one another . When their playing tag and hide an go seek , So movies, books , music, and magazines play a big part on the way they behave.     @CAPS2 own experience with offensive books would be, there are books that are made by @PERSON3. In these books they use curel language, use wonmen bodyparts as symbols and many more rude things. @CAPS2 little sister came across one of these books, when she ask me about it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading, So the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book. For her to get any images out of her head that I felt she shound't have.     Another experience I've saw was with @CAPS2 little cousin @PERSON2. He was looking at a magazine out of @ORGANIZATION1 library. The magazine was offensive to wonmen. It was a play boy bunny magazine. Now I don't know if you ever heard of these magazine , but I think it is very wrong that they use wonmen bodys for men to view . I also feel that  those type of magazines should not be in a @ORGANIZATION1 library. I believe it gives children, mainly  young men the wrong thoughts about wonmen.     @CAPS2 overall thoughts on censorship in libraries, is that not eveyone is going to feel the same way I do . There are parents that allow their children to read, listen , and watch whatever they want. I'm here to say i don't feel that is the way to go about things , because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things . I hope you take with you, @CAPS2 personal experience with you and help you children read , listen , and watch age appropriate books , music , moives , and magazines	3	3	3
3115	2	There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed.       Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done.     Some people find some offensive subjects interesting. For example, if someone found the @PERSON1 interesting they @MONTH1 want to just do some research to learn more about it. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects.     There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive. If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job.      I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removings books, magazines, music, etc. I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else	4	4	4
3131	2	Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it?     Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things.     Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent.      Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libaries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child.	4	4	4
3144	2	Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. Although censorship isnt usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over-used. Not everyone has the same views and morals, what @MONTH1 be considered appropriate for some people , @MONTH1 be viewed differently by other cultures or religions.       In my personal opinion if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it etc. Obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience. No one is forceing people to read or watch things, that is why there is something called viewers disgression. If everything that was considered offesive to a certain individual or group where censored , there would be no @LOCATION1. In @LOCATION1, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose. To censor things out is condraticary to that amendmant.    For example the censorship of useing the word '@CAPS1' in vain on television. I myself find this to be excessive because it doesnt apply to my beliefs . Although the program ' The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' protrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs. Even though I find this offensive and sterotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it.     I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television. Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for a one's children to be subjected to it,that is blowing censorship out of proportion. If you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it.	4	4	4
3146	2	Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion no I don't think that any books should be banned from a public libaray.     The authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books @MONTH1 offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines. I think that if certain books get banned from the libaray then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will banned them as well.     In my personal opinion no I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library. The reason being is because you can't judge a book by it's cover. You don't know if the book is goin to offend you until you read it. After you read it or you'r in the middle of reading it and it offends you you should take it back to the library and get a new one.     Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion no I don't think that books should be banned from the public library. Because alot of books that do offend people are the one's that teach us about history.	3	3	3
3170	2	I dont think we should not take books, Music, Movies, and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us. If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me.     Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like. One of them is @CAPS1 Books I hate them with all of my heart. The next kind of books that I think is offensive is @CAPS2 Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read. So I think that it is a wast of paper. The last kind of books I think is offensive is @CAPS3 Books because they are hard to read them in @CAPS3.     Their are lot's of music out there I dont like. One of them is @CAPS5. I dont know why I dislike @CAPS5 but I do. The next type @CAPS6- @CAPS7. The singer in todays @CAPS6- @CAPS7 I think are no good. The last type of music is some of todays rap. I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words.     Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like. The first one is @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I did not get the hole plut of that movie. The next one @CAPS12 of the corn. Their was no way I could find out way the @CAPS12 was killing the people over @NUM1 in that town. The last movie that I did not like was ALL the @CAPS13 movies. I just did not like them ok?     I think all of these things are offensive. But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away. There are thing people like but I dont like them. Their things that my friend like but I dont like. Their thing I like and they dont like. But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like. But you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world	3	3	3
3188	2	I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @NUM1 to @NUM2, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of.          When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life.                So thats what my person input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.	3	3	3
3204	2	Dear newspaper and staff,               @CAPS1 has came to my attention that @CAPS1 is being considered that most libraries in the community @MONTH1 have a removal and or censorship of some books in the libary. I find this not accepable; in my opinion this is a attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offenisve reading material from futher generations. For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labled ' A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1', this book describes a childs heartships and the abuse he takes on a daily basics. Books of this sort are not only imformitive @CAPS1 also gives the reader an open mind on how things might have been. Some topics @MONTH1 include; slavery, abuse, war, and discrimation.                These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society. Censoring and removal of these book are pointless; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue. @CAPS1 is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships, problems, and lessons in which these topics araised. Without imforming our generations of these issues @CAPS1 could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent!          My opinion on movies however are a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material. Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that @MONTH1 be offesive or perhaps discrimating. They @MONTH1 also need adult combinations to preview the movie.           So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues. I just fully believe open @ORGANIZATION1 content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed. I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks!                                              Sincerly,                                                                                     @PERSON1- @ORGANIZATION1	3	3	3
3213	2	I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves. No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them. Some people @MONTH1 think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed twards them. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine.     Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from. Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say.     Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they @MONTH1 never find it.       Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because thats @PERSON2's favorite color. Its not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested.      You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things. It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life. So why not take the risk? It could even help you.	4	3	4
3216	2	Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the oppurtunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music all for free and for a certain period of time.  When people grow up, they tend to start reading, watching, and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to.  Since books are read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books should not be taken from the shelves and only very bad movies and music should leave the library.     Books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world.  Normally when people read a book, they don't read it in a group unless they are in a reading group discussing certain books.  If someone wanted to read a book that was innappropriate for their children, let them do it; it's not hurting the children that they have been reading innappropriate topics, it will only hurt them if that child finds the book that should have been hidden in a better place.  For example, @PERSON1 read the book 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', which had some innappropriate content for a child in there, but not so bad that it would be heinous.  @PERSON1 will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children; this scenario is how it should be.  Although, if a library is putting adult books near children's books, they need to redesign to keep kids from accidentally walking into the adult section.  Books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough, but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner.     Movies and music are a great way to kick back and relax after a long day, unless your kids are around.  Keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task, whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall.  Music can of course be listened to through headphones, but what happens when you leave a @CAPS3 is left in the car and a child is sent in that car to wait for his parents to get in?  The parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away.  The movies and music were from the library, a place where the child thinks that there would never be something such disgraceful material as what their parents are watching and listening to, ruining their good thoughts of the library.  Libraries need to either get rid of all nasty content pertaining to movies and music or if their main business is that and can't seem to give it up, just put the content as far away as possible from the children.     As said above, libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds.  Libraries are a place where kids can have fun picking out whatever book they wish to read, not a place where parents can pick up items that might spoil that child's brain	4	3	4
3217	2	Whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library. The critialzing of books and materials that are neatly stacked in the shelves, are taken and miss treated from the harsh people that think they are offensive. In my point of view, I strongly agree that there is no right to argue about what should or should not be removed in the libraries.      The reflecting of my own views along with the libraries, shows intertest in the materials for people all over the world. The reason that I, myself, do not believe in this situation is how it mentioned in Katherine Paterson's passage. It explained, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 everybody around has a unique part about themselves, and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have. This leads into taking a material or book they see, the wrong way and being offensive about it. However, there might be someone else that does not view that same exact book is wrong, but instead, see's something else that could lead to be offensive to them as well.      To make this observation not as confusing, I will share my own experience that might help focuse more on my argument. There is a time when I went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout, that had an impact on colored people. It described how it would be like, if there was still slavery and that if everybody wasn't taught or treated equal amongst everyone else. In this situation, it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this. Maybe the people are relieved and interested, knowing they are free now. On the other hand however, many colored people might get in an awkward position, having no passion of bringing the equiality up in the present world, or even the future. Many might want to forget about what happened, instead of books and magazines still publishing articles and stories about it. Again, this argument might go both ways, meaning one less book would be off the shelf, or many would be newly stacked aside from the others.     When people think of materials, they most likly think of something that symbolizes an event, time period, or a symbol itself. This could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries. The way people want to take roll in the things they are part of, might actually be found in the library. However, someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown, will remove the material. This tends to make the people that thought it was right, not find the interest they wanted to recieve.     Another arugment people might have is that libraries are a public place, right? Well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings, materials, and movies. People might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out. Not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well. Well, instead of picking and choosing, I think everything should be left alone and people should only go to the section of interest they are looking for and leave the other materials out of their view.     My experience and observations about this argument has covered why I, and all of you, should reflect on the views of censorship the approperiate way in libraries. Not saying this will control all the problems, but it will help from removing all of materials that could have a big roll in future process of taching children, teachers, and of course, each and everyone	4	4	4
3227	2	Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. Library now days have alot of offensive language in there books so if someone were to take all of the book like that out of the library then library wouldn't even have that many books in it. Music is the same way all music now days might have some offensve words in them thats just something people now days have to get over.          I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parent might not like the idea of there librarys haveing offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If the parent don't want there children to not read those book then they need to chose there childrens book, but I think takeing all the offensive book of the shelves isn't very smart. Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.           Some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in then like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road. So if you take those books off the shelves and werent able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things. They really wouldnt know the side effects and bad thing that could come out of those things. Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in then and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice word in them.I know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.     If there are book you dont want youself to read then don't read them. I think it would be unfair to take everthing that have some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read. Its not fair to people who @MONTH1 enjoy those books to not have the luxary to read those book anymore cause a few parent got mad about a book. Some of the old books have alot of racism in them, and you actually @MONTH1 read some of them in a school for a class. Those book @MONTH1 also have bad language in them to. Take thing those books away from us @MONTH1 take away are education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should.          So i think that censorshipn in library is just a horrible idea. It can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life	3	4	3
3234	2	A library is a place to go when inneed of solitude and peace with researching or reading. There is no reason other than someones opion to why certain materails should be removed from libraries. We the people have a right to read what others have composed thourgh their thoughts and ideas.      Certain materail @MONTH1 be offensive to different people, but to the others that could use that materail for research or for pleasure reading, would not be fair. If certain materials were removed because of someones action to there personal or religious opion, then those materials would nopt be avalible for those that would need to posess that information.     Did anyone think when they asked for the certain offensive materail to be removed? If people did they would relize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort to get that infomation out to the world. How do you think that author would feel? You just had their best work pulled from the shelfs because you think it is offensive. How would you feel if some to your best peice of writing and complained that libraries cannot put this on their shelfs because its offensive.     There has been certain matierals I have listen to or read tht I thought could be offensive to certain people, but that is the media that writes the society as we read it. Some of those people @MONTH1 have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things. Maybe not even watch certain materials but others, that might be there part of livlyhood.     We can't just take materials off the shelfs of libraries. That material is the life blood of our society. If you cut the blood flow, bad things are bound to happen after that. For whoever reads this, remember what we produces as media is who we are, what we do , and what we live for.	3	4	3
3240	2	what i think about all of this? Is that to me i really don't care because that is like who i am. And its up the parents if they want the to remove the books off the shelf if they believe that a certain material as book, music, movies, and magazing should be remove off the shelves. Also i dont think a book will ever really hurt anyone. I mean its just a book it dose not really matter.     Next, i am saying this becuse i dont really would get offensive to stuff like this argument. And also if there some stuff that kids shouldnt know about then they should  put those stuff in the adult section and not a place where they can find it easy. They shouldn't put stuff that you think children should never know about in the kids section.     Matter of fats i don't know why they should  remove stuff like movie. Becuse if they are trying to block them form kids to see they are really dumb to do that. Beause there are moive that children can watch. And some parents is not going to let their children watch a @CAPS1 @NUM1 movies, and other movie they were not to see at there ages. Unless if their parents allowe it.And that goes with the same with the music. I don't know if they have bad music in the library.I don't see rap stuff in the library.like raps @CAPS2 and other stuff like it.So this is my thought about this arguments	2	2	2
3248	2	No, I don't think books are offensive in librarys. Movies are a different kind of story if you child is under the age of eighteen they should not be renting a rated @CAPS1 movie, unless their parent approves of it.      This is one reason why our public library should not have rated @CAPS1 movies. While i was in our public library one afternoon I was looking at the movie selection, i was tring to decide which movie to chose. There was a little boy, at the age of nine or ten it looked liked to me, but he had two movies in his hand. They looked really good it was an action type movie, so i asked the boy if i could see the movie really fast. He asid yes, so i grabbed it from him and looked at the rating because from the title picture it looked gory. I noticed it was a rated @CAPS1 movie, and i told the boy did u know this is a rated @CAPS1 movie and he said yes, I was surprised his parents would let him watch movies like that, if i was his age i would never been able to.      My second reason why our public library should get rid of any kind of swimsuit magazines like @CAPS5 and/or @CAPS6 magazines. I was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like @CAPS5,swimsuit magazines and many more. Do you think your children should not have seen any kind of magazines like that in our libray for the public to see. If a little girl went to the magazine rack and saw that magazine, she would either want to look at it or act like she not even noticed it. At her age she wants someone to look up to and if she sees a model on or in the magazine she would want to possibly look like her, so this is how eatting disorders start. This is the  reason why library's should get rid of any kind of magazines under that catagory.     These are the reason why I think our local library should get rid of rated @CAPS1 movies and/or Magazines like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. If you agree with me contact your libray and tell them what i have told you today. @MONTH1 we put a stop to censorship in our librarys.	4	3	4
3262	2	How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen somthing that you think no other kid should see? Im going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries. After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace.      Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happends and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn?      The books that children read varys. The younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read @MONTH1 have words in it to display a seriouse part to the story, or a tragic monment in the characters life. Some @MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it.       Authers usally vary their vocabulay in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the @DATE1's why would they try and clean up the grammer that was spoken from that time. Try and change what the reader might think about that time.      Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear someing oddensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in	4	4	4
3265	2	A very wise man in @CAPS1 life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him. @CAPS4 went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a @CAPS2, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As @CAPS4 grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. @CAPS4 had no example of how to behave, yet @CAPS4 stayed away from @CAPS3, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography.      As I have been growing up with @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a hard working individual and having @CAPS1 mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, @CAPS1 parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' @CAPS4 had a valid point. In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers.      What has the world come to when a child of age eight @MONTH1 walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and @CAPS5 have the book there at all.      Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered. Well what if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD @CAPS5 have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is @CAPS5 the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest asured that their child is safe from the filth of inmoral things	4	5	4
3268	2	Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right? To read them well thats what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf.      I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves. Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and @MONTH1 offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience.     Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening.     So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things.     This is why I think books that offend some people should't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf. Just as they are today in our local library	3	3	3
3280	2	Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In todays world it is hard to please every living soul. Every one is going to disagree about something in there life time.      Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or to. People @MONTH1 interpride it different than others. Therefore I personally dont think they should take articules out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornograh then they should deffently take it out.     My conclusion is that you cant please everybody. I think that you shouln't take things out of the library that can help a student learn.	3	3	3
3289	2	In my opinion i don't really think certain items should be romoved from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests. At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, beacuse they could not appropriate for childrern. If we removed cerain items from the library people would get mad.      I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can aslo make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area. If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming. In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens smaller amounts of people will come.      In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people  have many interesting in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people. Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to provent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said many people have many intersts in many things and they deservie to enjoy them in the library.	3	2	3
3292	2	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries. Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another. I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored.      An idea that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensice to the other, and vice versa. Someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion @MONTH1 believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs. In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that. Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves. If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left. Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions. The @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offensive to someone of @CAPS2 religion, and because of that the @CAPS1 would not be able to be sold. If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it. Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another.     If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall. When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us. If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended. Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves. I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere. If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors @MONTH1 say forget it and not even right anymore. It is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone. Also, attraction to literature would seize. People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested. Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored.     If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same. Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education. Some teenagers including me @MONTH1 find some of the material they read-even in school-to be offensive or have a touchy subject. I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future. These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read. Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book. The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored.     A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life. An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist. One book that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same. For all of these reasons, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.	4	4	4
3301	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,      @CAPS3, my name is @PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to there own opinion. People @MONTH1 not want there kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them were there kids cant find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies, books, and music that childreen listen to, watch, or read.     I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything. Adults @MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv. But, if there kids wanna learn about things that happen thats not the greatest, then people should let them.     It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen. Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way.     I'm sure many people @MONTH1 not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way.     Sincerely,      @PERSON1	3	3	3
3326	2	I believe that indeed certian books sould not be on libraries shelves. And some people @MONTH1 feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem. I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them. I personally know parents that would not allow their childern to need a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it rediculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they dont take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it.      I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocost and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a postition and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or atleast moved to a different part of the library. Do not force your thoughts on some one else	3	3	3
3327	2	BOOKSDear @PERSON1,@CAPS1 @CAPS2 staring to tell you about the books in the libraries that some adults find offensive so for the kids. These books should be taken away so kids won't read them, second part is adults should protest so the libraries could get does maganzines away or etc, and my last thing is @CAPS4 do libraries get these books and let kids take them so they could read them.The first example @CAPS2 giving is I founded some books and other things that I search being offensive for kids. And the libraries letting kids read them without an I.D because they are for adults reading sections. These books need to be away so kids won't read offensive things or trying to them. They should pbs books so under age children could read and so parents don't have to be worry about there kids what they are reading in there free time.The second example is parents should protest so books or other etc things could be rid of. Parents need to protest so any thing they find offensive should get off of the shelve. Or another thing is they will have to make a list of what books are offensive and let only adults read them by having an I.D and could sound a little better so books or etc don't get rid of the books.The last example is @CAPS4 do libraries let kids take them home and read them.They should what kids need to read like educational books for school or for other things. Adults need to see what there kids read this days. Kids need to understand what books are good for them from there age and otherwise their brain will start confusing them at their age.The conclusion is that libraries need to make something up so children don't read these kind of books that the only thing will do is mess up with there brain and then there parents will need to pay so their children could take therapy and others kids so their brain could be better. So please libraries do something so parents don't need to worry about what there kids read these days. Like for me I won't like my kid read offensive things because they will start doin the same things so libraries do something about these on offensive things.	3	3	3
3342	2	Libraries provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and peace. You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper. You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them. Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get away. But, heres the truth. Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shevles. So, do we remove these things or let them stay?     My opinion is to let them stay. I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they @MONTH1 contain a few vulgar words or images. It's the same with magazines and movies. Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music. Just because one person my find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will.     People have many different views when it comes to these things. Take history for example. Many history books contain harsh, real life facts about things that went on in the past. A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended. Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it. Another good example is movies. Some people @MONTH1 find a movie offensive because of words said or if a certain person dies first, while others could care less.      Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else. There are many movies nowdays that can be seen as very offensive. But honestly, the offensive things happening @MONTH1 just make someone else want to know more about what's going on. It is practically the same with books. I myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted. Even though in the end, I lfind them to be exceptionally books. It just on how you view it.     So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library? The answer is no. There are just too many things that can be taken offensively. If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant. Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting. You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world. There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non-offensive book could even be found. My advise to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who @MONTH1 react strongly. Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what they're dealing with	4	4	4
3351	2	When it comes to censorship I believe that very few things should be removed. Just because it is found offensive by some does not mean it is offensive to all. A material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people. If you find it offensive just ignore it you don't have to buy it. Maybe somebody else finds it interesting and it comtains the information that they have been seeking.     When it comes to books, music, movies or magazines I believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. Other than that a little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but it should probably be kept from small children if it's to bad. Usually if a child is exposed to that type of material they usually grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completly acceptable. Sometimes it's violence sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case @MONTH1 be.      Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals. But my belief is that if your a good parent then shouldn't have to worry about that type of stuff. If you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such. For example if you don't want your child watching a certain television show then block it. Don't just think they won't watch it and then when they do you get mad at the people who created the show. It's not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material.     There are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed. But what I believe is that this is @LOCATION1 and people can read and write whatever they want, and if you have something to say about it then that's fine by me you can believe whatever you would like to believe. People should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people	4	4	4
3359	2	I think that if u feel like they are sayin bad thing that you should not read the books or magazines and dont lisen to the music and dont look at the moves.          If you feel offensive about it just dont look at it because a porson might not find it offensive.It is port of life to look at something offensive so why do it now. I think that if they do that they might just take some @CAPS1.Vs shows off the air becuas there are a lot off shows out there that are offensive and some do not like that but they dont take it off the air so why take books music, movies, and magazines off the shelves.    i dont believe that they should do that at all becuas if i dont like it i dont look at it so i dont get mad at something somebody say bout my believe.    A porson might not like the same music u like i might not like the same music he or she likes but i dont wont to take it off the shelves they should just stop lookin and lisning to all this stuff a porson says about there believe.	2	2	2
3362	2	Dear @CAPS1:     Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.      As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to relect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials. If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library.       Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer.       As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible. Please consider the following.      Kind regards,         @PERSON2	4	4	4
3379	2	Dear @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @MONTH1 concerm;             I'm writing you to explain that @MONTH1 students are tired of students in their school not returning books to their schoollibrary. Many students have report due on a book that a fellow classmate didn't return. Many students either forget they have a book out or even past due. So it makes it hard upon the student who is trying to do a report. If the books, music, magazines and etc., are not return people should have to be punished more than just having to pay a overdue fee.     I have witnesses alot of students who didn't either want to turn in the book thr checked out. We the junior class at my high school had a term paper that we need books, newspaper, internet and magazines. Lucky, The senior class turned in all of their book, newspaper, internet, magazines and etc., that they used on their term papers, we the junior class were able to sucess on our term paper. But many juniors still havent reutrn the materials they have used.The teachers have threqten them with overdue fees and or have to pay for the losted material. I see that having to pay an overdue fee and or have to pay for the losted materials doesn't bother them.      Even though teachers makes them pay the future classes will have to struggle and go out and purchase books, magazines, and etc., The classes that have to take @CAPS4 @NUM1 next year and do their term paper @MONTH1 not be able to sucess. It is unfair they have to worry will have the materials they need for them to sucess and do their term paper.      I think if the schools took time out and got parnets involed. They would n't have as many students would didn't follow rules. students think that their teachers can't tell them what to so maybe if their parnets were involes they would follow directions and turn in their books, magazines and etc.,     In conclusion, If someone wants to take a book they should get alot of their personal infornmation as well as their school name.If people dont return their books their want be any thing left for other people to use.So i say everybody do have the right to use the books, music, movies magazine and etc. to their adventage. Just try to remember to return them for other students as well.	1	2	1
3391	2	'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magizine's and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelfing units?     Magazine's are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are @DATE1 of age. Library's will most often place the magazine's on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers. Most of  the content of the magazine's are pictures of half dressed women or men and explict lanuage on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so.     I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better @DATE1 sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing @CAPS2.V. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems ardous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the magestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn'@CAPS2 right. It shouldn'@CAPS2 even be allowed.     With electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 know half the songs that the children buy, expecially when they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 buy it at home. With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive lanuage or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can'@CAPS2. And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the avaliablity of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the aweful lanuage all together in songs. Because the lanuage that they use is not needed.     Although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul lanuage is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explict lanuage and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea. It might just start a revolution	4	4	4
3393	2	Should certain materials be removed from your public library? Not everyone has the same views as eachother. What might be offenses to you, @MONTH1 be enjoyable to someone else.      I personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library, just because something you might not like someone could really enjoy. If you don't want to learn about something you shouldn't take that away from others who do.      I think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to. Even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely.      More and more books are banned everyday, and I personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who don't get to enjoy the things the old generation have.      So I believe that no books should be removed from library's. If you don't believe or enjoy something doesn't mean someone else wont	3	3	3
3396	2	First of all, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazined, etc, should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive, thats question should not be ask ever in life.      Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1. or @CAPS2. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     In my conclusion, about this article. I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries	3	4	3
3397	2	One person's strong negative opinion effects everyone else.  That doesn't seem logical or fair.  A library is a sanctuary for people to go read their favorite books for free, containing books from all types of genres.  There is a book for everyone in the library; it's a matter of finding it.  Therefore, finding a book offensive or unsuitable does not give one the right to take that privaledge away from everyone else.     Books have a way of putting our mind at ease, whether that's because it's an escape or measured on how enjoyable it is to read.  Books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader; some @MONTH1 even find the books relatable.  For example, if there was a scene that one reader thought was too graphic or horrific for other readers, there @MONTH1 be someone out there who would find this scene enjoyable because they can relate to it.  People who aren't capable of relating to such a scene would only find it as inappropriate and try to remove it from another's reach.  One person's opinion is not of any more importance than the next person's.     The book '@CAPS1' is a professionally written, fictional novel that has been praised for it's quality, hence the numerous awards won.  Although, this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that this woman was succumbed to throughout her life.  Even so, it is still on the list of suggested college level reads for @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 classes.  It is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel, versus the exceptional writing style.  If all readers were able to look past the surface amoung these scenes, less books would be contemplated on shelf removal.  One person's negative interpretation of a novel effects everyone else's right concerning the censorship in libraries.     Readers are fully warned beforhand of the maturity of the contents.  The books are ranked, critiqued, summarized (back cover summary), and even sorted in a library.  If one finds a book offensive, look in a different section.  Books are sorted by genre for that reason as well; different genres apeal to different people.  This applies to the maturity of the reader as well.  Books are sorted according to what appeals to what age.  If you find a book offensive, instead of having it removed from the shelf altogether, look in a section for younger peoples, or a different genre completely.  If someone finds the book offensive, the fault is not of the book being there, but of the person being in the wrong section.     The main problem concerning book censorship in libraries is not the content, but how the interpretations differenciate towards such content.  On this issue, the other readers' opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked.  For one to complain about a book's contents automatically give someone else the right to protect the book's contents.  For libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights @LOCATION1 has stood for	4	4	4
3420	2	Sometimes i think its always good to have an anappropiate material on the shelves of stores or a library. i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy. Or maybe when you been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive be cause it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up.         My views on censorhip contain to keep the offensive materials because its what people like best. Music, magazines, books, and movies. All of these materials can entertain adults, and teenagers because of the anappropiate sayings. It seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act, such as music as the number one offensive material. Music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and starts to feel that anapprpiate vibe.          Another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch. Movies and television. when we watch a movie thats is offensive and that can be very anappropiate, you learn from whats in the movie. Most people make movies that can teach lessons if your willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life. Thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores. Television is basically the same for movies. You can learn a lot from a offensive @CAPS1 show, you can learn what and what not to do.          Also my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials of what we read, books; books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands. People seem to read books because of the catorgories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of peoples lifes, rough, lovely, funny and drama. We attend to read these offensive books because of what some of us been through as a kid or just would like to read it because they wanna maybe feel the same sympothy that some one else @MONTH1 have had. Also books can be adviceful of ehat people want to do in life, careers that you @MONTH1 be intersted in.     last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines. Magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf. I go against the reason of magazines to be on the shelf because its alot of gossip. I believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines. Also because of the false information. The false information that that give, is what we wanna buy. But for the most part of my oppinion, i believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up.     I believe the offensive materials music, movies, books, and some what of magazines should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy. They all catch eyes for gossip, provokinding adds	4	3	4
3430	2	What do you consider an offensive book? Everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive. So how can you justify that a book, magizine, movie, music, etc. should be removed from a shelf due to content. Of course there are the ones that most people would aggree that are offensive to young kids and even some adults but then again other people don't find the same things offensive. The items that do contain graphic content, cursing, etc. and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others. So honestly no one can say that a certain book(s), music, movie(s), magazine(s), etc. do not have a right to have a place on a shelf and should or shouldn't be removed.      If parents dont want there children or teenagers looking or seeing certain material that is something that the parents need to take into their own hands not a library or anywhere else. Now if this is an item at the home of a parent and they dont want their kids to see it they have every write to remove it from the shelf. Then again if their child or teen finds this item and looks at it and the parents didn't want them to they shouldn't have bought it in the first place of they should have removed the item.     So can you as a stranger justify wheather or not somthing is offensive and a parent shouldn't let their kid look at it, or that a library or store shouldn't have that item on the shelf? No you can't. If you don't want you children to see it or if you don't set standards and rules	3	3	3
3435	2	This statment is not right. Peolpe should be alound to read what ever they went or linst to or watch what ever movie they went. When someone read somthing thats bad they @MONTH1 or not like it. So people should not take away books, movies,and music that are bad.      One thing that peolpe should have a choose of what they read and other stuff. Books some people like reading bad stuff beacuse they enjoy it. If the person do not like it they should put back and find somthing else to read. Now movies are a lot of fun to watch. But when you watch a new movie you should rent it first to see if you like the offensive sence or not. And the age thing yay you should watch a movie with andult if your to young. Now music is one thing that is offensive should not be takn off the shelves. Becasue if you dont like it do not pick it up from the shelves and tell people thats bad music when it could be some great music. Ok there is one thing that can be taken off the shevels is the magazines. Its bad for people to be reading those tip of magazines. if they went them they should order them offline mail at their house.      So people should not take off the shelves are books, movies, and music but they can take away magzines.People like the books and stoffe that have bad stofe in them. And there should be no taking off the shevels. Thats what i think of if somone toke somthing off the shelves.	2	3	2
3439	2	I think that most books, magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are ok. Many people needs to read them and see what they are about. I think people take little things such as, curse words, or if the book or magizine is talking about drugs people take offensve.          I don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it. Many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is. I have read many books that have inappropriate words in them.     I had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when I started reading it it had a lot of curse words in it. I guess thats just how it is now a days. You honestly cannot find a book without atleast one bad word in it. People just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials.     I do not think that the books, music, movie, magizines etc. should be removed from the shelves. It could be interesting to someone else but not you. Many people have different oppinions about different kinds of things and I think it should just be left up to that person weather or not they read, listen or even look at certain kind of reading material.	3	3	3
3449	2	Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young reads. Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely. People think that have young people exposed to this offensive material will effect the choices they make, and how they will react in certain situations. At the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves. They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to. Its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not. Its not some elses right to take away choices that aren't theirs.     People who belive that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds. They believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying. This in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader. Which @MONTH1 cause the young reader to be more aggresive or more like to make bad decisions about there well being or the well being of those around them. These people want there libraries to be about learning and be a healthy eviornment were young minds can grow naturaly and unharmed by offensive material.     People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say its no one elses right to make this decison for you by removing them. Its the readers right to choose weather or not to read the material. The read will most likely learn what the material is saying regaurdless of weather it is in the library or not. They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe enviornment then to have some one else later in there life show them or tell them. The enviornment maybe alot more dangerous then a library if learn though some one else.     I believe in both in a way. I believe it is not some one elses right to remove these books from libraries. But i also believe that it should not be avalible for young readers to get. These books maybe be offensive to some people but its there choice to read it. They do not have to read these books it does not affect them. I believe the books not suitable for young readers should be placed on either a higher shelf or in a different part of the library where young readers do not have acsess to. If a readers parents want them to learn about it in a safe enviornment then they should sit there children down and explain it to them themselves. In the end we all have our rights and we use those to choice weather to read or listen to certain material. It is no one elses choice besides your own.	4	4	4
3455	2	Librarys have the right to diside how censored they want their material on their shelves to be. Much of this material @MONTH1 be considered offensive to certain people. However some materials @MONTH1 be as offensive to one perwson, it @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Americans have freedom of speech, and writing, and many ohter rights. A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves.      There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines. Howver, some materials @MONTH1 be found offensive to someone, it @MONTH1 not be found offensive to others. A library @MONTH1 not be able to please everyone. 'But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if somone finds somthing offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves.      A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disterbances. A person probably isnt looking for somthing offensive. Therefore coming accross somthing that is offensive @MONTH1 be disterbing; however they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that persons choice to choose that library to attend to. So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials. If somone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library.     Americans have the right to be free, so does a library. If a person comes across a offinsive piece of material it should be ignored. A library can not please everyone by taking out all of it merchandice that @MONTH1 be considerd offensive. There simply would be nothin left. People should be aware that they @MONTH1 come across some offensive materials when going in to a library, so it will allways be the peoples choice of attending that library	3	4	3
3457	2	In today's world being a child isn'@CAPS1 the easy thing, they have ideas and thoughts racing through our mind constantly, weather it is the stress of school or what there doing this @DATE1. But the last thought a child would have is if the literature their reading is offensive or not. I do not think that cencorship should be enforced more than it already is. Although that parents, and the government would disagree, cencorship is going to do nothing but make out future children more close minded and sheltered than they already are. Children shouldn'@CAPS1 lose their innocence so soon but they shouldn'@CAPS1 be so nieve about the world either. So I'm against censorship, because it's not going to accomplish anything but make children more sheltered.       Censorship is already posted on music and movies, and it's not doing anything children are still goint to listening to music that isn'@CAPS1 appropriate for their age, but they don'@CAPS1 know the meaning behind the lyrics. And cencoring movies and @CAPS1.V show aren'@CAPS1 going to help much either, because of the internet it has made it easier for teens and children to access thing more easily. So unless we censore the internet to certian. Which nobody wants that to happen then we have to let our children be more open to the public world, because they will find out about certian thing sooner or later.      Censorship is going to shape how our world operates eventually, but it doesnt have to. If parents just sat down with their children more and talked to them about certian then cersorship wouldn'@CAPS1 be needed	3	4	3
3471	2	Censorship in public libraries, allowed? I believe it should be, with a few different veiw points. For one, why should the books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series? Two, @CAPS1 is over a million of us people out @CAPS1 and we all are not a like in many ways. Also @CAPS2, reading is one of those things that we differ with each other. One person might read peaceful warm-hearted stories, than you have people out @CAPS1 like want something more intense to be able to read.      With all of us being different all over the world. Humans have different taste in food, music, movies, and books. All people have different ways to satisfy their pleasures in book readings, to me books are like religons not all of us are the same in that, and at the same time we are all freely living with our reglion without any punichment, so why would you take away books that people love to read freely?  To me, in my eyes is just not right. It's like taking candy away from a innocent baby because it will rot it's teeth out. What I mean by that is, that sure some books to people @MONTH1 offend them yet their might be some people out @CAPS1 being offensive to that persons books and so on, but as all as your baby's teeth aren't rotting out, than why take the candy away? Meaning if the books have each individal shelf with labels on what it was all about, which they do. People wouldn't feel so offensive finding them in the wrong spot.     Looking at the point of veiws do you understand where I come from with this? We are all the same, yet in books we find each other inside of them, finding ourselves into books, I know many book readers with different types of tastes. No matter who they were and who their friends were, we all are different. To many people other than myself, would agree with that. So tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries	3	3	3
3474	2	Can books, music, movies, and other materials be perfect for everyone? Everyone has their own oppinion and beliefs on what materials are good, and what are not acceptable for the human minds. All over the world young kids, young adults, and adults are reading books, magazines, listening to music, and watching movies. Those are all hobbies most people enjoy doing. Everyone reads different kind of books, whether its mystery, romance, or bible based books, people read. Removing books, magazines, and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful empty library.      When people come and search for a book to read, they search for what they think they will enjoy. If they enjoy one thing, another person might not. They might find a book offensive, but does that mean everyone else is offensive by the book as well? Taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book. Everyone is different, everyone has their own story, just like these books do.     Magazines are like books, they are meant to be enjoyed. I believe some magazines might not be appropriate for some people, But that doesn't mean they should take it off the shelf. It means that person should simply not read it. Magazines are made for all people to enjoy, that's why there are so many different kinds. They want to fit each magazine personally to each individual.     Music is the number one entertainment people enjoy. There is a reason why there is so many different genres. The music industry try their best to sort the music to your taste. Just because one song has stuff in it you don't like doesn't mean you can delete that song from everyone. Music is used for many different ways. It relaxes you, pumps you up, it is used for parties, events, and so many other things. All songs are different so you can use them however you want. To band music because someone doesn't like it, changes music forever. There would be no music to listen to.     People should be able to watch what movies they want. That's why there are ratings on movies. What is acceptable for teenagers, but not be acceptful for young kids. That's why they should not watch it. If people banned all the movies they thought were inapropriate. There would be no rented movie stores, theaters, or success in the movie production industry. Everyone should know what kind of movies they like, and they should just watch what they like, and leave the other movies for the people who enjoy it.     No, books, magazines, movies, and music can not be perfect for everyone. Materials bring all different kind of subjects, and stories for everyone. Each materials brings enjoyment to different people. To band all the materials you believe is inappropriate will leave the shelves empty. What kind of library is that	4	4	4
3486	2	I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. Everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. That is what I believe in	1	1	1
3489	2	Do you believe everyone should have their on beliefs? Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture, or have their own opinions? Where's that one place where you can experience all of those? In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library you have the right to have an open mind.     I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries.      If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguements. Everyone could express themselves everyday, in their own way	3	3	3
3495	2	I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelves, to those who they are offending. I myself have not come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me. I believe that we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way perhaps.     First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up, and do something about it. Finding a way to reach a happy medium. If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf there wouldn't be any left in my opinion. If people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies.     Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books, music, and movies. Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read, listen, or watch what we want to. If someone doesn't like the movie we loved, and they take it away it's not fair and buisnesses will lose customers.     Lastly, to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me. I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines in a different way. Instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions. Just like rated @CAPS1 movies, or rated @CAPS2 video games. Books and music can be organized in this fassion also. It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around.     In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or @CAPS3 off of a shelf is not very smart. One, its not fair for people who are not offended. Two, buisnesses will lose customers. Three, there is a better way to solve this problem	4	4	4
3500	2	I don't think they should take down any book because they were donated to us in the first place.Also,I dont think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in there lifetime.Look at it and try to live life as you would in another persons shoes.Try to see where they come from and there life style.Im not as big reader or anything but wants I get that one book that just catches my eye and sounds good to read I look at it and if it is good I would take it and read for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book.So I keep reading and reading and like in the middle of the story my teacher makes me stop reading.I would read as long as it takes but it just has to be the right book for me.I like all kinds of books from sports to sad emotional books.I like reading out loud to myself it helps me understand a little bit better.	2	2	2
3505	2	I do not think that anything is really offincive so i wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves. I do not easily get affended so i don't know what some things would be offincive but i guess that black poeple would be offincive of a rasist book?     I don't think that porn or anything involving nudety should be used in school library's because some parents are very stricked about that kind of stuff and that is very inapropriet for school. I think some parents take it over the top with whats inapropriet and what's not. Library's that are just public library's are totally diffrent and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal on what there about. If the people don't like it they don't need too look at it or get it.      So, i think that library's should have all diffrent kinds of books and movies. If the people don't like it then they can leave, and don't have too worry about it. That is what i have too say about that problem. I hope that this has changed or proswaded you alittle bit	3	3	3
3538	2	Censorship               Censorship is it needed in todays societey? Where things that were considerd bad @NUM1 even @NUM2 years ago are ok today to be veiwed read listened to and so on. Is it a  needed process or should libraries have free will to stock there shelves with what ever they seem fit to be there.Is it still a good process to use or is it a outdated uneeded resource that is now no longer needed.          Everybody in todays soicitey says to read, but libraries @MONTH1 not have the type of litature that your are in to, so why would you want to read somthing that you do not like because the library dos not have the book that you wanted to to see i.       I believe that censorshop in libraries should be their  to remove any book the find offenseive or immoral from there libary. I do not belive they should remove books becasue of  bad language, or somthing about god.        I think that books or magazines or movies with '@CAPS1' content should be removed from libraries if they see it fit. Libraries should only feature books tht they want to have not ones that are popular but considerd 'bad' by the library. They should only have books they want to have.       I do believe that their should be censorship in libarys. I just do not belive that it should be a harsh system. I think that they should set standards on what they want to have and following those standards on books they buy.               I do think however that some libraries will set their standards to low or high that they wille ether have many books that are considerd 'bad', or no books at all. It is a very fine line when it comes to materials that the library has to be considerd good or bad. I think libraies should havea  set of standards nation wide to set what type of material is good for libraries.          I believe that censorship is still a needed, and helpful process. I just think that it is to much of a opionated process. not enough facts or opions of the poeple. I think that is should remain in use for society i just belived it should be more under control then it is today.	3	2	3
3548	2	Do I believe that vertain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make alot of people happier.      The wants and needs of people varie from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another @MONTH1 hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want.     Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has postive influences. That's life though and not everyone has th same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well.     Opinons will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.	3	3	3
3549	2	Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure.  These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf.     One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'.  This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people.    A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4.  This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'.  Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart.  But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real.       But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs.  The book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs.     So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive.  Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1'!	4	4	4
3567	2	There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library. You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made up stories for fun. There are some materials in a library though that could be offensive. But should those materials be removed from the library? Some think that they should and others think that they shouldn't be.     In my opinion I don't think that things should be removed from a library. Certain people @MONTH1 find things offensive and others @MONTH1 think it is perfectly fine to have in a library. I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in  library.     I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material. People don't want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult. That would teach kids bad things that they don't need to be reading about. I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults. That way kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults.     I also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about. Like if there are books on slavery they should have an area for books that are about that that way people who are offended be it know to stay away from it. The same with magazines. i don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people @MONTH1 enjoy reading them.     Some reading material @MONTH1 be found offensive to certain people but to othersit @MONTH1 not be. I think things shouldn't be removed from libraries. There are some things that people @MONTH1 need have in a library if they are doing a project that way they have the resources to do it.     I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store. kids don't nedd to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school. That just isn't right. Espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing.     So in my opinion there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library. Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing. Magazines and other things should be kept away to where only adults could get to them	4	4	4
3592	2	As said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should sperate their books only as they do already.     Some material does seem to advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic gwroth. Some people should think that school should not read @PERSON1 due to racism in the south. This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. If there were those soprt of restrictions then schools would lack much of histories best literature.     Just as the movies do for the gerneal population, @CAPS1 is for @NUM1 and up while @NUM2 is for @NUM3 and up. These are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem.Yet this is already done in libraries. There would be no reason to break these sectiopns up more then they already are broken. There is the young adult section, adult, and youth. Those are the main catagories that most perople want sperate due to offensivce material such as drugs, sex, and alchohol.     Much of the media that is public today is censered and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the outh can stunt them academically	3	3	3
3593	2	Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some? Why is it offensive and how is it offensive? What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and movies that are offensive to some of the people?     In my opinion there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons. Some reasons @MONTH1 include: the put down on races, comments in the book, how the author wrote it and who it was written towards.      Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use. Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personal.      Music can be offensive to some people becasue of the language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children @MONTH1 listen to it, and children nowadays say things they here from music and try to be like the person saying it.     Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated. A good movie would be @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today.      Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting ahold of things like that.      Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library. So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are ofensive to some people. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So therefore it's  not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it.	4	4	4
3594	2	Censorship?  What is it?  Well from what i know cenorship is where you are blocked from certin things that you are not able to ever bring into the place that blocked it.  So the question is it wrong to censor something or not, i think that libraries should be able to censor certins things that people find offensive.  First reason why i think it is right that people should be able to censor things is becuase little childeren could be able to take at peek at what they shouldn't be looking at, when it comes to magazines and also movies.  Next reason why i think labraries should be able to cenor is because people can find centin things offensive just as music, for example like vulgar language can be listened to and aslo also naughty things can be watched in movies.  My last reasoning why i think it is fair that libraries are able censor things is beacuase some people like to read but in thier reading can be bad things that they find offensive and they can always find a way to take an item out from a labrary.  These are reasons why i think they should be able to censor books, music, movies, and also magazines.     My first reasoning in why i think it is fair that libraries are able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines is because little childeren could be able to look at things things they should not be able to take a peek at.  Thses things could be like pronogaphy, and also really grusome things in magazines and in movies.  If these things were in labraries they can possibly show other childeren, inwhich it would not be good.  This can be a problem beacuase parents can put the blame on the libraries by saying that the workers didn't do a good job at watching out for the children.  Also i think think they should be able to censor movies beacuse little childern shouls not be watching gursome movies at a young age.  This can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines.  Also labraries can censor music.      I also think libraries can censor music beacause in music these days there are very bad things that any body can find that is offensive.  Little childern can be listenig to vulgar lyrics that are in the songs and they could be repeating it to other people.   This can be bad in many ways because first of all they might not know what they are saying,  so if one day they say it to an adult, that adult can put the blame on the library owners.  Also they should be able to censor movies again beacuse naughty things can be shown in those movies that certin age levels should not be able to see.  These are ressons why libraries have a right to censor music and movies.   They aslo have right to censor books.      Books in they libraries are great but some books should not be able to be in a library, certin books such as books about faith and other religions.  And also about gursome items.  Some people can find books about religion and faith to be very offensive because some people @MONTH1 not see eye to eye about other religions.  And to minimize this problem libraries can take these books out so peolpe won't find it be offensive.   And also libraries should be censoring certin books about death because it can really get to a person and they can show other people that will find it very offensive.  So this is why i think libraries should be able to censor things.     In conclusion libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines, because in some books they can have religion problems and problems with death,  movies beacuse in some movies it can show pronography and gursome things that peopel should not be watching,  and they should be able to censor magazines and music beacuse in magazines childern could be looking at certin things they shouls not be looking at.  And they should be able to censor music beacuse peopel can be offended if they ever listen to vulgar language.  So in other words i do think libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines	4	4	4
3600	2	Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages. That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way. I will talk about why I disagree with this statement. Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement.     I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from. So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book.     If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.     Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them.     This is my opinion of the statement. Many people @MONTH1 not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement. Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy. Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them.	4	4	4
3606	2	Curse words, alcohol, drugs, pornigraphic pictures. These are all things you would not like your children to use, see, or do. They are out in the world and and there is nothing that you can do to stop it. People do drugs and drink everyday, but just because someone sees you doing it doesnt mean they will too.     People should not be shielded from the real aspects of life. When shielded as a child they would not know what do to if the chances came to them to do drugs or drink. They @MONTH1 not even know what the right or wrong thing to do is. Kids to a certain age deserve to know whats going to happen in the real world when they grow up and start a life. It won't happen to everyone but they need to know these things.     It is important for parents to let their children know what is right or what is wrong. As an adolesent, they are very vulnerable to all the bad stuff that life can bring. Seeing these things in books, movies, magazines and etc. will effect their life in some way. It is their job to show them the right path.     A thing that helps these parents are restrictions on the stuff that you are able to get your hands on. On movies there are age restrictions that inable people at a certian age to be able to watch and people that are within those guidelines to have access. With other materials like books, music, and magazines, there is no way to deny access to people to see or read them. Parents just need to be observent to their children and see what they do.      Censorship is normally a bad thing, but in others it could help. For people that are more vulnerable to those situations or seeing those things, it could greatly help with some people and show them that it is not right. As much as people should be open and be able have access to this information, it is also important that other people did not see it. It is still an open debate, but, in opinion, censorship should not be done. Everyone had their own right to get and see the things they want	4	4	4
3608	2	Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive. Who can say what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you be your own person if people are making desisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movie, music, magazines, ect., should be taken off library selves because someone finds them offensive.      Who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them. How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person?. I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opioion, but maybe the next person that walks by and see's the so call offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone elses decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their chose not someone elses to make for them.       If every peson took a book off the selves that they thought to be offensive then we would not longer have any books on the selves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and dont like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves?     You can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? well you @MONTH1 not but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it but is that fair?	4	4	4
3614	2	I believe that it is unfair to ban ony sort of materials from the library.  It simply isnt right to withold information from your children.  Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway.  Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a book or magazine or hearing it in a movie or cd?  Then they can ask parents any questions that they @MONTH1 have about things they have read and heard instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information.     If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine wouldnt you like to know?  Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong.  Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certian things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small?     Any of the things that they @MONTH1 read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet.  On the internet there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects.  Your childs curiosity could take them to inappropriate websites.      When i was a child and I was curiouse my parents sheltered me from certian things. I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in @NUM1 grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read.  I felt like I couldnt talk to my parents about these things.  I mean what would you do if your second grader came home form school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus.  What if the high schoolers had been lieing to me, I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about.      What I'm saying is that understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear.  It isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions. Besides isn't it your fault in all reality if they get they're hands on somthing innapropriate for their age becuase they aren't getting the proper supervision?  If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is in appropriate, ask questions.  Explain things to them when they ask you a question.  Don't beat around the bush.  Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. It truely is not fair to take these things away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it	4	4	4
3625	2	Censorship at  the library is not needed at all times. It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certin cases when it's needed though.     It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids. they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them.     The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it.     Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not rignt. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be down right mean some times. The whole world is just corupted.     There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature. People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read. The library shouldn't censor their books.	3	3	3
3634	2	Yes  I do think that if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out  the library because the libary is a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know.Here is why I say this.     If you go to a library and you see something that you dont like and you dont think it is apppraite for people to see then it should be taken  off the shelf. I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied with the books, movies, music or anything else especially if childern are involed.People should be able to go to a public place where they are satistfied with the way they carry their place, also it should be suitable place for childern to come and learn.The libary is a learning enviorment where education, growth and devolopement should be inspired.     My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the libary are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf. I know that childeren should be able to go to a liabrary and be satistfied on the way the libary is.	3	3	3
3635	2	Should materials in libraries be censored? No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad.     What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ? If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get.     I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there. and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library.     So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people.	3	3	3
3642	2	Dear @CAPS1 paper,     I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well.  For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books.          First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well. I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books.          Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive.          However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray. My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive.          Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view.	3	3	3
3645	2	I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things. For example in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me or other people too. Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images, videos or bad words that should not be use  for everybody to hear or see. You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music, I'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids. This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth, if you think something is being bad say it, and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else	3	3	3
3652	2	So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks @CAPS4. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, @CAPS4's about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf.     I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, @CAPS4's @CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave.      What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 off line. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library?      But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs. Say you gotta @NUM2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? I mean in sounds corny but @CAPS4 can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a @CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where @CAPS4 goes bad.      After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to @CAPS2 they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But @CAPS4's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's @CAPS2 a library has many, many choices when @CAPS4 comes to books.      That's when the question comes up, '@CAPS2 don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' @CAPS3, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for @CAPS4? Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms.     @CAPS4 sounds crazy, but @CAPS4 wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for @CAPS4, check @CAPS4 out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. @CAPS4 sounds easier that looking @CAPS4 up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number.      All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause @CAPS4 @MONTH1 be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, '@CAPS4's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.	4	4	4
3663	2	I dont think there should be any censorship good books and music shouldint be removed just becaus one person finds it offensive. Becaus the opinion's of one @MONTH1 be diffrent with another.I beleave music is cencord the most becaus  not many people get offendid by books but censorship in music i think is destroying it.Becaus its an artists way of expresion and if people dont wana listen to what there saying then they should just not listen to it.Books i think shouldint be taken offensivly forthe same reason music shouldint its a writers oppinion and expresion its like telling someone they cant voice there oppinion on anything like racesim or use curse words if they want.	2	2	2
3675	2	Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that sceen is inapropiate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books.     Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, @CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.     Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music.     Book tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books becuse of inapropiate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.     A lot of theings seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so stricked when it comes to movies, music, and books.	3	3	3
3676	2	The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow.     At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose.     My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it.     Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives.     If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains.	4	4	4
3694	2	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the yound @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 section, easy children or picture and @CAPS1.      Young @CAPS1 or the @CAPS2 section is for mainly the teens. They have books that a teen who normally read. The @CAPS2 section has music which teens listen to. For @CAPS4 they have the twlight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language.The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them.It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed.     There is also a childrens section called the easy or picture book section. This section are for the younger children. Children that are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals. Things that children would like to read, listen or watch about. For @CAPS4 this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, athur, even lilo and stitch. eveything in this section is made for children there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent who think is offensive.     The library has a section for adults. The @CAPS1 section is there to catch adults eye. It a separate fom the @CAPS2 and Children sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an @CAPS1 who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in thier section. The library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for. It would not have something little children would want.      The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people I dont think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies music etc	3	4	3
3702	2	From what I seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content.  I think that libraries should keep the thing in the shelves but seperated from the rest if found offensive.  It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it.  I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place.          My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended.  I like the saying sticks and stones @MONTH1 break my bones but words will never hurt because it says if your offended then get over it.  Why should your opinion speak for everyone else.  Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is if someone really wants to know they could always find a way to get it so the censorship thing is kind of pointless.  I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard.          My conclusion is that they should seperate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library.  They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it.  Simple stuff like this can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have look at the stuff that he hates.	3	3	3
3703	2	I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books, movies, music, magazines ect. People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff.      Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive.     For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life. In history @CAPS2 because he killed people. Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self. which is a saying I have heard many of times.          So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, edgucate, and entertain themselves by. Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people	3	4	3
3710	2	Does The Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2?                                                               @CAPS2's alot of books out @CAPS2 that I would love to take off the shelve's but the one book I would to take off the shelve's would be 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4'. While I read that book it had alot of offensive language and alot of graphic not only in the book but in the movie to. On top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all. The only thing good about the movie is @CAPS2 was a few dramatic and thats it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions. But some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's. I think the story overall was alright beside the fact @CAPS2 was offensive in it though. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards.                                   So obviously 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year. So In @CAPS7, I think @CAPS2 should be censorship in libraries.	2	2	2
3741	2	Censorship in Libraries     I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library	2	2	2
3742	2	Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose.  This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's.  Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books peole read.     Censorship of books is competely unneccessary.  If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to.  Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice; nobody forced them to read it.  Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book.  Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose.     Finding a book offensive is a simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence.  So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not?  Just because somebody running a library belives a book to be offensive or innappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf.  There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive.     Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already.  Movies for example, are all rated, and this therfore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch.  The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects.  By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films.  It is simply not thier responsibility.     Music also is rated, and if thought neccessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content.  Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be innappropriate.     Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'.  As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material; not the librarian's.     Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians.  Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise.	4	4	4
3745	2	Yes! i believe that because such as books had alots of informtionsalso when listen musice i feel like so sweet like i maen i'm so happy... when i read the magazines i know about the world something about people and animlas about... @NUM1 i belive that because musice is good for listening..when you listen musice everyday you know what they mean then you will be know the mean, first i'm listen american musice i feeled like crazy now i know how to listen musice...Yes! i belive that because the magazines is good for reading .one think when i caome american i feel like so sad because i don't no anyboday also i don't no how to read magazines that's why, and two month later i have new friend then they teach me how to speak @CAPS1 and they teached me how to read magazines @NUM2 yers later  i got alots of friends in school my teacher told me kabee don't worry about to learn speak @CAPS1 when you come school everyday you will be speak @CAPS3 very well then  i'm studies everyday for learn speak @CAPS3   now i can speak @CAPS3 very well at @CAPS4 i love all teacher because they are teached me how to speak @CAPS3 that's why...	2	2	2
3746	2	In the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private. If this something is said and we don't like it we find the urge to rid the @CAPS2 of to '@CAPS1' other people from it. In modern writing @DATE1 and all throughout history there have been certain books that we don't like because they go against what we find moraly right. But just because a group of people say it's wrong is there a need to completely abolish from the @LOCATION1?     No. When something is written it is written for a purpose. If there was no purpose then we wouldn't have anything to read at all in the first place. Yes, there are some books and magazine's that can be very vivid and unsutable for younger minds to experience. But that it is why these books are created for older people to read.      I am a large fan of books over the two @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that took place. I find them very fascinating and I love to see what my life could be like @DATE1 if the outcomes of those @CAPS3 would have been different. I will admit many of these books contain things that are very real in a sense that some adults even can't handle, but this would be no reason to get rid of them all together. These books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know. Without these books these @CAPS3 can become something in the past and nothing more.     There are also many books out there that have a large deal to do with very mature themes. These bookos can include very detailed areas about a sex scene. Yes indeed these books can definently be very unsutable for younger kids. But that is where the idea that these books were not created for them. They were created for older more mature readers. Also if we are so concerned as to what our children are seeing then that is where the parent would have to step in. The parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading.     Looking out for what are children see is a large matter, the other side though is the thought of people getting ideas from reading more intense books. For instance when people find something that they truly believe in they can become very motivated to expand peoples knoledge of that matter. If one person reads a book about poloitics and see a side that they have never seen before they could become driven to form a group to drive that thought or matter into all of the minds of the human race. This could greatly affect us by having a large amount of people come to an uproar at a group even as large as our current governament. But even though this could happen what type of free, run by the people for the people, group are we now.     Overall putting restrictions on the things we read or see, to our country, would have to be moraly wrong. Limiting what are nation can see would lead to most likely more of an uproar than just having to deal with different thoughts or outlooks of a group of people. This could happen because people would see it as the government maybe making more socialist acts by trying to control our knoledge.	4	4	4
3762	2	I think censorship  should be allowed and the libraries because many people have diffrent oppions of what type of books they like and should read.I don't think people should remove books or any type of materials just because of hte dislike.Many people think by looking a diffrent types of  materials can have you look for the right imformation.I feel that if you limit the books and libraries that whould be less resources to help out with the imformation that you are trying to recieve.Many people find it hard if the imformation they are wonted is not there and the local libraries. Libraries should a be able to find all the books, music, movies and magazines they wont and need.Books should never be tooking of the self but only should be allowed more on the shelves for any imformation that are needed	2	2	2
3773	2	If you are sitting in the librarie and you are minding your doing your homework and studing for a test next hour, I wouldn't thank you would want to be messed with.Would you? Well im going to explan what I think about everything that's in the libraries. Like some stuff we should have in their and some stuff we shouldn't. I beleave you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a librarie.      There are some things in the world today that alot of people find offensive. Their are like people that are offensive and things that go on in our and your area were you live that are really offensive. When it comes to our libraries there are some things that need to be change and some thing that don't need bothered. There are some book some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries but to other people mite enjoy them. But I don't beleave that they should be taken off the shelf. They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to easy.     You wouldn't like for some books taken off of the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids. They just need to be move to a shelf were only bigger kids can get to. When I am studying I like to listen to music. It helps me think what I am going and calms me down. But when I don't have my music playing I don't like when other people have there to loud. Thats one thing that need to be changed in the libraries. Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf. Another thing that has been a problem is magazines. There are alot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be watched. I beleave if anything is offensive it should be taken off the shelf.      Some people freak out every easy and this world is every offensive and people need to think about other people. If they don't somebody mite take it the wrong way and it could get bad	3	2	3
3796	2	Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world.  They contain many different styles and genres of books.  Some might not be appropriate for young children to read.  There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves.  I believe that no book should be denied of this right.  Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.     Most libraries have children sections.  Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section.  So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway.  Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.     Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child.  Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library.  If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.     Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like.  They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off.  If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves.  The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly.  People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not.  Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.      There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing.  Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen.  Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen.  Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read.  Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.	4	4	4
3804	2	In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be romoved or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable.      In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books @MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin.      There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on.      Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's @PERSON1 on the front page with no hair, or @LOCATION1's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely.      People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you dont want to see it, don't buy it. Its quite simple	4	4	4
3806	2	Many people, after reading a book, listening to a song, watching a movie or reading a magazine have found themselves upset or disturbed by that peice of media and feel that it should be removed from the shelf they found it on. I feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing, that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books, magazines or @CAPS1.      My opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive. It depends on that person's background, religion and personal beliefs. I do not that think books, magazines or @CAPS1 shoulds have to be banned from library shelves just because that particular person finds that peice of material offensive. If they find it so disturbing then they should discontinue reading that book or magazine, or listening to that @CAPS3.       One person should not be able to make the choice of keeping a certain book or magazine on the shelf because somewhere out there, I'm sure there is someone who does not find it offensive. The partial point of writing a book or song is to express one's opinion of a topic and if the reader or listener does not approve of their opinion, then they should respect that director or author's thoughts and move on. If a library or media center contains inapropriate books, magazines or moviees, they should create special areas or shelves to keep such material. This area could be created for adult or mature readers, viewers or listeners. I also think that books and other peices of media of such inapropriateness should have a label regarding its offensive or explicit content.     If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing; I do not think that a single person has the right to have it removed from the public and that there are other ways to keep such material out of a reader or listener's hand, that @MONTH1 not know about its possible offensiveness. If warning signs are shown, then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed. If such measures are taken, I think they will keep all readers, viewers and listeners pleased.	3	4	3
3816	2	Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive? Well i think that they they should be put to a vot for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide. That some might not find it offensieve as others do. No because people have different beleafs than others.     I think they should be put to a vote for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide because the staff might think its morally incorrect and morally offensive. But others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff. The staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do.     Some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently. No one person thinks the same reson unless they have been told what another person thinks. the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason. Weather they like it or not all books teach a lesson about life.     No because people have different beleafs then others. In one culter that book might be aloud and they might live around that library. So that would make then miss out on going to the library for books. For example, if the library choose to take out the bible and romance novels then they would loss a lot of customers. Their business would fall.     The library staff should not be aloud to choose what books are aloud because if some one has a fine they get money.  So my answer is no because they shuld put it to a vote, some might not find it as offensive as others do, and people have different beleafs than others do. No one person has the same thought that the next person does it is impossible	3	3	3
3837	2	I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries. All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons @MONTH1 not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read.     I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some. My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer. Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value. Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surrreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them. Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject. Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for, a resource for knowledge.     All offensive items a library @MONTH1 have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes. No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the sheilding nature of others.	3	3	3
3879	2	i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult show's. i can see why they put it on the kid's show's.. but like really?you guys will put that stuff on good movies? or song's!? what has ever happened to freedom of speech?	1	1	1
3940	2	Now, one way or another that certain peice of material will be found and be used.     Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others. So really, either way you @MONTH1 try to remove any material that you think is offensive but is it your right? I don't suppose so, I would consider that unfair. It's unfair that you were able to see this material and just because you thought it was offensive, it does not mean that others @MONTH1 find that offensive in their opinion.     So the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous. For you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being an @CAPS1 for the author of that material. Having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers, readers, listeners, etc. to look at and use, would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive. It's big world out there, you think just because you can try and hide certain material from people in your area to see, that no one will find a way, people will always find a way for it to get out or be found.     It would be as if your trying to control what people should be viewing, listening, reading, etc. Almost as if your in control of people, but you got to realize that you can't hide everything in this world. Also that not everybody in this world has the same mind set as you do, and that what ever you find offensive @MONTH1 not, or actually does not mean everyone else does.      So this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or group of people find offensive. Do not try to control what people or childeren should view, listen, or read becuase it will be found sooner or later. No matter how hard you want this world to be perfect, reality is that it won't happen and you can't keep everthing hidden	4	4	4
3958	2	Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldnt have. Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazies, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kind of things affect our every day living.      Lets start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not wan't my children reading about that kind of violence. Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about. Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of @NUM1, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that @MONTH1 be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about. I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days i for sure wouldn't wan't my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people.     Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about steeling on it. Thats aother thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.     The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any sircumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't approperiate for schools to have.     The last one is magazines. There should notbe magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble.     Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library.	3	3	3
3959	2	If there is any books, movies, music or magizines that is offensive, then I think it should be removed from the bookshelf because of caution for little kids. Everyone wants to look at different movies, books or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have too know where kids get acts from. The books can be left on the shelf, if the younger kids does not bother them. They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows. There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if its not right for there kids. Yes, books, magazines, movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive. This is neccasary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures. So have kids stay away from offensive materials.           There is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to. Such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v. shows or even movies. If the movie is offensive then it should definantly stay off the shelfs. Inless it is just grown ups in the house. If movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house. Younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room.           Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the @CAPS1. If parents don't want there kids growing up to be bad people then I advice all parents to keep the worse @CAPS2 away from children and hide them all. They can always hide them in the rooms, in a desk draw for child safety. Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around.      Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not neccasary for children. Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it. There @MONTH1 be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young. So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them.      I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good. Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from. If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it wont be bad. They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults. So, sometimes you have to treat them like an adult. Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive. Movies needs to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines needs to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they arn't suppose too.	3	4	3
3963	2	Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves.  Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.      One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections.  Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice.  It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book.     Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned.  If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today.  If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone.  Censorship holds back many artists true potential.  Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world.     I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left.  Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else.     Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something.  As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right.   Censorship shouldnt be in libraries.	4	3	4
3964	2	Is it offensive?          Should people have the right to take down other people ideas? What do you think; I think so ? for centuries people have been writing,making video,and, all types of music. Some consider it a freedom of speech. Others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy.     I believe @CAPS1 are exceptional writers and promising producers  and artists. But not all medias are good. Over a vast amount of time young children have been influenced by medias such as:books,movies,music,etc...Its perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media .But thats not all @CAPS1 are more cases than just children that are suffering theres also religon, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups.          @CAPS1 should be a certain rules and certains laws that are against such wrong doings.But everyone is entiltled to @CAPS1 opinion.Hundreds of people are discreminated because of what they here and see in the medias.A life changing expierience for me was the movie The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This could be considered offensive to lots of peolpe such as those of the african american decent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse.          This is just a few issues with freedom of speech ,but @CAPS1 will always be disagreements and differennt views of oppinion.But I for one believe that theres just certain stuff that shoukdnt be allowed to be put out in to public media	3	3	3
3968	2	Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? I thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. And then you wouldnt have even known about it. Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see.	3	3	3
3973	2	Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you? If you said yes, how is that any different than a white boy saying i can't learn with this black girl in class with me? Or if two people with different religions yould say he or she offends me because we dont believe in the same god.     Just because someone is offended by book or wrighting does not mean it should by removed form the shelf. In fact if they dont like it they dont have to read or even look at it. That is one freedom we have in america is to read anything we would like to. For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom.          In conclusion it is not okay for anything to be takin off of a public shelf no matter who in offends. It is a right we have as american's to read or wright anything we would like to, And removing offencive meteral would be taking away our freedom	3	3	3
3994	2	There are many opinions on censorship in libraries. Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while other believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and its free will that allows people to pick up these books. No one if forcing them to read them.      I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion. I feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate. For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrong doings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate. Some poliliticians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter. Another example would be a book on religious purposes. For instance, a book on an @CAPS1 religion. Some @CAPS2 might take it as offensive if the informations paints them as being a certatin stereotype, but others @MONTH1 see it as educational learning.      I also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will. No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song. It's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us. I feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who @MONTH1 be coming to rent the book that day. Its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter.      I also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes. I believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive. I think that the library is a place where people can go and research information. Some of the material found @MONTH1 be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong'. I think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational books would not be available today.      The library is a place where our free will comes into play. I feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries. These books all contain information that could be veiwed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decifer for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable. I believe that no one should decide for us	4	4	4
4001	2	In all libraries you are offered a choice on which book you would like to choose. So if you want to read a book with no censorship or if you want censorship then you can. The libraries should not take away books because of the content, in my honest opinion it should be the readers choice and not someone elses.      When choosing a book you have to think, do I really want to read this? each book gives you a little description on the back of the book giving you a little inside so you can tell if you would like to read the book or not. I do believe if it has sugested content that you should not let little kids read them but at a high school level we pretty much are able to make choices for ourselves.      Music should not be censored because if  a song says something that you dont want to hear like cussing or sugestive content then just turn the station. You dont have to sit and listen to the song, you can change it with a click or push of a button. Songs that are on the radio are for enjoyment and entertainment so you made the choice to go to that station and listen to the music that is on it, you made the choice and nobody can make it for you.      With movies they have a description on the back that tells what is going to be in the movie and what it's rated, if you don't want to watch a moive with bad language or bad content you should not have chose the movie in the first place it is clear as day on the case what will be in it. On movie cases it even gives you pictures of certain scenes and if they seem a little sugestive then put it back and select a differnt movie.      Magazines are meant to tell the truth and sometimes the truth is hard. Magazines are stocked on shelves in stores and on the front will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself. If you are really bothered by certain language thumb threw the magazine and see if it is approprate or not for you.      Libraries should not have to get rid of books just because some content, a person who walks threw those doors should be aware of what is in the library and what exactly they will find. In libraries they have catagorys in which certain topics are under, by going towards a selection it is saying that you understand what type of book it will be	4	4	4
4028	2	When @LOCATION2 was made and our fore fathers signed the constituition of the @LOCATION1, freedom was the big kahuna. With every signature endorsment added to the constituion, @LOCATION2 became one of the few countries with freedom in every right. Laws such as 'you are innocent until proven guilty' and freedom of speech have made our country stand out from other nations that suppress thier own people.Freedom is @LOCATION2's middle name and it is the birth right to our future!     Freedom of speech has been shown everywhere and even though some people's voices say a little too much it is still a right given to us so we must accept the nonsense that is said. Offensive things are common, since we are all differnt and the variety of ethnic groups in @LOCATION2 are so vast, that at one point in time someones toe are going to get seriously stepped on. This is not tolerated but still it goes on through the world. Freedom of speech is a unidentified form of express, since it is allowed to say what you feel but sometimes it is said to much and you end up in a fight.       Speech is still a freedom though, and if we cut out freedom we would be in a bad spot. Genocide, and inlawful inprisonment are two factors that happen regulary on account of no freedom. If you speak out against a powerful figure, you go to jail. If you belief in something differnt armys come and kill you, all because some country do not have freedom like @LOCATION2. This freedom might cause controversy and produce offensive products such as reading material and videos but its alot better than living under the shadow of a dictator.      Crude forms of freedom always end up on magazines, books, and cd's but if you think about it there being produced then they are being bought, or they would not be made at all. On certain occasions items are not being made for economical benefit but mearly on belief and religous values, that is also a freedom that many have paid with there life, to have. Also with the production of books, movies, and cd's you are protected from being exposed to points of view you do not like these things do have a rated supervision system, and if you do not like the product put it down and walk away, yes it is that easy.       I do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon, we might just have to keep living with offensive products. We should all just be glad we live in afree society that lets us express our diffrence without being killed in the process. You cant just go take the constitution and disgard like trash so society will just have to bear the burden of expressed freedom. Freedom comes in disc and books but it is still @LOCATION2's middle name and the birth right to our future	5	4	5
4055	2	Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It @MONTH1 even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed.     The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset.     The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They @MONTH1 not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material.     The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that @MONTH1 be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them.     Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil trip to the library. No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves. It's a win win situation.	4	4	4
4064	2	Nowadays, children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading you can imagine. Some magazines, books, and movies that are age appropriate. Children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines, books, and movies. Should we remove these inappropriate items? Can we somehow get kids to not see them? Children are very curious. They want to know about everything and they will ask as many questions as they can. When they see inappropriate items on library shelves, what do we do?     Libraries shouldn't get rid of items that @MONTH1 be inappropriate for children. Instead, there should be a rating system on the books and magazines. Movies have ratings so children don't see things that are inappropriate; books should have those ratings too. If someone wants to check out something that isn't suitable for kids, then they can show the libraian their @CAPS1. Everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age. Libraries could even put all of the most inappropriate items in a separate section of the library. It could be a section that kids could not enter. Parents should also watch their kids to make sure they aren't getting into anything inappropriate.     The only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity. Children can look onto the shelves, but we should put labels on what they can and can't check out. Parents could look out for what their children are trying to read. I believe that's the most we can do.	3	3	3
4071	2	Censorship in libraries? In my opinion I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with perfanity. In my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it.      I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe. Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors/producers. That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment! Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone...Well listen, there are heeps and heeps of books out there you can find that are not bad!      If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent! I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear. But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie. One that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes.     So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of fowl language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries. If some people want to fill their mind with filth, let them. But for you who do not, get other stuff. Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch. Be a role modle and teach them about healthier viewings	4	3	4
4072	2	Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indescent to read or not.     We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What @MONTH1 look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong @MONTH1 be completely normal to the individual they are making the decison for.     Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisons is one of the human races greatest talents. These descisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1. When the government is making decisions that effect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom?       When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. Theses ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books to?      In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types or movies, books, ect. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment.      I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions. This right should never be taken away from us	4	4	4
4098	2	I am writing this essay to puersuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences.     I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries. When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books.     In reaching the conclusion of this article I hope that I have persueaded  the readers to understand the point I am trying to make. I hope my readers take the information I have givin and put it to work	3	3	3
4100	2	Raded @CAPS1 for @CAPS2, violance and some nudety. This kind of movie shouldnt be on any kind of shelf. Its to inapprope for kids, see or even read what the movie case says.     There shouldnt be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures. Its bad for the kids to see or here because one day a little boy/girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble. Its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me. The only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years. But i dont want to watch a movie and see a lady nude.       The nest thing is violance. Man i just wish guns wernt invented or bombs. Because I have lost alot of friends to guns. I lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area. More and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because, of movies and what people say in books and in magazines. People are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market. People get these ideas because of movies.      Last but not least @CAPS2 it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools. They leard it from movies mainly because the actor say the words. Now the kids know how to say them. Sitcs say that kids say and do what there favorite actor says and dose on and off the air.       My conclusion says that all every thing with violance should be taken off the shelfs	3	3	3
4115	2	I am writing this essay to you to tell you. That offensive books,music,movies,magazines,etc., Should not be on our library shelves. Because If are kids pick them up there will be @CAPS1, and crime. Some people mite ask how do I know this well say you see this cd cass that says black mans only cd. And a white boy picks it up well then a black kid sees it and that white boys hand the black guy will try to rip it out of his hand. Therefore starting a fight.	2	1	2
4128	2	Have you ever came across offensive material inside a library? Well some people have and they think there should be  some type of censorship in libraires to protect the offended people . I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express their self through art, literature, and even music. After all the freedom of speech is written in our rights.       Many authors , artist and musicans have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them. I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people but it is their work ,a form of self expression. They do not publish their work to offend people , they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it. An artist's work is a part of who they are. A censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library.     Over many years most libraries have devloped and arranged their media into a system called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This system seperates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own genres. For instince if you are looking for a mystery book , you would find it in the non fiction section. This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for. If people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it. This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive. Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor.      Everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive. It is basically part of our human nature. It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world. In a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive. The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it  do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves. Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor. If everytime that happend there would be no books left to read in our libraries. Most people would not even call that a library.      In the end a book is a book , music is music and we are not going to create censors or take books of the shelves because it is offensive to people. Authors write what they want to write , musicans play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act. After everything  it does not matter what is offensive to people , they will just have to deal with it. There is no reason for a censor in a library	4	4	4
4134	2	As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. Multiple variaties of books @MONTH1 be found at a local library from documantaries to science-fictoin or just fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one @MONTH1 choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposses the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some @MONTH1 disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary meassure that constricts the ability to gain knowlegde.     In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people @MONTH1 be able to enjoy their diferences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dilikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books'(no pag.). If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it shuld be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents.      Still, censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inapropriate, is an inexscusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none osf our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.). The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's belifes. Doing so will not only help libraries but also society.     There are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree. Yet it is important that poeple agree on allowing each other to have a choice. A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read. Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process. Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion. Censoring of libraris should be considered, but not at the exspence of knowledge. Libraries should not be censored.	4	3	4
4140	2	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf. I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up.      I'm a @CAPS2. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things. And its something that would have to be done.      Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing.  I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others	2	2	2
4155	2	I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldnt get to read what they want to. I read world war @CAPS1 books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it.     I think they should age books like this book is for ages @NUM1, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines.	3	3	3
4156	2	I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries. They show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it. People have different beliefs about anything, I don't care what you say everybody still has a different opinion about anything and everything. So just keep believing what you want to believe that's fine, but don't ruin it for others, you ever heard the saying, '' if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all'', well they should remember that saying and stick to it.In my years of being in school nobody has protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone read what they liked because the library supplied people with the material they wanted to read. Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of @LOCATION1, the library says they do not and will not carry such reading history, the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else but they should still be able to find that book in that library. That is history in this world and they should know it. That compares with people wanting to destroy history made in this world, history people risk there lives for to be recognized in this world, this compares with the topic fully. I hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about. That will be all	3	3	3
4181	2	Yes i believe that certain materials such as book's, music, movie's, magazines, etc should be removed off of the shelves at a library if they are offensive in any way. Librarian's shouldnt have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people. Libraries should only have interesting books with good story's to read and kid books. There should be no sexual or racial book's, movies, magazines, etc.     Those thing's that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library and they should'nt be able to see those thing's or check them out. I do agree that library's should have a wide range of different kind of book's, and movies, etc because everybody has there own taste in what they like. But the thing's that are offensive should'nt be on the shelve's.     If library's didnt have offensive thing's on the shelf then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it would'nt cause any problems with people because they would'nt be on the shelf. So if they would just take those thing's off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problem's at the libraries. Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive thing's on the shelves which would make it a much better place to enjoy.	3	3	3
4198	2	Libraries across the world are facing the obstacle of censorship. Censorship has become a bigger deal in this day and age. @CAPS4 can effect books, music, movies, magazines, and many more. This posts the question is censorship a good thing or is @CAPS4 bad?      Censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive. Everyone has there own opinion about things so why should that effect what we are allowed to learn? What one person finds offensive could be perfectly fine with everyone else. Plus you are not being forced to @CAPS3 something you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 want to. If you find @CAPS4 ofensive then one solution is very easy, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!     Censorship not only effects the learner, @CAPS4 effects the writer. Censorship takes away the one thing a writer has, there freedom of speech. Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to voice there thoughts on topics, to show others how they see the world, and to show what might happened to them in their life. Because writers do this, @CAPS4 makes a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate too. Writers have a choice what they want to convey to the world and they should be given the privalge to do so.      Even if you are able to put a censorship on books and music at a library, you can'@CAPS2 censor the internet. The internet has become a place where anyone around the world can find websites that they like, where there are books, music, magazines, and even shopping stores. A library is a public library just like the internet is public too. Anyone should be able to acess @CAPS4 and enjoy what they like.      Putting censorship on things is almost equivilent to not letting a teacher teach because of there nationality or not letting our president give a speech because he is @CAPS5. Censorship is based on a opinion someone has. @CAPS4 shouldn'@CAPS2 effect the learners or the writers. Censorship holds back the voice of society and the thoughts of everyday people. Censorship should not even exist	4	4	4
4212	2	Certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to certain people. When we look at a comic and see that the writer of the comic has said something offensive, what @MONTH1 seem offensive to you @MONTH1 not be offensive to anyone else. Certain pictures or writings that seem full of knowledge and vibrance to you @MONTH1 be completely something else in someone elses eyes.     How many humans inhabit the world today? About @NUM1 billion, researchers say. If you think about it, each and every one of those @NUM1 billion minds thinks differently. If a librarian takes away the knowledge that you find so vibrant, it is like taking away a person's ability to learn.      In the world today, many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved. What that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world. For all you know, the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer. How could you just take that away? Again, the magazine could be offensive to a person who @MONTH1 have cancer or a doctor who treats cancer, but will they be offended when their cancer is cured? Or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away?     If we take everything away that could possibly be offensive to other people, we might as well just take all the books, movies, magazines, and comics away that have ever been created. Once again, something that @MONTH1 be offensive to you would not be offensive to another person, because about @NUM1 billion minds do not all think alike. If reading materials were taken away that are found offensive, our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well.	4	4	4
4224	2	People go to the library to find certain types of material. Some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed. Certain materials should not be removed if found offensive to others because it might not be offensive to someone else that might enjoy it. The offensive material can be history that the world need to know, such as racism. If they did not know the importance of slavery they wouldn't know of the past life and why we are treated the way we are being treated. History is a big part of life that everyone one should know. That's why we have history class to let us know of the history that we've been through.     All material don't have to be history that is offensive. Some material have sex and violence that is offensive. The libraries should have labels on every section to let people know what type of material it is. If people know what type of material it is and still choose to view it then they get what they ask for. It shouldn't be removed because they didn't like it. I learned in history class about wars that had violence in them that some of my classmates didn't like but that's what happened and we needed to know.     Materials are made for a reason. They should not be removed if found offensive to someone but not offensive to another. I read books in school with all kinds of violence and other things people @MONTH1 not like but it's history. History makes a difference in our lives and it's what we need. You can not removed that. If you find it offensive just don't view that material again.	3	3	3
4225	2	I believe that the books, music, movies, magazines should be removed if they are really offensive. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean that it would be to another person. Any movie you watch could be offensive to one person or two but, not everyone. So I would say no to taking the offensive things off the shelfs because, who is really going to be offened by and are they really offened by this matter or aspect.      Also, I believe that some people might lie about if they are offened by it just so that they will take it off the self. Maybe, there is a movie for example, that there is a lot of bad words, I could see them being able to take that off the self because, a lot of people don't like those words to be used and thats understandable. If they are just taking it off the self tho for one little thing I don't think that should be aloud.     I think that if that person is getting offened by what a book said or a movie said then don't read it or don't watch it. No body is forcing you to watch or read a book that you don't want to. Reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say.      I believe that this really has to go down to what the persons beliefs are. Maybe they go to church every day which means that they probably aren't going to be watching the movie ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2.'  They are going to pick a movie more suitiable to their life style and what their use to. Maybe they had a friend that suggested that they should watch a movie and they did, they might have taking offensivness to that, but that was also there choice they didn't have to watch it.      If this was the case to take a book, movie, music out because someone was offened then there would be nothing left. Are you saying that you would listen to everyone if they came in to get a book and then came back and said ' this book offened me, I want you to take it off the self.' I'm sorry but, I'm having a hard time believing that your going to listen to every single person that comes in a says that. Also, @CAPS3 do you know it was offensive to them are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book? My guess is no because you don't want to deal with that many people about one or two maybe even five books.     I'm not saying that people don't get offened by somethings that books and movies say but, your going to have a lot more then just one person come in and say that there are more then just one book or movie. so then there would be no books left. What if you have someone come in and they request that they have a certain movie and you say ' @CAPS4, I'm sorry we had to take that movie off the self because, it offened someone.' I have a feeling that person is not going to be happy and you will have some explaining to do.     Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them that you had to take it down and they say that it was a very nice movie are you going to listen to them also if you listen to one person don't you think that its fair if you listen to the other person also that likes the movie. I am a person that believes theres two parts to every story. So, therefore, I think that you should listen to both sides or keep what you have if that person wants to take it off the self then do it but, if someone asks for that specific one then I would let them have it because that isn't going to hurt the person that got offened by the book or movie is it.     Therefore, I think that they should keep the books, movies and music all on the seleves unless more then one person complains then it would be a different story.	3	4	3
4232	2	When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section.     To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others @MONTH1 not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one.     Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It @MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already.     Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves. There @MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they @MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it.     In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea.	4	4	4
4236	2	To be honest if I was a librarian I would leave them up on the shelfs accoding to what @MONTH1 state law would have to say. If the state doesn't have any promblems with having them up on the shelfs then all student body will be able to check them out. having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not. Also just like checking out a book how you have to take a test over it called reading counts. Then you would have to read an article from a page in the magazine and wright an essay over it and submit it to whom ever is in charge of that department.	2	2	2
4237	2	Many things such as books, music, magazines, ect., causes problem acts for children to act different, but i say that everything should stay in the library because there more things that causes acts than the things that are listed. Many children get their acts from books, movies, and magazines but most get their acts from something different.   Children gets most of their acts from the television that their viewing at home wich causes them to think if their parents doesn't care about what their watching than it's okay to view what ever.So the most that is causing acts is what is being viewed at homes or in the movies. So I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch what evers legal on television.   But to me in the the libraries it's up to whoms ever controling it should decide by ages. just like legal things only legal for adults. I say that it's only for adults because childern starts argument from what ever they see expecially when their around their friends. When children is around their friends they feel that it's cool to do what ever. And it's all coming from thing based on violence in the books that children reads more often. So to me I will say that it shouldnt be okay for what is being viewed.	3	3	3
4264	2	i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing. i think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level bc alot of kids arn't even going to really try on this test till like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year and also alot of teachers dont even teach this material till the end of the year           so i think that some of the stuff that u all test on should be changed like the stuff you test on and how long the test is and should be more focest on reading and writing levels     however i do agree that the test should still be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work     i think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper to because some kids test better on paper then on a computer     this is the way i feel about the test. i know i was supose to write about offensive material but i couldnt think how i felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mid so i thought i would enform u think you very much	2	2	2
4284	2	No I @CAPS1 not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason. Sure some things might not be appropriate for certain people or age groups, but everyone is gonna eventually here, see, or be involved in something they are not supposed to like, enjoy, or agree with.	2	2	2
4308	2	Have you ever sondered through the libray just to specifically find that one good book, magazine, or even cd that didn't involve inapropiate material for once? You feel like a little kid in the shopping mall just inpatiently waiting to find that one toy, but it never shows up. You spend seconds, minutes, even hours still slowly pacing back and forth shelf to shelf, and finally you find it and you open it and see the most innapropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgure language, or even take a skim through the most offensive reading yet. Do you wish it'd change?     I visit the library every time after i finish my book, I have loved reading from the time I was little. Lately i feel like my reading iterest has gone down though, not due to my act of being involved in other things, but possibly because lately I feel like every book I pick up comes off offensive. For example I went to  the check out a new book, I was mind boggled at this time because unlike usual I had no clue on which book I was even interested on to read next. The librarian directed me to there new best seller and said addressed it and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. I checked it out and after the first paragraph I wanted to throw up. This book and too gory and i felt like it downgraded women, I was anything but satisfied. This wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. I just hope i could check out a book not so offensive and actually worth my time, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me.     Our library seems to be over packed with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because I love them. I label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time. I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end. Lately my opinion has changed though, these magazines are starting to alter and I don't like it. It seems as if I can't open my page without seeing a half dressed girl, some innapropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal display of affection. Seeing these vulgare images are enough to make me not only flip the page, but also never second guess about opening a magazine again.      Music is like a drug to me, and I am addicted. There is never a day that goes by that I do not listen to music, but lately music just isn't the same. I go to the library to check out some new cd's and it seems everything I bother listening to uses every curse word out there. I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actaully sell this garbage. I am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new innapropriate vocabulary.      I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there. We just need to find it again. I hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnesesary items at the library. I know i'd greatly appreciate it, and from what I heard many others would too. We want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind to take a glance at, and we won't music that won't pollute our brains	4	4	4
4314	2	There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions.     Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely. To keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @MONTH1 damage other people.     However this can also be argued. The people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library.           In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also.	3	3	3
4325	2	My name is @CAPS1 and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that are found offensive should be take off the shelves. I have never came across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them. I'm not the type of person who would start an argument but i am a type of person who will speak whats on my mind and tell you what i believe in.      People are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else. I have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and etc. Like i said i have never came across a book that i think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course i don't read a whole lot either but the books i have read i have never came a crossed any that were terrible.     Books that have like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, them can be pulled off the shelves, but if you have a child in the library they shouldnt even be in the adult book section anyways, they should be in the kids book section. I have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf. Most authors are smarter then that, or at least i would hope so.      Music is a whole story its self. In my opinon if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music then don't let them. I know a lot of music that is bad and that i would never let my children listen to it but i know well enough if i don't want them to listen to it them i'm not going to play it while their around. I grew up around rap music so thats all i listen to, but when i have kids i know what they will be able to listen to and what they wont be able to listen to.      Movies is the one that i have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as, @ORGANIZATION1, and book stores they just put out movies for EVERYONE to see and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called. Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves such as all the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' movies. The name of the movies aren't bad but the movie its self is not for a child to see so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it?      Magazines and etc i don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do such as 'playboy and play girl' but they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them only adults can. The only way a child would see them is only if you point them out.      I think i've said all i can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves. I havn't had a lot of experience but maybe that's because i don't have kids yet, i guess i will find out when i do have kids. I happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know	3	4	3
4346	2	I don't believe that any certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc; Should be removed from the libraries shelves, because any thing can be offensive. What if someone needed to resourch about the @NUM1? Well they really won't be able to, if all the books about @NUM1 were taken off the shelves, only bacause someone found it offensive. Now days, everything is offensive to somebody.      For this, people need to understand that it is what it is, and if you were not appart of that problem, then what do you need to worry about. This day and age is evil all around the world. There are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offensive. Just like all the earthquakes around the world, I know that there is some people offensive about that, but what if somebody was in college, and they wanted to learn more about what happened, so maybe they can get a group of people, and make there lives better.      People are hurting and I understand that, but us people are not here to judge, we are here to help the poor, and the sick, get by with what they have, and just help them see that there is a way out. With all this said I don't believe that we should remove the books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves in libraries.	3	3	3
4361	2	Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, weither we take it away of not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of releaving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression.      Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hid such things from their children. this makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hid it, the more children will seek it out.     In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. it releaves stress, rage, and shows this so that @CAPS1 is a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagion someone truly angery in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will parish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' @CAPS1, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him.     In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story. allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie. It puts intrest into the material.     Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But, it applies foreshadowing, intrest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Something that intersts them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab promote and keep some within it	4	4	4
4363	2	have you ever think about why teenagers are changing each day? sometimes parents don't pay attention why is that happening, because they think their kids are wroging up or because they need more freedom or even because they need more time.  when the time pass they stop and think what happend to my kids why are they changing to much? but they don't know why we bahave like that. you have ti stop that, because we are changing because of what we see on magazines, movies, and books, and also music; sometimes music have offensive words that we learn.                but also music, books,magazines, and movies are good, but when they don't have offensive words or bad things in it. sometimes they affect us in a good way but the majory of the time they affect us in a bad way because we learn bad things. sometimes little kids read books whit bad and offensive words.          i remember when my friend and I were @NUM1 years old she started reading books with offensive words, and her mom got mad at her. after that she started insulting her mom and calling her names and her mom was feeling bad, but she didn't know why her doughter was acting bad. the next day i went to their house and i told her mom that she was reading bad books and watching movies with offensive words, and i told her mom where she was hiding all thoes books and movies.        when she got home i was there and her mom had all the books and movies on her hand and she give me a bad look and she told me that i was a bad friend because i told her mom, i started crying becuase she make me feel bad but she didn't know that i was doing it for her on good.           before i move to the @LOCATION1 she went to my home and she said 'I am sorry because i treated you like that', and i told her that i did it because i loved her and because she was like my sister since we were little. we started crying; now we still best friends. this days, little kids now everything and it is because of what they watch and see.            you can help us by taking all of the bad words and offensive words of the books, movies, and magazines. help us to became someone important in life.	3	3	3

4399	2	There are certain books that no child should ever read but in some libraries they don't care whats on there shelf. They don't care if a little kid starts reading a book full of cusswords and other profanity. As long as hes reading thats all that matters to them. Even though in libraries there are kid sections that doesn't mean he can't walk over and grab an @CAPS1 book or what ever he can get his hands on.     When I was little I was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language. We even thought it was funny when ever the book had cursewords in it cause we would just repeat. I remember in school even books the teacher would read to us had cursewords and we would all laugh at it, even the teacher thought it was funny. But if we ever repeated that word while not reading it we would get sent down to the office. Even though we thought it was ok to say just because we read it out of a book.     I do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf to where a kid can grab it. I think its fine to have cursewords in books when there in junior high but elementary school is to early. Those books are meant for adults only cause some books sound better with cursewords in them. My parents thought it was wrong when I would bring home a book from the library and it would be full of cursewords or slang. But they would never say anything to the library cause they know that I will be hearing these words all the time when I get older. Those are all the reasons why I think books with curse words should not be handed out to little kids.	3	3	3
4407	2	What do you think about them taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive? Everyone has a different look on it. It is an important thing to think about. Just stop and think do you want your child looking at that when you are not around? Many would say no, because they are to young to know about stuff that shows to much and other reasons also.Taking all the ones found offensive off the shelves would be the best idea for the case of young teens, and childern.     I believe that they should be taking off the shelves, and you have to be @NUM1 or older to buy them in many reason. The biggest reason I think they should is, kids under the age of @NUM1 want to look cool like the older teenagers, but really don't need to see that. With the young teenager think they need to do things like the stuff in music, movies, to be cool and think if they do that they @MONTH1 look cool. Young teenager don't think about what they are doing, and just think it ok because the older ones are doing it and they see it. With magazines, and movies, and music they need to be of age to buy. One big reason to believe that they should be taking off the shelves is because, a lot of kids and young teens thinks they can go in anywhere and look at things that are found offensive. There are a lot of different types, and you have to be of age to go into some places.With believing that they should take them off the shelves, it gives the @CAPS1 a fill free about your child to look at things without think about the offensive ones.     I hope with reading my persuasive essay, I hope i relate to someone about the books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive can relize what i'm talking about with young teens around the ages of @NUM3 and if you take your child with you and they see something like that. With the a stuff  I gave you it helps you see the out look on stuff that is offensive on the shelves	3	3	3
4414	2	The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I.      I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age.      These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times.      When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1. This book was a fictional story taking place during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out.     That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it.      From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over @NUM1, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc.     In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion.Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is.	4	4	4
4422	2	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 the way we feel or think, but can it be to graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others.     Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that invovle a great deal of violence. Childrens mind's are like sponges, which means they soke up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning to everyday activities.      If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by @ORGANIZATION2 and in every song one of those four key topics comes up.      Like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' ect. and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on @DATE1 or @DATE2 break. Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them.     Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being. We do have the freedom and the right to @ORGANIZATION1 ourselves but we also have the right to take it away if we feel it is endangering the minds of others. I think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess	4	4	4
4431	2	Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of.  What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books?          My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it.  I think they should have a childrens section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem.  If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them.  That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that there parent wouldn't approve of or allow them read.     If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it.  Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf.  They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want there children to see it because there children would need there permission to check out the book anyways.     I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or there parents would not approve of	3	3	3
4433	2	Be a parent or responsible child  if you are against censorship. Censorship is really unavoidable, and it should not be an issue. If you dont want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie then just dont watch it. Myriads amount of people avoid it every day if they dont want to see it, and many people do read and watch those bad types of movies. It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to. Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly.      One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read. but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted. It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well. However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction. Also it teaches good @CAPS1 that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today. I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world. If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion. Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves. The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best.     Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life. It keeps them going on a regular day basis. You never know what somebody enjoys doing. If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious. If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed. It is not alway a ferocious topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access. Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes. However if  you do,  supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from.     The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested. It also teaches oodles of information. Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books. I have personally learned most of my @CAPS1 from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them. When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive thats fine. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either. If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it. Let people make there own decisions. If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you. Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'. With that being said dont avoid the inevitable.	4	4	4
4438	2	Book @CAPS1          @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I dont think @CAPS4 book's,magizines and etc. should be taken off the shelf because. Book's help people read and concentrate. In my case the more book's the better and these book's have been here to keep us occiupied. Without them we would have no bref discripson or what happened in the past. Book's have alway's been here to support us and every story must have some fun detail. Without book's I don't know what we would be doing without them.                                                                                                            Book's have been the greatest thing in my life and @CAPS5 hurts for us to know that you wan't to get rid of them after, you made us read them when we where kid's so what is the point of getting rid of them when we got this far. In magizine's there's lot's to know about our people and how we live. We have gotten this far to go to the top. At least when we do read we know how to do some certain things For instance, do you remember when you were a kid and you alway's hated reading but now, a whole new change went into your life and you now know what to do. My fravorite book I have ever read was the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 was inapporite but @CAPS5 also had meanning. We have to keep these stories alive and im not going to let you take the thing we love to do away.               I love book,s and I hate to see them go away. these book,s were here when we were kid's and we have to keep the lagacy up. Reading is the best thing in life and @CAPS5 helps clear our mind's. Thanks to reading I was able to explain to you this much and how supportive I am with these book's. @CAPS5 would devestate our country,states,cities,school's and reading clubs so please don't remove our book's thats all we ask and not only will you make me happy but you'll make our reader's very happy. Thank you for reading this and have a nice day	3	3	3
4454	2	Well people should be able to get whatever they want if there an adult kids should not but what can you do. It wouldnt be right to take away things that people like.	1	1	1
4481	2	Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship the people who rent or buy the items should. The @CAPS1 has an idea of what is offensive but they shouldn't be able to make that decision. If the @CAPS1 wants buisness they should try to make sure the customers are happy. Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants.     Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc. The different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all. If the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the @CAPS1 and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items. A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the @CAPS1 or people claim them to be.    Another possible solution would be to jus rearrange the area's of the books into to main category's such as offensive and none offensive, and then break it down into their specific categorys. So the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the librarys opinions and then go on from there. The surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the @CAPS1 to it's online website. The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off.     Now the @CAPS1 needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. So if the @CAPS1 feels that a book is offensive they shouldn't have the right to censorship. All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now. Think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the @CAPS1 in the first place.     So in conclusion the @CAPS1 should have know right to censorship books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have. This would cost time and money which they don't have. Customers could possibly stop comming in because of the change which would be a loss of money. Now everyone knows a big loss of money could hurt any buisness and possibley bankrupt them, or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover and no buisness wants that. So the easy way to make sure that doesn't happen jus leave everything the way it is	3	4	3
4498	2	Have you ever read or listened to somthing that is so disturbing that you wonder how it even got the right to be published? Well, music, books, and magazines these days are full of garbage and innapropriete thoughts that children listen to and base there life off of. All of these resources that kids can find that has this kinda of material in it can be found in libraries. We have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources.     A library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place. If a kid in school comes through the hallway saying he found a really good book, other kids become interested in it; they find out it has drugs in it and they assume that this is not a boring book like all the others that you would find in a library. Then, more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out. Now, all these children with these popular books consider themselves 'cool'. So, these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book. This leads to disaster.     Music can be the same way. Music that has been recorded in the past ten years pick up sexual references, drug usage, and innopropriete behavior in its lyrics. Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in there masterpiece? Well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies. So, every artist of any kind of work is puting these references in there books or songs. Now, singers are starting to make music videos which not along sings these lyrics but shows them as well. Children see these artist in these videos with attactive mates, lots of money, and living the 'perfect life'. So, this person try doing the same thing this artist did to make there life more like theres.      Movies come along then, movies have seen the ratings go up on these kind of styles, so they start puting them in there film. Now, all these pieces have this garbage in it and has had it in it for quite some time. How do we get it out? How do we get our children to stop getting these resources? No parents want to walk around and hear there children saying these things or doing these actions. So libraries have to have some censorship on there work; there work should be removed so minors wont get the wrong message.      What ever happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art was a special talent and was not looked up to as somthing that would get our children into some trouble? We need to get these censorships in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are	4	4	4
4507	2	WE ALL DON'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DO NOT WANT YOUR CHILDREN GETTING HOLD TO THE CENSORSHIP OF BAD BOOK, MOVIE, MUSIC OR MAGAZINES. PARENT DON'T WANT TO COME HOME AN THERE CHILD LEARN A NEW WORD FROM THE NEW BOOK OR MOVIE HE/SHE JUST CHECKED OUT FROM THE LIBARY, OR READING A MAGAZINE FROM THE LIBARY. IT MIGHT MAKES YOUR CHILDREN ATTITUDE CHANGE PUTTING BAD INFLEUNCE ON YOUR KID BECAUSE OF A TRIP TO THE LIBARY. SO THERE FOR THE CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE A SECTION WHERE THEY PICK OUT THERE BOOK AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CHECK OUT THE CENSORSHIP BOOK.                                                                 WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN BE MORE CONVINCED ABOUT THIS TOPIC.	2	2	2
4509	2	I think that everyone has there own opinon in what they listen to,what they watch, and what they read. I belive that the some stuff can change out of the world. not from people's offense or not because there will be none left too sell if people had there points of being offensive because everything is offensive to at less one person would be offensive.     I think they need to get rid of things that causes the weak minded people will do if they see it and have it in there mind and go do it in real life getting rid of the things that can get the weak mind in trouble.     I think that every that we can change what we see or hear and change the world, and thats what the world needs to change on what we could not think of before.	3	2	3
4519	2	@CAPS1          @CAPS1 a day where there are no books in the school library. A librarian walks through the now empty corridors, reminising of the days before censoring, before everyone told her of what they found offensive. Everyones ideas are different, but that absolutely does not mean they should have everyone else comply.      Saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up. Just don't read it! By pushing to have the book taken out, they would be implying that they know best, and usually, they don't know best. A @CAPS2 could be offended by a fashion magizine in the library @LOCATION1 simply has an advertiziment for a body wash. She @MONTH1 say something like '@CAPS3 child shouldn't see things like this,' then demand it be taken out of the library.      Does that make sense? I didn't think so either. In addition, if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library, then another man or woman would believe they had the same power. Censoring could become a casual thing, and books could be thrown out daily! Now, that's only on a small scale. @CAPS1 if they actually took this up with higher authorities. That book would be taken away from all schools in the @LOCATION1 brings us to this problem. Should we, as people,as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read? The answer to that is a definate no.      Let's look on the other end of this now, too. What will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned? As an example, I'll use @PERSON1. What would happen to her if the series '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' were banned from schools? Also, what about the kids that like to read? This is just taking good books away from the students...Because someone didn't believe in magic and threw a fit about it.      That librarian from the beginning is leaving now, theres no more books to check out, bring back, or read anymore. The kids have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and are then still discouraged from reading because the material wasn't proper. This shouldn't happen. Books do not need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't ruin it for everybody	3	4	3
4526	2	' Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people @MONTH1 find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem, i have only been to the library around @NUM1 times i generally rent movies. there are people who can noot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books movis and music, but at the same time there are people who absolutely love it it's their thing.      I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to. some people will say well its vulgar well the people will say that its a master peice or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines. Now music nowadays can be down right vulgar and disrespectfull, it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang related violence which has become a large problem with our children.  Libraries generally have old school music like michael jackson, The @CAPS1, and slow jams like @CAPS2-kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitatfull minds. I believe that they should not pull it off the shelfs but i do believe that you should have to be a certain age to acess these things.'	3	4	3
4528	2	Everday hundreds of people visit your local library. The library offers and array of things such as books, music, movies, magazines and newspapers, but what 'limits' does the library have about the content of those things? All sorts of people go to the library. I go to the library, you go to the library, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, siblings, we all go to the library at one time in our life. Different crowds of people have different interests that @MONTH1 offend others. The question is, should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries?     Limiting or censoring the mass media we have in our libraries would nearly empty them. Truth is, someone, somewhere is going to take offense to the items in most libraries; you can never please everyone. Also, some of these topics could be used for educational purposes. Take anatomy books for example. While high school and college srtudents use these books and diagrams to study, some mothers many find them inappropriate for their young children to see. This is why libraries have seperate sections for different audiences. There could be a childrens section, a 'tween' section, and an adult section to help with this issue. Also, everyone has different interests. I, personally, can not stand rap music but my sister loves it. Eventhough I find some of the things they say in those songs offensive it is my choice to listen to it or not. The song writers, singers, publishers, and authors who write this material have the freedom to do so. Who are we to tell them they can't write about sex, drugs or murduer because, face it, those things are part of our day to day lives. If children aren't seeing these things in libraries, they will eventually come across them else where.     Should we remove 'offensive' material from libraries? No. If we do that there will be no books to read, no movies to watch or music to listen to because everyone will take offense to sometyhing.	4	3	4
4532	2	There are books up and down the shelves in the library that @MONTH1 make people wonder @CAPS1 they are up there.  People @MONTH1 stand there and stare at a book and ask themselves, '@CAPS1 in the world is this book here?'  @CAPS2 many people @MONTH1 not know is that every book is in the world for a reason.  Books published are in the world to teach about history, manners, literature, or they could be made to take you on an advantage.  Of course you @MONTH1 come across a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to someone, maybe even yourself, but it is there for a reason.     I once read a book that I found in our school library that was about slavery.  It was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner.  Now some people would have been very offended by this book, because the @CAPS3 were calling the @CAPS4 all those names that the @CAPS4 do not like to be called.  But that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people.     People can go to any library, from one in an elementary school to a public library, and you will always find at least one book about the @CAPS6.  Just about everyone would get offended by one of these books, because nobody liked or does like @CAPS7, but they have to be there because of history.  People can not just take the books out because it offends so many people.  That would be like taking the @CAPS6 out of history, and that just can not happen.  If it happened, it happened, and people have to know.     Whether people admit it or not, they have ran into at least one book that has offended them.  That will happen, it is almost natural for it to happen.  But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf.  Those people know that books teach us, and we need books to know @CAPS2 is possible, @CAPS2 happened, and @CAPS2 might happen.  Books are here for a reason, and they need to stay	4	4	4
4541	2	There are many works out in modern times which can be considered provacative or offensive. Some are even unfit for young eyes. There are many reasons that some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I believe that no one, politician or artist alike, should have the right to put down someone else's work.      There are definitely books in libraries that wouldn't be dreamt of being checked out by the ordinary person, but these books should not be put down. I don't believe that a person's work, which is instilled with hope, money, beliefs, and elbow grease should be removed from public. No matter how offensive or wrong some @MONTH1 be, it is their work and their time, and their heart and soul which they put into a book. It is the truth that this has been done in the past to keep down rebellions and shifts in power, but nevertheless, I still disagree. For example, even today @PERSON1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is illegal to even have in @LOCATION1. This is for a specific reason, of course, and not a bad one at that, but I believe that this book should still be available so people can read and learn from the past.      As it has been for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to be remembered forever, and many people put their soul into the book they write. These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one is to remove free will and free thinking from society as well. This is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS3 @NUM1. This book is almost prophetic in the descriptions of future society from the perspective of a person from the @DATE1's, and almost totally accurate as to what would happen if one was to take books out of society, and was even censored itself for a long time. Of course, it conveys the extremist view of censorship, and probably won't happen in the near future, at least. It is, however, a dark omen of what is to come is censorship is freely given power.      There are many views that one can have on a single topic, book, or idea. That doesn't mean, however, that if it is viewed as wrong it should be put down. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books alike. If one removes these from society in any form, then at a raw standpoint, they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society. If censorship is given free reign, even if it is simply over the 'extremist' or 'radical' ideals, then people will never have the full ability to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future, which will simply be history that will be repeating itself. Of course, it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please. Once one is proven to be a threat or menace to the public, then they should most definitely be taken into custody and convicted of their wrongs.There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be upheld, but it should not overextend its boundaries.      Censorship, as a whole, is a helpful process for the benefit of the public, but all in all it removes the ability to see the raw, cold truths of life. This keeps some from ever learning how to be safe truly, and how to think and believe in their ideals. When politicians step into the boundary of art, music, literature, and even education to an extent, and try to keep it from flourishing as it naturally would, then something must be done. I'm not inciting a rebellion, but I truly do not believe that politics should rule over the artistic soul of the average man. That in itself is how society becomes self-destructive and loses its concern and connection with the world	5	5	5
4557	2	Censorship in media has been around since the beginning of @ORGANIZATION1. Some of the first movies were seen as too offensive and never made it to the theatres, but books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries how do they even need to be censored?          Censorship of books should be if a book is not for children keep them away from it. Books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library. A library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment and those very offensive books do not teach learning or are entertaining.          Music is another thing. Most songs out are highly offensive and should be in a different section. They should not be in the kid's area for music because do parents really want their children to learn cuss words at the age of five? Most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether that had to with sex, drugs, and cussing, all things that are censored in the media today. Maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored.     Movies are almost the same as music because it potrays mostly what music has in it, but it is visual. Again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear. Libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library. They should be censored by putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing or put the bar over the person's hand or wherever when they are making an inappropriate gesture.     Over the years it has become harder to censor magazines. Magazines are impossible to censor, unless you are the person receiving the magazine. If you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive. The libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines.     If you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question.	4	4	4
4558	2	Yes, I believe that certian materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less intrest in. Materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves.      For example, someone, by accident, @MONTH1 stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials. They could take it home and begin reading it, and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them. That really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they could begin losing customers.      Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is, children. What if a young child was wondering around a store or a library, and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it? That young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see. But, it does happen. Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be. They would most likely do everthing they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach. Children deffinately do not need to be seeing those things and also, even some adults do not even prefer it.      Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves. It @MONTH1 be against some religions to read inappropriate materials. And with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and very upset. That could turn many people away from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials.      In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended. This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, because they can offend many people	4	3	4
4560	2	I do not really read books. I think that offensive things sould be tooken off shelves because there could be a sene if they are'nt. There are many people who will fight if they are truely offended and it is not a pretty sight.	2	2	2
4561	2	I believe if i worked at a library , if I found multiple idems that  has profanity, rasicm, slang.I agree with taking Magazines, @CAPS1, Music books, @CAPS2 books ,etc., I wouldnt want my own children going to the library and finding books with racism, etc.I would like to inspire more people to check out library books but you could'nt if there were inappropriate books .     If i worked at a library and I had to scan all the books to make sure the books were okay for young adults, young children to check out. How would it make you feel if I didnt do a book scan to check the books and one of your children brought home a inappropriate book how would you respond to it?    I would do a observation on all the books that we had in our library. I also think that all libraries should have more inspireing books and cartooon , and baby books for little children. I think if majority of us all went to the library and we found a bad book I think we should have the right to remove it from the shelf, not only I would'nt want my children to see i woul'nt want someone elses children to see. This is how i feel if my child picked up a bad vulnerable book.I would'nt let he/or she go back to the library until they organized there library.     Lastly I think librarys should have a big room full of little kids books. Also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for @NUM1 to @NUM2 year olds and on up. I hope this inspires you .Always read the back of a book before checking it out of the library because you never know what the books going to be about	3	2	3
4567	2	Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on @CAPS1 shelves.  They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read.  These books are known as '@CAPS2 Books.'  @CAPS3, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not.     In the novel To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive.  These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel.  The author is not claiming that she personally feels that @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as @PERSON3 or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way.  The novel, To @CAPS4 a @CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of the @CAPS10.  Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many.     The novel, @PERSON4 in the @CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager.  The author, @PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters.  The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school.  To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters.  The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations.  These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, @PERSON1.     Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries.  Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well.  In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them.  It should be remembered that it is the @CAPS3 responsibility to censor materials for their children.  Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence.  @CAPS1 patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences.     In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries.  Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public.  If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the @CAPS3 or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries	5	5	5
4569	2	Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life. Maybe its politics; it could be a sports team. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. As for reading materials, the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear.      Opinions of some books and media type materials are biased. People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library. For instance, let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library. The grandchild picks up a self-help book and starts to read. Later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents. To the grandmother, @CAPS1 is offensive.      Through observation, I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book' and reads a little of it, they tend to put it right back where they found it. It obviously isn't hard to do. So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it? The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. If you don't like the music, don't listen to it. If you don't think it would be a 'nice' movie, don't go out and see it. If the magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it.      @PERSON1 said it well, that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement is as true as any statement could be. What would be left? Everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive. Therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves.      Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive, why fret over it? It's just easier to move on and forget it. Ignorance isn't all bad	3	4	3
4589	2	The library is a very sourceful place but there are just some things that should not be displayed or made veiwable to the public. Some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place.     First, there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library. What if some one looks up or check out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone. That person then could end up using the information for the worst. Everything that's in the library is not appropriate for all ages.     Next, there is a lot of offensive things you can find in the library. So things should be censored so one one ends up gettin hurt. The librarian or any one whos in there @MONTH1 never know what someone looked up or is planning until after it @MONTH1 happen or a problem is started. Therefore blocks should be put up for things that maybe be harmfull to others.     Finally, although people @MONTH1 feel it's no one eleses business what they research or check out, they should think, it is open to the public and anyone could easily see or go back to what they were looking at. Its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of some one. People have to think the library is open to children and elderly.     In conclusion, there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library. There is hurtful and inappropriate things that should absolutly not be allowed. Most important a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what some one looks up, checks out or even says.	4	4	4
4590	2	I say tht they shouldn't take off books that are found affensive and im going to say why I think that.I think that they shouldn't take off those books because thats the way it was written, and if the person that finds that book offensive then just don't read it.Another reason they shouldn't take it off its because a author wrote it but im sure that he didn't think that a person was goin to find it offensive.My third reason they shouldn't take it off the shelf its because the book might be really good and interesting, except for tht one person that thinks its offensive.I just told y'all why I think they shouldn't take the book off the shelf just because one person says so.	2	3	2
4591	2	All of the materials in a library shold have to be check out of the library before anyone can take them out of the library. Which the librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. the topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library.     Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, ect., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly senice the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library.     If you do not check out the materials that lis in the library nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. Which, if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and noone can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait til the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be check out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library.     If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, that means that noone will be able to check it out until it eithers gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the lmaterials because you lost the libraries copy of the materials that you check out. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore thay can only sit in the library to reas the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes. Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it the the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyon that wants it so the check it out.     These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library. There is alot more reasons you hve to check out materials from the library. So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that is in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library when ever you want it	3	3	3
4593	2	Yes I believe certain material should be removed from the shleves at a library if they are offensive! because people dont want or like to go to any public library that is open to anyone, let them come in and @CAPS1 some book or etc offensive to that person.       Like a child grabbed some bad unapropriate book and his mommy found him reading it so she wasnt to happy and left. t @CAPS1 that could be offensive to anyone particular. Their are certain books, magaizines, etc that dont need to be in the library. Becasue the public doesnt need to @CAPS1 stuff like that in a public library.           By the way someone that could think that certain book in offensive could report that certain book or etc if it is offensive to someone that is irregular at that certain public library. So watch what you bring or put in a public library it has to apropriate to where all the publics that walk in to any nice library.     Being offensive, is not a good thing because you want to be able to walk in a nice public library and be relaxed not startled by any none reasonable book or magazines or etc that should be there.      Music is a big problem with people being offensive about it because theres so many unaproperiate, bad language music around here that they have to watch what they put in the library ecspecially for the little kids, seniors too.      Books are material that should be fun or interesting to read for people, not for people to look at or find on he shelves a offensive book or magazine because thats not what the library is for, its for going there relaxing and finding a book or etc to have and be good with, or checked out to use somewhere else	3	3	3
4659	2	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.     I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.     If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.     A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it.	3	4	3
4690	2	Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.      Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it.      Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. @PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could.      Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out.      In conclution, @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser. @CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read	3	3	3
4696	2	Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc. People have differnt views on differnt things.     Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too	3	3	3
4716	2	Do you agree with me that we should be aloud to read, listen to or view what we want? I think it is unfair that the schools have the right to tell us what we can look at the right is ours this is america and we have the right to do what ever we want. I think we should have the choice to read it and if it is offensive then dont read it becuase it might be offensive to you but not everyone thinks it is volgare or rude and obsene.      I am asking you the paper to stick up with me and fight the school and tell them what they should be aloud to read because it is not right to censor good material just because some nut job does not like it.     That is all i am asking for is for you to stand up and back me up in this war on censorship.	2	2	2
4719	2	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3.      Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. @CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do.     Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book.      If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring. Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials.     In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, @CAPS3's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from @CAPS3. Do you really want our society to prohibit intelectual thinking just because they think certain material @MONTH1 be offensive? Think about @CAPS3	5	5	5
4723	2	When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction	4	4	4
4732	2	Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more sensorship in libraries but we can not always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You @MONTH1 never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just sensor them.      Censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book.                    People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves.      Instead of banning the books or complaining about it them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it.     You @MONTH1 not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure	4	4	4
4737	2	I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed.     Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed.     With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed.	3	3	3
4757	2	I believe that if that book, music, or magazines  that is offensive and people don't like it then maybe they should remove themself from the librarie. tThere are alot of things out there that people like to read and listen too. mmaybe for those people who do not like it they can go to an other librarie. There are alot of them around us.      If a person did not like what they seen at that librarie then why go back? It could be offensive to some people but not all. So if people try to fight about removing them then the people that like them are going to be mad because they like to read it and they have a good time. Like i said before if they do not like it they then there are plenty more librarie's that probably will not have it there.     Libraries should be able to put what they want on their shelfs. They could put in it in the back and whoever wants it and go ask for it. Or they could go put something up and make it where you know whats over there and if you do not like then do go in. There is more then just one shelf in a librarie, i you don't like it then don't go over there. If there is a sign up then there will be one reason for you to go over there and get all offended and complan about it.      You got to think about other people in this too. Peolpe that do like it and go to the libraries to read books, listen ti music, rent a move, read magazines, they be able to do it anymore. Then they will be mad and then that just an other fight. Would anyone what that much drama, I wouldn't. That would be to much for me and hanle. People are  now these days. No one will know what i person would do if they don't get there book, music, movies, or magazines. How would you feel if you lost that? Probably not to happy.     I believe that that books, music, movies, and magazines should stay on the shelfs of the librarie. Just becuse a few people don't like it and want to fight for it, should really sitt back and look at what they are doing. There are more then just one librarie in this world. If you don't like the stuff that librarie is putting on it's shelfs then go find a new one. It's not worth fighting over and spenting all that money on that not alot of people have these days just to fight about what is on a librarie shelf. Not even worth it. Like i said before you don't like it. don't look at it, read it. listen to it, nothing. Just stay away from it and you will not get offended.	4	4	4
4762	2	What if some one found your favorite book offensive? Inapporate materials do need to be kept from young minds of children.On the other hand, you can not sheild people from things they should know or already know. Everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves but an another person @MONTH1 see no problem with it.     Children need to be protected from materials that @MONTH1 hurt them in some way. Children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and cop harmful things they read . Bad influences can be even magazines with famous celeberties being caught breaking the  law or doing bad things and young minds see that as 'cool' and @MONTH1 try to follow tha example.     Children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, television and even at school than in some books. Children need to be protect but, you can't baby proof life. They willl be introduced to plenty of bad influnces in there life time but, it should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things. Kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just setting at home.     Libraries are places for use public and the public covers a wide amount of different kinds of people and someone will always find something bothersome with somting or another. People have different views, believes and religions, and, books on these might be offensive to some but, the life style of another. Like The  quote by Katherine Paterson, said if we take off the shelves every book or material that somone finds offensive there will be no books in the libraries at all.     Yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people but, they should have a right to be read if their is someone who wants to read them. It is not the librarys job to be prejudice against certain books for because someone does't agree with it. Books should be a wide varitey like the people who are reading them. Also children are protect from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices	4	4	4
4765	2	Books are very important to our society. They hold a special place in our hearts, and contain much of our world's knowledge. Everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books. I definetly agree that little children should not purchase a book that has explicit content in it that they should not read. However, some people, myself included, have checked out or bought books and then realized what exactly was portrayed in those books. I do not believe that anything that contains certain contents should be removed from the shelves.     I can think of many books that could be taken offensively that are still on many school library and public library shelves. Any books about the @CAPS1 and even the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, such as '@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' can be taken in the wrong context. These books do contain language that is not appropriate for children. But we do still see them on our shelves. Why? Because those books, and many others, are very important to us.     Books should stay on their shelves because, as Katherine Paterson cleverly put it, '... And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS7 means that if everyone took out books that they felt were personally offensive then there would be no books. Books are vital to learning things. We put all of our knowledge into them, even hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. When the libraries in @LOCATION2 were burned and/or destroyed, we thought our knowledge was gone forever. Thank goodness for the back-up system that no one had known about out in the @LOCATION1.     I myself have read the @ORGANIZATION1. I believe it whole-heartedly, but I do know of people who do not believe in the @CAPS8 and have taken some things that are said in the @ORGANIZATION1 to be taken personally. I believe that the @ORGANIZATION1 is the most important book in the world. Without the @ORGANIZATION1 no one would know of the wonderful things that our @CAPS8 above has done for us, and what he is doing for us now. However, some people can take what the @ORGANIZATION1 says to be offensive in regards to homosexuals and divorces. But would we allow the gays or divorced men and women to take the @ORGANIZATION1 off of the shelves? Of course not!If we would not allow them to take off that ever so important book, then why should we allow to have other books to be removed?     Books are so very important to us and our world. They hold our world's knowledge, and they also hold our hearts. Just think about what our world, our knowledge, our society would be like if we did not have these precious things. Can you imagine it? I cannot. Books are one of the most important things that we have in @CAPS7 world. Just because someone finds something offensive in a written work does not mean that everyone else will, too. Books, if they are offensive to anyone, should be kept on our shelves for our future generations to come so they @MONTH1 learn and grow on our knowledge of our past	4	4	4
4769	2	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship.Different sections in the libary should be offerd.Everyone has differnt oppions on what they like to read or watch.You should do what you want at your own risk.I think the censorship should not affect the libary.      The libary should offer differnt sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side. The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group.The kids should not have to worry about censorship becuase they should not be offered any thing that an libarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the libary.     A teen side should not have censorship because alot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much.Books that teengers read are most likely to have foul language and inapropiate things. Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influenece them as much. Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known?   An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything.Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the sheleves.. They already know of allot of things. Why get rid of books that others @MONTH1 read. It is a libary so it should just offer things that would increase intellegence not decrease it.     The censorship is pointless, you should do what you want at your own risk.Things in movies,books,magazines are that are of the world. Why try to block out negative things when there all around you. If someone finds something affensive then let it be there are many things affensive in today's society.You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out.You enter the libary at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection your going to choose.     The libary is full of differnt oppions and allot of differnt likes and dislikes.If you should not be looking at something then it is your oppion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys differnt things like, movies,books, magazines, and music. If the libary had a censorship they would loose allot of matrials all due to oppions of people that did not care about others oppions.Everyone enjoys differnt things and wants a wide varitey of the things they like. The libary is where you go when you need  books, movies, and etc. Why close someones oppion of  book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read.     I believe that the censorship should not affect the libary.The libary should offer differnt sections  for certain age groups.The books and magazinges and music at the libary should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has differnt oppions at the libary. The censorship would be a bad decison if they did go through with this decison.. The libary would not offer as many things and most liekly less things would be getting checkedout. Therefore I do think that the cenosorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries	3	3	3
4776	2	I do believe that  book, magazines, music, movies and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf.  If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think what is books, magazines, movies, music and etc., for and why are they on the shelves for if you can't read, listen or watch them. Book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed. Music should be listen to and movies should be watched.     The reason why I agree with the fact magazines and book should be taking off the shelf  is  because they were made to enterain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention. Another reason why I  think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classrooom book you  learn different thing like math, you learn about the history, or you learn about different  thing in english class.  Magazines and books were made so that  different people can  take it off a shelf  and look though it even if they only want to look a pictures if it has picture.     The reason why I think music should be taking off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, @CAPS1&@CAPS2, gospel,or @CAPS1&@CAPS2 and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person life or what goes on in their heads.Music can inspire people in different ways.Music is apart of life and most people in the world like to listen it different people that inspir them.     The reason why I think movies should be taking off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched not just sit and let in movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different thing, such as become an actor also. Movies tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored.     To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books and music off the but put them back so that other people can enjoy they thing you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies and listening to music nad reading magazines and books can help people in life and @MONTH1 also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run. Ya'll be suprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening and watching.	3	4	3
5984	3	The cyclist was riding through a tower when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert. In conclusion the desert is hot.	1	1	1
5986	3	The essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit describes a mans bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the mans journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. As you can see the setting makes this mans bikeride very hard.	2	2	2
6031	3	The narration of Rough Road ahead a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June. To disappointed the truck stops water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal.	3	2	3
6037	3	Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town	2	2	2
6046	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isnt much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback.	1	1	1
6047	3	The features of setting  really effects the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather, it is hot, it will slow the person down. And if its perfect that will let the person go at regular speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy that will slow them down. And if its smooth that will speed them up. See, it really does depend on the condition.	1	1	1
6048	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1	1
6051	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty . I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding	1	1	1
6054	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1	1
6058	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the town had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this town is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1	2
6081	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2	2
6095	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this mans journey he was confident in his abilities. I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "	3	3	3
6106	3	The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him feel sweat a lot. The narration states, Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt (@NUM1). This caused him to drink water until he ran out. The narration states, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips (@NUM1). He then had to suck on pebbles which he could have choked on. The narration states, With any luck Id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat(@NUM1).	1	1	1
6117	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Tis better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing whats going to happen next.	1	1	1
6152	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill... This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2	2
6154	3	The setting of the essay efects the cyclist because he got lost when he ask for directions from old people!	1	1	1
6159	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years.	2	2	2
6172	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story Do not exceed posted speed limit. The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states,  a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit  sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die.	2	1	2
6178	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritaed toward the old men. Ten this essay, old men give the cyclist direction, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy. However he showed realy become himself for taking their advice, and motuising a credited map on real directions.	2	3	3
6186	3	In this I will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. One way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water. The next was is the misleading old guys that gave him ba directions. Another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down. The last reason is the snake that slowed him down.	1	2	2
6192	3	The features of the setting that the author cyclist through definitely effect not only his mood, but his the physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in the high deserts California in June, @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches rolling hills which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the authors change in mood.  	3	3	3
6201	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says the sun was beating on me this shows it was hot. Thats one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated.	1	2	2
6217	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirtier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid, so thats how the setting affected him.	1	1	1
6221	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow. Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more  energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him. Because the setting of the story was in the desert the cyclist was affected more then he had thought he would be.	2	2	2
6223	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who havent seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldnt have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldnt have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his dehydrated state. I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldnt focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldnt get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2	3
6225	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, This sight is troubling,. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult. The land at first was flat and easy to ride, as it got harder to bike on, the cyclist grew @CAPS1 wary and delievious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, had an enormous effect on him emotionally."	2	3	3
6236	3	The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting. At first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a ghost town. He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait. The bikers feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did.	2	2	2
6237	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned @PERSON1s Grape Juice factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets old timers and the give him a shortcut to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their shortcut. While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. It dint really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2	2
6243	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.	2	2	2
6277	3	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water he slows. Another is the directions from the old men that probably arent up to date nowadays.	1	1	1
6288	3	The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit, affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was traveling through the high desserts which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state. From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into A far like substance The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.	2	2	2
6305	3	The setting it the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit in three ways. One way is that it is very baren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down the the cyclist body which adds to his dehydration and lack of to focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death.	3	2	3
6311	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees. He struggled for water but couldnt find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had ""a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. This means it was hot and couldnt find water."	2	2	2
6327	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.	2	2	2
6342	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a shortcut that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination.	1	1	1
6364	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He cant say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him hell die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and thats like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3	3
6378	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.This place might have been a thriving little spot at time say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.  	3	2	3
6386	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.  From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2	2
6394	3	He race trying to get yosemitre for some rushing river	1	1	1
6405	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2	3	3
6448	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the ghost town and bait shop he says, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 	2	2	2
6468	3	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleists main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The author wouldnt have been so dehydrated if it werent so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldnt have been any conflicts.	2	2	2
6472	3	In the essay Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest Mule greet me.there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.	3	3	3
6476	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions	3	2	3
6478	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesnt find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.	3	3	3
6481	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.	1	1	1
6483	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement I was travelling through the high deserts of California. not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement I was travelling in June. @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also had the flavor of battery acid. This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly. The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.	3	3	3
6495	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay A sea worry , because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says my son body-surfs. He says its his job. That quote was explaining that hes a body-surfer & its his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	1	2	2
6500	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1	2
6512	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he cant collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he cant find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesnt help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2	3	3
6518	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didnt know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6536	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. If you arnt prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill, the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.	2	2	2
6541	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, Id be fine. Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool. 	2	2	2
6552	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haventh confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.	1	1	1
6566	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the town The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, Gary and Wilbers Fish camp (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3	2	3
6580	3	In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldnt have taken the old mens advise. He explains that It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.	2	2	2
6588	3	The feautures of the settings affect the cyclist if it is just between buildings and cars the cyclist won't be able to break free and bicycle freely. So it can affect him.	0	0	0
6596	3	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to Gary & Wilbers fish camp, he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''	2	2	2
6611	3	The features of the cyclist is rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, amount of water. The hills give you a breeze going down but going up give you a hard time. The snakes can hurt you by bitting. The heat could make you sick. The amount of water can really hurt you by being dehydrated.	1	1	1
6625	3	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.    	2	1	2
6646	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you	3	2	3
6651	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.	3	3	3
6673	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark trainy, there arent going to be ??? running outside. If it is snowing, the ??? are not going to be swimming in the water.	0	0	0
6675	3	"In Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist by making him doubtfull. The cyclist is doubtfull that he wont make it to Yosemite National Park. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction. This shows how he is doubtful. Finally in the story the cyclist doesnt think that they will make it."	2	2	2
6685	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didnt have any more water also, there arent any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill, this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy.	1	2	2
6692	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he cant go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop hes relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didnt really know where he was going because there wasnt a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first town as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and hes only 12 he knows that hes not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2	2
6694	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, hes looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, hes becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that theres no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.	3	3	3
6696	3	"It cant be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me. @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered. If  these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster."	3	3	3
6709	3	In the story the author says, The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state, This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, with any luck Id hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat. The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water.	2	2	2
6719	3	The features of a setting can affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, while he was riding in the hot sun he became very thirsty because whe only had a few drops of water left. That is how the setting can affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6724	3	In the story, Do not exceed posted speed limit, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish.	1	1	1
6728	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."	2	1	2
6733	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates.

6739	3	"The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2).

6764	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entilled, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text , when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a  ridiculously large snake crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. Also in the text, when, over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view, hope was replenished into the cyclist.

Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who havent left the confines of their porches sinse carter was in office.

6777	3	"There are many features in the story, ""that affect the roles, like out of waters, bad directions. The narrator is ??? and says, ""the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips.. it is say that there is hardly any water left , and he still have to keep going on, until he can find some In the story water is something he has to over come because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store."	1	1	1
6808	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.	1	1	1
6824	3	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.	1	1	1
6831	3	After reading Do not Exceed Posted Limit I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. that mood was replaced by short, moving hills. The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, @CAPS1 can feel so cruel. There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job	3	3	3
6836	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they dont want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.	2	2	2
6839	3	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up the road the cyclist has @NUM1 miles befor he gets to a town he could run out of water. If he run out of water befor he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesnt make hisself sick. When he gets to the town he can get more water.	1	1	1
6872	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..       "	3	3	3
6882	3	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.

6904	3	Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from old timers the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; thats extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasnt really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didnt help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldnt have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. 	3	3	3
6915	3	In Joe Kurmaskies Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1 the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldnt worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldnt have been so worried. Whats interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldnt have struggled so much at the end. At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  	2	3	3
6918	3	In the story Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit a cyclist is faced with many problems. Its really hot out, practically a desert and its in June. Just knowing that makes me want some water. Also this cyclist is running short of water and still hasnt got to the place he needs to be. The roads are hills and bumpy which make it harder for him. Those are the problems this cyclist is faced with.	1	1	1
6944	3	In the story Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aernt going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying It didnt really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you.	2	3	3
6956	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he coudnt.	1	2	2
6967	3	"In the essay Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldnt hold in the lamest mule. This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2	3
6968	3	The authors setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclists location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since hes traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a persons body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3	2	3
6975	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him. In the essay it said ""No Town"" but without a town theres no water and water @MONTH1 lead to dehydration. It also says something about flat roads turning into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. Those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.  "	2	2	2
6976	3	The setting affects the cyclist becuse it is the passes is on a road much alot of hills it would affect him as being tired, or if the biter was in a place where the cold or hot it would affect him or his temp. and by his attiude.	1	1	1
6984	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.	1	1	1
6988	3	In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I dont think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2	2
7008	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were I was going to die. First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilbers Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.	1	1	1
7010	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist also saw a ridiculously large snake. There was also no signs of civilization for miles. There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1	1
7052	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
7053	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didnt have much to drink until the next town. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3	2	3
7067	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says havent gotten off there porches since carter was in office. I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.	1	1	1
7068	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1	2
7070	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1	1
7087	3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, Id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didnt take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map.	3	2	3
7093	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.	1	1	1
7096	3	The setting in the story Do not exceed posted speed limit reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havent left their porches since carter was in office.(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers shortcut and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says Yes, sir! I own a very good map, and Id always stick to it in the future. The cyclists message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.	2	2	2
7107	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes ghost towns, abandoned buildings, and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of dropping dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson hell surely abide by: follow the map!"	3	3	3

7122	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."	2	2	2
7141	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office."" So that means he dousen't know were he's at."	1	1	1
7142	3	In the cyclists journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. The second is that because the information wasnt true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. This made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. Those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist	2	2	2
7143	3	The setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map. He should have packed an extra bottle of water. @NUM1 not take any advice from people that havent left the porch in years.	2	1	2
7150	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles	1	1	1
7152	3	The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they dont have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.	1	1	1
7160	3	The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they cant and they shouldnt do this or that such as the sign of no entering or one way. Second, its limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldnt travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  	1	1	1
7171	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. Its only him. At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake  it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions.	1	2	2
7182	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind. This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, battery acid, that he wouldnt last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 	1	1	1
7193	3	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks  are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story.	1	1	1
7199	3	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.	1	1	1
7202	3	In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclistis affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew travelling through the high deserts of California in June his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite would be to devastating	1	2	2
7210	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time.	2	2	2
7214	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see any thing for miles and you are running out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you dont know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me. 	2	2	2
7226	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got of cause, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was ruunning out of water. This was making him dehydrated. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that. When he saw the fish bate shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved,    	2	2	2
7228	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
7238	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. It also says, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.	1	1	1
7250	3	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from hi/her performance for example, In the essay Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted SPeed Limit the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has. Also, the lack of the people in towns give the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate. Third the weather in the essay has a great deal of being affected on the cyclist it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride.  	2	2	2
7253	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist by hurting his ability to keep going. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from very old man who had out of date directions. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally he finds a store and then dehydrates and is on his way again.	1	1	1
7264	3	"In the story Do not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	1	1	1
7265	3	While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. telling myself that if I could make it that far, Id be fine. @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait. At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map.	2	3	3
7266	3	In the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an Ghost town with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he	2	2	2

7333	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills (kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and eneegy, especially for bike riders. high deserats of California in June (kurmaskie @NUM1) shows heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to heat overheated when exerting much force at once. These two co	2	2	2
7337	3	The terrain the cyclist faces dont help very mach considering he is almost out of water, he came across hills that ticed himout a lot & made him even more thirsty. Also, when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didnt have any energy left after all of that he wouldnt have been able to get to the baits shop.	2	2	2
7353	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, ...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 it was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, the sun was beginning to beatdown... @CAPS1 it is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, ...it fit the traditional definition of ghost town. There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He might have died from dehydration. I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out. There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist. @CAPS1, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty.	2	2	2
7357	3	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California  made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one.	1	1	1
7377	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts dont have much water which is what he needed and he couldnt find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him.	2	2	2
7379	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion.	1	2	2
7384	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story.	1	1	1
7389	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit, the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says The sun was beginning to beat down. This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 	2	3	3
7414	3	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!	1	1	1
7418	3	The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she caldnt go as fast, The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph, so that affected his ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going. For example, I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldnt cool down. @CAPS1 how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist mind. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump. The desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function.  	2	2	2
7420	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didnt seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. He didnt know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride.	3	3	3
7455	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadnt taken the shortcut that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.	2	3	3
7473	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	2	3	3
7484	3	At first the terrain was fine and he confident. But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghoust towns in the movies. The next town didnt come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert no water for miles. But he stayed determind. And he made it to some water though.	1	1	1
7496	3	The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady.	1	1	1
7508	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. the long hill is one example the snake and the dirt road are two more. The heat of the desert is another and his depleting water supply are all examples of features that affected him.	1	1	1
7520	3	With no one around and rough road ahead not to mention dehydration the cyclist begin to feel he was going to die. Because of this he began to dout himself but each time he saw something he tried to get there.	1	1	1
7521	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to short, rolling hills. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed crippling, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.	2	3	3
7522	3	Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name. He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid. He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self, sometimes life can be so cruel, he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.	2	2	2
7533	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey.	1	2	2
7534	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, rundown @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk.  	3	3	3
7541	3	The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks its only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there wouldve been no one there to help.	2	2	2
7557	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. had to go through a hard time in the California desert.  It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling he had to use more energy and ???.	1	1	1
7586	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the towns around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. 	2	1	2
7593	3	IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist sees the sign that says, Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit. So the cyclist has to be cautious	1	1	1
7628	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, through the high deserts of California in June. This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder.	2	2	2
7648	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.	0	0	0
7652	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it. With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.	2	2	2
7660	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that havent left their porches since Carter was in office. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who havent left their homes in years.	2	2	2
7673	3	He is going on a journey on his bike. He has to go down hills and deal with the factt that has has no water. Thats basically what the setting is about.	3	2	3
7679	3	In the story Do not exceed posted speed by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink.	1	1	1
7700	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.	3	3	3
7704	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.  	2	2	2
7706	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says hes in Lodi, California on a gorgeous day in June. Its very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke. Also, he is in the middle of the desert , where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more ! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist.	1	2	2
8870	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.	2	1	2
8904	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. Narrator says A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden @CAPS2 is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also says, Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now, @CAPS2 proves that the geese symbolize @CAPS3 home also.     	2	2	2
8910	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she wont pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point.	1	1	1
8916	4	"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent. @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."	0	0	0
8920	4	I think the author wanted to express Saeng when she took a vowed and to express the way he felt. When the statement was made that also I think it was to make readers feel interest in it but mainly to help understand.	0	0	0
8926	4	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back	1	1	1
8934	4	The author is saying that shes not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.	1	1	1
8947	4	I think the author concludes the story with that ParagraPh to say that he will @CAPS1 uP in sPring time when the snow melts and geese return. Also I think that the author like the setting of sPring also to see the sunny skies a geese floating in a @CAPS2. I also would like that setting because It gives me more ideas and it's a very lovely setting to be around. That is why I think the author Picked that ParagraPh to conclude the story.	0	0	0
8957	4	The author concludes the end; of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tommorow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test.	2	2	2
8959	4	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didnt want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life.	3	2	3
8963	4	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you dont know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.	1	1	1
8987	4	The author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings. The last paragraph is saying she will re-take the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and gives her comfort. Saeng hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of her home and give her strength to pass the test.	2	1	2
9001	4	@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1  All are reasons why the author conluds the story with this When They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddng, Then I will take the test again. First @CAPS2 because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again. Also because when she remember her grandmother it upsets her so that definatly takes @CAPS2 and the human will power to do her test a second time. Next memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesnt want to ever forget them. But again goes back to the will power or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last All the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother  ment to her and threw all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out she saw and wants to honaor or apreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph	2	2	2
9012	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently because she is thinking about what had happen a long time ago with her mom, the plants in her garden. Saeng was thinking about when everything comes back how will it be with the return of Spring, when the snow melts how will things be, the geese retorning and she will take the test again, that is what She was vowed silently to herself about. That is how i thik the author will conclude the story with this paragraph included wit it.	1	1	1
9021	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime.	2	2	2
9032	4	The author concludes the story with thise paragraph so that we buy his comming book, or so that we get more exited.	1	1	1
9037	4	In the story, Winter Hibiscus, the author concludes his story with an odd ending. when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself,in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again. I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her drivers test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home.. I believe that this is showing that she still didnt consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       	3	3	3
9045	4	The authour meerly states the obvious within this story of shortness. This exerpt mainly mainly means that when spring arrives she will return to the Green house or area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girllwill atempt to act the plant that grews wild in her home country and bring it to her new home.	0	0	0
9046	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think hes trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again	1	1	1
9062	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus the author minfong to ends the story as she does for many reasons.	0	0	0
9077	4	The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author knows its bond to happen again. I know this because in that paragraph it says in the spring.I will take this test again. She is just preparing herself for next year. This is why I think this paragraph ended with the story.	1	1	1
9093	4	He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. I guess there poor in one way. In conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.	1	1	1
9104	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."	2	2	2
9105	4	Why I think she added this is because she needs time to grow like the plant before she takes the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test. going through school teaches more than stuff we need to know it helps us grow up, and how to understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader that I understand life more than I did in first. She still has a lot of growing mentaly about her past and preasnt.	1	1	1
9107	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that while this particular tale is over Saengs life will continue. The paragraph provides closure for the reader as well as explains that in time Saeng will take the test again, once she has further adapted to @LOCATION1 culture.	1	1	1
9161	4	In Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.	3	3	3
9172	4	The author conludes her story with this paragraph because it really shows the heart and the perseveriance Saeng has. Also it tells a lot about her carter and ends the story in a strong mood. That is why she ended the story the way she did.	1	1	1
9185	4	The author concludes the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring then she will try to pass the test. So say that if at first you dont sucede, try try again. Also the author concludes with that to show that Saeng has been in the @LOCATION2 for some years and that she still misses her home back in Vietnam.	1	1	1
9218	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to tell people that shes going to take the test again and try. Shes going to be like the flowers but she needs time so when they budd she will.	1	1	1
9227	4	The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saengs hope is restored. Throughout the story Saeng is sad and misses her home. She feels hopeless in this new land, the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of her being at home with her grandmother, which makes her want to be back at home. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home. The hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to just strange land.	2	2	2
9242	4	The author finishes it with this because spring time is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test she wants to start over in the spring like the flowers do. To know that the hibiscus will grow back though now it is dying. For spring to come is a time to start a new, where babies are born, flowers are at blom and a new beggening is forming	1	1	1
9260	4	The author concludes the story with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her.	3	3	3
9264	4	In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her drivers test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph.	2	3	3
9273	4	This saying is saying that the snow has already fallen down onto their garden and when the snow melts, they will have to recrop everything again. This is a perfect conclusion to end this story. The story is talking about how the flowers grow in the spring and how saengs mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden. So since it snowed and their would be a while before the spring come back. Saeng has alot of planning to do in the next spring. The hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return.	0	0	0
9275	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because show that she will go back to the one place and will not break down like that and grif over what she has lost and have to deal with change.	1	1	1
9288	4	The author concludes the story Winter Hibiscus  this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds. The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom.	3	3	3
9308	4	The author ended this story with this sentence because its a good conclution. Its a good conclution because it closes by telling what she will do. This is good  because it shows that Saeng had finally realized that she needs to take that test even though she likes nature so much.	0	0	0
9311	4	The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.	0	0	0
9321	4	She end, the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were every where, she had to buy this one. She planted it so it can grow through winter. After winter the flower gets huge and she passes her driver test. For reward her mom get her a real Vietnam flower.	1	1	1
9332	4	The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.	2	2	2
9333	4	My response is that if is about winter so realy it is going to be about witer walking around having fun and all them thing.	0	0	0
9342	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has tear stains and puffy eyes as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test.	2	2	2
9344	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things	0	0	0
9353	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus, I think that the author concludes the story in when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story	2	1	2
9363	4	 The  author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the authors life will bloom again. Overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph.	2	2	2
9365	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story Saeng thinks about native plants shes seen before are now in @LOCATION1. She sees how theyre adapted to life there, like in the way the hibiscus can survive the winter. Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home. She doesnt necessarily need to adapt to survive, but to be successful. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its growth cycle) she will restart too and retake the test.	2	3	3
9391	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didnt have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."	2	2	2
9420	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her. At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to bloom. @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to bloom. 	3	2	3
9428	4	"I beleive the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, ""and this hibiscis is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldnt change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her drivers test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again, I think Saeng didnt have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing.  "	2	2	2
9434	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0	0
9437	4	Saeng was taking a test and she didnt quite pass it She was afraid to tell to her mother but she has to tell her anyway. Her mother got upset because she didnt pass it. Saeng knows  that right after winter's over, Shell be taking that same test again and she hoped she will pass it this time.	1	1	1
9440	4	I think the author of Winter Hibiscus said when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again. to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isnt giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way.	1	1	1
9454	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.	0	0	0
9457	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too.	2	3	3
9471	4	The author concludes this paragraph because he wants to make it more clearer so the readers would understand It more. And so he could, make it better to stand out. 	0	0	0
9480	4	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.	1	1	1
9485	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrarator is now willing to accept and adapt to her new environment like the flower and the flower would do. Geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter. Saengs comfort tone is in @LOCATION1 where she has many childhood memories; including her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is used to the flower being in a warm environment. So, when the geese come back in the spring and when the flower blossoms again, she will be ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life more and take her drivers test. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in @LOCATION1 which she misses very much. After these things come to try and adapt to @CAPS1 ways of life. 	3	2	3
9487	4	In the passage winter hibiscus the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph when they came back, Saeng vowes silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. I believe she concluded this story with these words she change because she is saying to you in that means when the birds flewaway. Even the bird seasons would be back like always. An example of this is when she says the birds eased into the hibiscus. Mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do. This what I get out as the last paragraph are the story winter hibiscus as what it means to me.	2	1	2
9502	4	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.	1	1	1
9538	4	Saeng and her mother have to be determined to try their best in order to survive. Saeng and her mother has been thourgh a lot and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before, The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought oF how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends disagree with the taste but it doesnt stop her from enjoying what she loves most.	2	2	2
9547	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time dont be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesnt like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.	1	2	2
9550	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is Finally comfortable with her new home. After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saengs old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says in the spring, and the geese return that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldnt grasp new ones in her new home. The authors use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping  her pain and becoming  a real part of her new world.  	2	3	3
9551	4	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope winter mothers understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country .The author, Minfong Ho, gave personification or humanizing to non-living things to the story. This is why the author used the last paragraph then why she did.	3	2	3
9552	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saengs determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when shes in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.	2	2	2
9554	4	"The @CAPS1 why the authoR concludes the story saying, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRselF, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese REtuRn and this bibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The authoR ended it like that, because Saeng basically saying time will come FoR heR  to take that test and she will past it with belieF in heRselF,"	1	1	1
9562	4	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam	3	3	3
9564	4	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because aint going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That quotation explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	0	0	0
9566	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1	1
9589	4	The author concludes the story with When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, to show that she will try again with a new start. When she sees the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a You what? hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.	2	1	2
9598	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back, then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus remines Saeng of the flower back in her home country this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now."	2	2	2
9611	4	The Hibiscus is budding means that the flower was growing. That is a flower with lots of bright colors and nothing else can beat it. The reason another flower cant beat it is because that flower represents so much thing and it is one of the most natural born flowers around.	1	1	1
9633	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the drivers test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.	1	1	1
9636	4	Saeng is not comftorable in her sorryndings, and has not addapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and choses to go buy it, because it reminds of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home  her mother seems shocked at first by the price saeng had paid, but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses @LOCATION2. Sheang says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1.	2	1	2
9641	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.	2	1	2
9654	4	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didnt do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he dont want people to think that she just worries about the plants.	1	1	1
9694	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.	1	1	1
9699	4	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were strange before [and] had become familiar to her now. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.	2	2	2
9709	4	I think that the author uses this quote, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again. @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother? BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone. @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 	3	3	3
9734	4	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.	2	2	2
9739	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, Its flowers arent pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season It shows that saeng realized that the new place that shes leaving right now is almost the same as their old home  In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be  strong and follow the flow of life.	1	2	2
9746	4	I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he dose and  it is a good reason . It says that since she failed this year next year when it is time to ready up the garden she will tell again . That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed   because even if you fail you are not losing any  progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully  make the light bulb he simply said  I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb . So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story.  	1	1	1
9763	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0	0
9775	4	Because to her it is the best time to do things cause all the happy memories return along with the geese and hibiscus.	1	1	1
9780	4	"The author of Winter Hibiscus ends the story with the paragraph when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesnt want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope."	2	2	2
9822	4	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland. In this way, shell always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place.   	2	3	3
9825	4	The author includes this  because hes using metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saengs personal life is	0	0	0
9838	4	The author probably conclude the story with that paragraph b/c she is basically relating the plants to herself meaning as the plant bloom she will too by taking the test. and her reason could be b/c or is b/c reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author but this to conclde the story...because she was comparing herself ib the geese and does as they did 	1	2	2
9861	4	The author: minfong Ho, finishes the story like this to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesnt eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as main character and the last paragraph is used to link them.   	3	2	3
9868	4	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.	2	2	2
9878	4	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show shes going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example the story says Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance. Almost as if she doesnt find it that bad as she thought at first it being different and not her home and where she was used to being.  	2	2	2
9880	4	The Author of Winter Hibiscus ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant dies in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.	2	2	2
9912	4	"The auther conclude the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and uptill then vow silently because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam there were many beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the flower shop to get a peice of home. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind. This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this and needed hope, so al waiting till spring when the hibiscus will bloom again that will give Saeng a sense of home which will give her hope to do good on the driving test. "	2	2	2
9924	4	The author conclud the story with that because as winter come every thing goes away. Like the trees lose the leaves the geese fly south and the flower die off. So this passage is saying in the spring time when every thing comes back she will start the test again. it is like to start a new life back over.	1	1	1
9931	4	I believe the author ended the story with the test because it is a big part of Saengs life or part of her tradition.	1	1	1
9935	4	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1.	2	2	2
9962	4	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when. the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ""The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back."	1	2	2
9977	4	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.	0	0	0
9979	4	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.	2	2	2
9990	4	The conclude the story this way because he can now expand on this story creating a sequel about Saengs success. Also be ending the story this way the author is showing now a limit Saeng is and now she will stop at nothing until her test is complete. Saeng is having difficulties adapting to her new lifestyle because the plants and the previous luteries that she had are no longer present. In the story Saengs determination is shown when her mother finds out that she spent @NUM1 dollers to have a simular plant. The mother responds by saying their whole garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollers.	1	1	1
10000	4	She will go back to where she started. Its a circle and she will be back the next year where she began.	0	0	0
10001	4	NO IMAGE	1	1	1
10007	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not prepare for this test, because she was not accustom to the place, but after seeing the plants that reminded her of home, and knowing that the spring time is when more will blossom, she will be ready to take the test over.	1	1	1
10009	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take thattest again"". To show that Saeng is going to take the test again and is not going to give up. This is shown by saying, ""then I will take that test again"". This shows that she has not given up and wants to try again.  "	1	1	1
10013	4	I think the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed. But, she knows that she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article it says many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become.. almost familiar to her now. This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she then gets hope from it. Also, I, think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph.	2	2	2
10015	4	The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her. Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom.	2	2	2
10027	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. Its just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. Thats the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  	2	2	2
10029	4	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.	1	1	1
10031	4	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and new chances for the main character. The future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth & another start from the cold, hard winter. The author takes this to heart including, more events which enhance this symbolized meaning. the author has uses structured choice to carry her toughts. Recreate, when to convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like ""the gesse return"" and ""take the test again"" which add to the importance at the home. Also, the literal action of the ""hibiscus is budding"" @CAPS1 rebirth. In winter the plant is dormant & less colorful, but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through about color in its buds. The author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph."	2	2	2
10050	4	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again. The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.	2	2	2
10067	4	"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences. SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did."	2	2	2
10076	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again.	1	1	1
10086	4	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. 	1	1	1
10093	4	The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sence of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair. you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart whereever she goes. The text states that, it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her @CAPS1 Malik flower, as a sence of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test.  	2	2	2
10096	4	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.	1	1	1
10112	4	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.	1	1	1
10119	4	The would grow some flowers and water the geese come back to her pond.	0	0	0
10127	4	"The author of Winter Hibiscus included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""Its-its not a real one, Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto. The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now. Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."	3	3	3
10133	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because hes saying that once winter and springs over and the hibiscus is budding, then Ill start over again and try again. The author is saying saeng cant wait till spring so she can plant her own little garden. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1	1
10160	4	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story Winter Hibiscus, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, .. in the spring... its the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. Its letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  	3	3	3
10188	4	The authar concludes the story with the paragraph they because it shows saeng determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts saeng had right after her test it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, Here, let me help you mother,she offered (HO). With her mom comforting her and telling her it is @CAPS1, gives saeng the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she cant let just one thing hold her back in life. the support saeng has she will definetly pass the test the next time.	2	1	2
10191	4	The author closes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. Even though it @MONTH1 not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. But how could you? You know how much wewhat happened? when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her mothers inkling of disappointment, Saeng wants to try again.	2	2	2
10192	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1	1
10210	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement simply because, mabe he is trying to send out some sort of message to people and get their attention The author also could of concluded the story off with that statement because mabe he Just felt like he need to do that, mabe he didn't have a particular reason for doing it.	0	0	0
10214	4	At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.	2	2	2
10223	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesnt like the change and would like to go back to her old home	2	2	2
10241	4	When they came back ,saeng voed silenty to herseif in the spring when the snow melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again .in the story the author put the  paragraph in his story to show what the  girl was doing to improve on her grades.	0	0	0
10243	4	"At the end of the short story, winter Hibiscus, the writer Minfong Ho includes somewhat inspirational concluding sentence when they come back  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. I think this sentence was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so greatly with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. as Saeng narrates in deeper detail.

After all this sorrow, by putting in a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future.    "	3	3	3

As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saengs promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didnt give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     	3	2	3

In the story, @CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasnt given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you dont know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way.	2	2	2

10564	4	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengs eyes now swept over her (Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger.

This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character."	2	3	3
10591	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the Madagascar periwinkle growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  	1	1	1

The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she."	2	2	2
10630	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line .. Slowly fading into the distance. Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line  Through the quiet repition of season upon season.. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it.	1	2	2
11838	5	The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tells you about his parents; the selflessness and the way they put their kids first before themselves really just makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden  red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in.	1	1	1

To see that his parent made something out of notthing. The author parent show him with their life, and his teaching have been the basis of his life. I feel the same way because my parent brought me here for a better life. I think you learn everything from your parent How to act and all that. So yea the last sentence he said I liked it.

Narciso tells how his parents turned a house into a home."	2	2	2
11897	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was ""solidority."" because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their non culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me to today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" also in paragraph @NUM2 it says.

You see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them. with their kitchen as the ""heart"" (happy heart) cuban music fills the air/ (which he adores). this is just a verry uplifting story how he was born into a cuban, Spanish, Italian people dealt with racism and his parents are welcoming in their extended big extended family  into sleep eat everything. this is a good family and like he said family is not about being blood related its about loving them the way they come and still be in their homes. their family is without a worry all about love and courage his parenths taught him something special and how you can have more than a blood related family. All you need is a little selfishness and alot of courage."	2	4	3
11905	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relatives.""The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing."	3	2	3
11909	5	The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate. Also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out. He also considers his community family and that really makes you feel at peace inside.	2	1	2
11918	5	"I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."""	1	2	2
11924	5	"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be I believe love. I said love because basically throughout the whole story all that was being talked about was ""eternal @CAPS1"", ""a dore"", bonds, and unity. The family are imigrants and they came looking for a better lifestyle in a foreign country Just for the benefit of the children. From my point of view only loving parent would give up The country they all love in order to do something like that because they had to leave behind families, friends, and careers. Now their facing cultural hardships over Just one desition."	1	2	2

11943	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez, his own memoir, his own memoir, we are told about his child hood. Narciso affects the mood by describing the setting. He writes ""could afford to into a modest three room apartment..."" in pharagraph @NUM1.  This gives you a humble feeling from the very beggining of the reading. In pharagraph @NUM2, he writes ""passionate Cuban music filled the air..."". This made me think of mexican culture. Narciso writes things like these throught his memoir. These lines give the mood of modesty and rich Cuban culture Narciso also writes about his birthday, and faimly. The parts that he writes about faimly give you a feeling of unity. These are the lines/phrases Narciso uses to give his memoir mood."	3	2	3
11944	5	In the memoir, the author creates a mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood. I say this because that author is talking about how he is grateful, or thankful, to his parents for teaching him things and for bringing him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close.	2	1	2
11945	5	"The author created a sense of love and care in Narciso Rodriguez. The author talked about the sense of family and how people don't have to all be the same to become one community. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it explains ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immagrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 shared the feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one ""family"" in a rascist enviroment. @CAPS1 shared how his parents made the difficult decision to move to the new place leaving loved ones behind for their children's better future (@CAPS2 @NUM2). @CAPS1 showed a lot of admiration for his parents based on what they do for him and how they always have other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals. In @CAPS2 @NUM3 @CAPS1 says ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir."	3	4	4
11954	5	"The mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness. The way that he describes his parents hard work and love is incredible. First, it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" This demonstrates love beond comperashin seening as they had to start over from scratch steping down far benith there potential to care for their children. They never gave up but instead kept going to try and give there children a better life than they would have had. Also this memoir expresses togetherness not only in the famley but in the community as a whole. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2 "" Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants"" @CAPS1 even though they were of all kinds of races ""It was a close  knit community of honest hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessary their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) This was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite raise. His parrents also kept their doors open and alowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet. Knowing that they would do the same for them. This takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throghout this memoir that illistrate the mood that the author creates of love and togetherness."	4	4	4

The authour is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about; yourself, memories, family and etc. A reason why the author created does moods because a home is were a family live's together and were they hold memories together which shows loving. For example in the memoir, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Which is obviously the mood of loving, because there all a loving family together. A second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places. Even though they all werent the same the acted as a family and were united. For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united. A third reason why the author created does moods because the author's parent's werent just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children. For example, ""They come selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life."" Which means her parent werent just caring abalt them but the future for there son. The whole story is based on home and family but the thing is that a home and family will always share the love, caring and unity of one another."	3	4	4
11964	5	"The mood of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is @CAPS1 much the same throughout the whole excerpt.   In the story, the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed. Narciso talks about his family and how much he loves them and what they have done for him. It says in the story ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 much throughout the story, this is the mood.       Another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is thankful to his parents selflessness. In the story, Narciso says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too.     Narciso Rodriguez creates happy moods for us by the way he writes with love about his family and how he cares so much about what they did for him."	3	3	3
11970	5	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is grateful and happy. First, @CAPS1 is very grateful because @CAPS1 says ""...To give their children a better life"" His parents gave up what they were doing in their homeland Cuba to come live in @LOCATION1 to make a better life for their child to start off and live in. @CAPS1 recognizes this but, @CAPS1 also knows @CAPS1 can never do enough to thank them. Next, it says ""family has nothing to do with love relatives."" @CAPS1 is very grateful and thankful that @CAPS1 grew up in the neighborhood @CAPS1 did where everyone was treated like brothers and sisters and they all felt saf in their community that they created. Also the story says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 knows that it took a lot of heart to do that much for someone else when all it did for his parents was make their lif tougher. They had to start over and that is what made him most grateful for his parents. That is what I truly think the mood of the story is."	4	3	4
11979	5	"The author creates many woods in this memoir. Firstly, a mood that the author sets is warmth. Figuretive warmth. For example in paragraph @NUM1, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home."" which is a perfect description of some thing that makes you feel warm inside.Secondly, another mood the author sets is compassion because he talkes fondly and with compassion for his parents. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the knd of jobs they desurved... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Which @CAPS1 very compationate and full of emotion.Lastly, a mood I think the author sets is acceptance, because his parent were so willing to take in people that werent always blood related. for example in paragraph @NUM3, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Which States that they were very welcoming and accepting people.These are the moods the author created in this memoir."	4	4	4
11994	5	"The mood is happy, proud, and grateful. Happy because he loved his family, his culture, and his home. ""In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso was proud and grateful to his parents because they gave up everything to come to the United States to give their family a better life. Without knowing alot about this new country, they struggled to overcome problems. Narciso is grateful to his parents for living their life to start over. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""	2	2	2
12001	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was like hapeness and he had a lot of emotion. Because he really loves his mother, and father and his baby sister. There is lots of emotion because Narciso talks about how he lives were he lives and how long he lived in a one-room apartment. The hapeness part is When he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home that was realy a happy and sad memory.	1	2	2
12035	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy. I think there is hapiness because of what it says on paragraph @NUM1. ""In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS2 that mean that there were a happy and friendly family. In conclusion, that's the mood I think the @CAPS1 created and some reasons why."	2	2	2
12053	5	He/she makes you try to be sad, I dont even know if this is real but it didnt work.	0	0	0
12059	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. The reason I say that because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. ""And for which I am eternally grateful"". ""They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life"". Wow that @CAPS1 alot from his/her parents they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. This is the reason why I picked those two mood in the memoir!"	2	2	2
12061	5	"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was shocking. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music."" and ""a love of cooking"" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating. Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring."	2	2	2
12065	5	The mood created in the memoir is the feeling of Cuban culture and the @CAPS1's home. The feeling could be described as homey. In paragraph @NUM1, this is where the @CAPS1 first introduces the custom of his house. And how it is. The @CAPS1 describes his house as simple with cuban music and the scent of cuban food flowing through it. The feeling that the @CAPS1 uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had. The house kinda flooded the memior with it's feelings. Also this memior didn't only show cuban feeling it also gave of family vibes (like how a family is happy and together) It expressed how the @CAPS1 was close to his family	1	2	2
12068	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man."	3	3	3
12076	5	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt. The boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them. He was also grateful that he had house and parents like you did. He admired his parents and what they did. He will never forget growing up and living in that house. The purpose of the author was to show you how grateful someone was of what there parents did when they immagrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1.	2	2	2
12079	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful."	3	2	3
12092	5	There is o good moud @CAPS1 to this @CAPS2. the mood is a warm, happy feeling. Whenyou read the @CAPS2 it makes you feel @CAPS4. Just like being at your own home. But only a little different. This time youare reading a @CAPS2. It really explains what is going On. It als o give s alot of past information. Which I like in a @CAPS2. But @PERSON1 seemed to really enjoy being cuban. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 to really like her Cuban food. Her family was good @CAPS6. The @LOCATION1 was a bad place when @CAPS7 was growing up asa child. The reason for this is because of racism and segregation. But other wise @CAPS7 has a good life.	1	1	1
12100	5	"In 1956 Narciso Rodriguez's parents arrived in the united states and bought a @NUM1 room apartment. In 1961 Narciso was born and @CAPS1 began his life. In this story Narciso describes his childhood. The home was very likely, it was a traditional cuban home that consisted of a kitchen that was the heart of the home. Both of his parents loved to cook and listened to cuban music. Narciso says ""The passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with The aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also got a good sense of family. and it was not just those who were related to you but also those who cared for you. Although people were different (customs or culture's) they still all came together. People often came to Narciso's home and let them stay while getting back to life because they believed in doing so for one another. Narciso was extremely grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. They taught narciso about the true meaning of love and family they also created a home with memories @CAPS1 will never forget."	4	3	4
12102	5	"The mood that the author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had. The author values relationships and he is grateful to have his "" family"". He says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1""  In other words he is saying that he is lucky to have what he has, a ""family"". Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people, showing that they knew that others had less, and that they were grateful for what they had. Mood, means tone or a feeling, so the mood of this was grateful and happy."	4	3	4
12106	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood whe the author says, ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive."" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir."	3	3	3
12111	5	The mood of the story is like a sad story then it leads to a happy ending. It starts sad because the family moves from cuba to the @ORGANIZATION1. They tell on nothing about the language or the traditions. It gets happier when they moved into the apartment and they find a job to work at. Thats what the mood of the story is.	1	1	1
12116	5	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six Narciso said ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, both sacrificed their lives to live in @LOCATION1. ""In @ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in @LOCATION1."" They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is very lucky to have parents like @PERSON2 and Maria to watch over him."	3	2	3
12131	5	"The mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir."	3	3	3
12155	5	"The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" and the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends."	3	3	3
12170	5	"Fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez is a firm beiliever in friendship and family values. In a selection from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he describes the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighbor hood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows helpfulness espically in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States. Secondly, their was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house. There was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's beilieved these people would do the same thing for them in return. Finally, Narciso can not express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family put on him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have beilived that family and helping hands were so important. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness pre vails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. "	4	3	4

12186	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is. First, the moon that I think is a warm and and saying there's no place like home feeling. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship as in home and and the people around us is like family and we come and unit as friends and families. Also Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. To finish my describtion of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez theres no place like to feel at home."	2	2	2
12192	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is very sensative way. And what I mean by that in paragrap @NUM1 and @NUM2 it sound's like the @CAPS1 is getting real emotional. It say's in paragraph @NUM1 I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and scrifice.	1	1	1
12193	5	"The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside."	2	2	2
12210	5	"The mood Created by the author brought out a Cuban @CAPS1 of heritage and family. The mood set here is that family doesn't mean ""blood relatives"" it is People who need help and will have that Same felling for @CAPS2 if @CAPS2 needes that same help. The mood @CAPS3 how @CAPS2 have to go threw alot of times where it's hard and @CAPS2 will lament but @CAPS2 have to get through it and it will pay off. your culture is a part of the mood of the story. This @CAPS4's @CAPS5's came from cuba and had a one bedroom apartment raises a kid and still helped others. The apartment is turned into a cubain house hold of food and music and families. The mood elavtes and esksimtes as they spend more time more family better living space better job and most of all better under standing. The mood of the whole story really cenies around family and the true meaning of family. family is your love ones who care and help, love and respect @CAPS2, That's the mood of the story."	2	3	3
12212	5	"In this @DATE1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"",Narciso Rodriguez creates a safe, calm and secure mood. His description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 says  ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS1 just a backdrop. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close  knit community... ""and "" countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way, Narciso described his family and neighborhood, keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1. "	4	4	4
12240	5	"The author creates moods in the memoir that seem to be possitive. The first mood that is shown is a loving mood. In paragraph three is states, ""All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This shows when all the immigrants came to @LOCATION1 they would descriminated they all came together and became a family.Another mood that is created is careness. Narciso Rodriguez's parents showed so much love and support towards him. Paragraph five says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This quote shows that even before Narciso was born his parents were thinking about them. Narciso's parents wanted their child to have a good life. A final mood would be happiness. Narciso is very happy and has alot of gratitude for his parents. Narciso quotes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. By Narciso saying that it shows how much he loves his parents and how happy he is living in @LOCATION1. The author creates different moods throughout the entire excerpt."	4	3	4
12244	5	"This is the mood that was conveyed by the author in the memoir. The mood is a very happy one. The author looks back on all the good times @CAPS1 had as a kid. @CAPS1 explains how Cuban culture was a big part of his life and how @CAPS1 still enjoys Cuban food and music. @CAPS1 also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home.  In the last line @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also talks about how @CAPS1 lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world. @CAPS1 describes how even though the familys from different places had almost nothing in common they'll all became very close. In the third paragraph it says, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That quote shows how close that neighborhood was even though they came from different places. Is happy in that memoir because @CAPS1 only revisits memories that @CAPS1 was fond of. That was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir."	4	4	4
12248	5	"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

12304	5	The mood the author created was a good mood. It is a good mood because it is telling you about his life he has. He has a good life because he has good and nice parents. He is wealthy. He has no trouble like getting punished. His parents are wealthy and they have a good job. The author did a good job make this story happy and not sad.	1	1	1
12307	5	The mood in the memoir, that the author is trying to @CAPS1 you is. That it is calm, and in its own way the mood Kind of leads to forgiveness and @CAPS2. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go you never forget about your family. And that the memories are much better then the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you deciede to go, to a different Country. Never forget who gave you birth. And who loves you. Which really means family. And friends. But the @CAPS3 That they describe in the @CAPS4. He decieds to leave his family to go to america and to get an education. And do something big with his life. And he is going through other things to like, the other People are thinking of him as a immagrant. And how the rest of the family @CAPS5 leave there @CAPS6. But the family to them that really didnt mean anything to them. In there house they left there door open to any family that needs help, or that there going through the same thing as what their family is going through.

The author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir.	2	2	2
12319	5	"I think the mood of the story is being gratefull. I think this because in the story it says Narciso thank his parents for their love and sacrifice.Also because in the story, Narciso says that his parents turned a simple house into a home. Which means they were kind and selfless.And he says that ""the warmth of the kitchen of his humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."	3	1	2
12331	5	The author gave a loving mood in the memoir. I know this becacus he did not talk badily about anything and he talked about how his parents helped him and other people as a kit. in paragraph two he was talking about how his house was nice and comsortabur.

The mood first develops in the first paragraph, when Narciso writes of his parents immigrating from Cuba and being able to move up from a one room to a three room apartment. The second appearance of this mood is when the author writes of how their community came together and helped eachother through the segregation and racism of the time period. The third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what they could get and made their house, into a home. Accomplishment, is the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives""."	2	3	3
12358	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was good. Her memoir was good because in 1961 they moved to a simple house only for two-familys. with blond-bricks building in the ironbound in @LOCATION1.

12364	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is that he is greatful and happy. Greatful is the mood of the memoir because he is greatful to have many things. First he is greatful for his parents because they always loved him. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" (para. @NUM1). In the memoir @PERSON1 makes the mood greatful because he talks about how he is greatful for his friends, culture, and like I said before parents. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love."" @CAPS1 of all he is greatful to his home and where he lives and whom he lives with. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.""

12365	5	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood in the story, the author does this by writing in a certain way. One way the author does this is by writing very empathetacly. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM1). A second way the author sets the mood is by sneaking in deeper thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses. For example in paragraph @NUM2. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" A third way the author sets the mood is by speaking so fondly of their parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". (paragraph @NUM3).

They both came to the @LOCATION2 and had to work in whatever job they could find, although they deserved much better ones. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is very thankful for what his parents have done, how much they have given up in order for their kids to have a better life His parents showed him in their everyday lives the spirit of how to be generous at such an early age, and the true importance of family and friends. They didn't just ""tell"" him to live this way, they based their lives in this belief. that's the reason @CAPS1 has taken these teaching to be the basis of his life. These are the ways in which the author sets a mood of love and gratefullness in this memoir."	3	3	3
12382	5	"The mood created by the author in a memoir.

12384	5	"The mood in this memoir is very strong. Sometimes the mood is sad, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially...The barriers to work were strong and high, And my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" In this memoir the mood is also happy at times, ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author, Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir, he creates happy, sad, and many more, but his memoir ends happily, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."""	3	3	3

12413	5	"I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you."	2	2	2

Also the satisfaction mood comes out when Narciso talkes about how fortunate he is that his parents were willing to take the risk of moving to @CAPS2 to give him a better life. This showes that the love of a parent is stronger than enything in the world. Another mood is relieve. for example Narciso is relieved that his family made it to @CAPS2 sofly and sand. This article is a perfect example that family is all you have in the end and that nomatter what they are there for you.	4	2	3

12576	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he sill loves it today. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child.

12580	5	"In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first mood and most prominant mood was joy and happyness. Because throught the memoir the reader learns about the writers family and how greatfull the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyfull mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader most consider both these moods."	3	1	1
12598	5	The mood was happy beacuse most of his family immigrated to @LOCATION1. That him and his parents loved to cook. He loved the smell of the kitchen There family sometimes cooks and to visit them and eat. The auther past was unhappy because they needed to put up with racism.	1	1	1
12604	5	I think the mood created by the author was to show everyone that Narciso is grateful to live where he does. He loves his home, his parents everyone gets along. even know he's an imarant he wants to succedy and get along with everyone.	1	1	1
12618	5	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. First, Narciso's parents went through the struggle of coming to @LOCATION2 and starting over. Narciso narrates, ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" His parents came from Cuba to the United States to have a happier future. Narcisos family is nice to everyone and everyone in their neighborhood is nice to them. He explains his parents doings. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents are happy to let anyone into their home. Finally, Narciso is very grateful towards his parents. Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso is very happy about what his parents did for him. The mood of this memoir is happiness."	3	2	3
12644	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir.The humility shows when he describes how, although rich and inviting on the inside, his house was simple and ""modest"" on the outside. All of the home's warmth and comfort was crammed into a three-room apartment.The sense of caring was demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez referred to not just his blood-relatives, but the friends and neighbors whom he considered ""family."" Of his parents, he says that they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" to their community.Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph. He states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him, especially their generosity and sense of community. These three themes set the mood of this memoir."	3	3	3
12646	5	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he develops a very warm, comforting, and happy mood of where he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez tells us of how his parents came to the states and after living in a small, one room apartment for a while were able to move in to a three room apartment where he was born. He speaks of how is home was decorated in the traditional style, about the Cuban music always playing and of how his parents taught him to cook. Rodriguez also tells us of his diverse neighbor hood but of how they all came together in unity. Everyone cared for one other and they helped whoever was a need. If someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others. The memoir depicts that Narciso Rodriguez grew up in the love of his family.	2	2	2
12653	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful. He is grateful that his parents give up everything that they had just to give him a better life. In the memoir it says: ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved."" he is happy because he has an opportunity to have a better life and that he learned the real defition of family. In conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful."	2	2	2
12674	5	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1 to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and to start a new career. The mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir.	4	3	4
12686	5	"The mood created by the author is happiness and gratefulness. Reading this made me feel very thankful. The author thanks his parents several times. He talks about how he learned how to cook from his parents and says ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" in paragraph @NUM1, and in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.""I think those specific quotes from the memoirs show how grateful the author is feeling. Reading this made me feel grateful for what I have, and think of all my parents did for me and sacrificed. I also think this sentence from paragraph @NUM3 supports the author wanting you to feel grateful. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" I also think happy, because the author is looking back at his life and states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made my mood become happy."	3	4	4
12693	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 is friendship and love. When the @CAPS1's parents moved to the United States, They created a traditional home. The hard being the kitchen. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the kitchen celebrations, childhood, Friends and family formed the backdrop to their life. The @CAPS1 learned that '""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.' The neighborhood the @CAPS1 lived in is made up of many different cultures but they blend with each other to form a small comunity of honest, hard-working immigrants who help others when they themselves are in need. ""My parent's always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" The many immigrants gave up their lives in cuba to move to the US to make a better life for their children even though they did not know the language or culture. The @CAPS1 will always be thankful to her parents for that reason. There is no way to show her thanks for her parents love and sacrifice that they showed to her when she was just a child, and showing her the importance of family and friends. The @CAPS1 states ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" They didn't just change it, they did it through love and friendship."	4	3	4
12709	5	"The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few ways. One way is in paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful."	3	3	3
12710	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso is thankful for his parents support and love. When he talks about how he feels about his parents, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""grateful for their love and sacrifice"" demonstrates that through his whole life they were there for him. They didnt just tell her what to do, they showed her. When he talks about the @NUM2 lessons he has learned from his parents, he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""basis of my life"" demonstrates that they taught him how to live (the essentials to living).  They also showed him the meaning of family. He doesn't just think family is blood related, ""It was here when I learned the real definition of ""family"""" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM4). The words ""definition of family"" demonstrates that he is thankful for them teaching him what family means to them. In conclusion, the mood of this passage is grateful. "	4	4	4
12730	5	"The mood the @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood."	2	2	2
12738	5	"There is a mood created by the author in the memoir.One way in which the mood is created is by explaining how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up.Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood.A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The narrator explained how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another.As you can see, the author of the memoir created a late mood in the memoir."	3	3	3
12753	5	"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story."	3	3	3

12768	5	The mood in the story is very happy. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family not just a home.	2	2	2
12775	5	In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house.	2	1	2
12780	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful. The memoir was all about how Narciso Rodriguez admired his parents courage, selfishness, culture, heritage, strength, and perseverance.  Narciso said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" @CAPS1 also said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up. The memoir focused on how @CAPS1 is so greatful for everything his parents did and sacrificed for him. In conclusion, the mood created by the author of the memoir was happy and greatful."	2	3	3

In the memoir Narciso said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.""

The author shows how greatful and thankful they are in this memoir When they said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their Strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me With their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life.""- In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful."	2	2	2
12825	5	"There are many ways to describe the mood in ""Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez. First, the mood is family-friendly.

12830	5	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good."	3	3	3
12837	5	The mood in the memoir swifts throughout the story.  First is that in the begin Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different.  But that changed when they started having family over and also using there imagination to decorte there house.  Next is that the mood change in the middle of the memoir when they rellized you can have just a good life in @LOCATION1 then you can anywhere else.  Also, by them having there family with them while in @LOCATION1 made there moods more positive.  Lastly the family's mood was negitive when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made there house into a home there mood change immeditly and they were happy in @LOCATION2.  Thats the mood created by the author in the memoir.	1	2	2

I kind the like it a little bit because its about cuban peoples. I think my father knows People from cuban and I think he knows their culture.	0	1	0
12848	5	"In the memoir, the mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying ""In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of ""family."""	3	3	3
12854	5	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, she uses key terms and phrases to discuss the mood in paragraph @NUM1 she says, ""Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This line puts a clear picture in your head of what it would be like to have lived in that home. Another time Narciso Rodriguez puts a clear picture of the setting in your head is in paragraph @NUM2. She is stating where her parents must live and says, ""braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics."" This line puts the setting in my mind which makes it more clear to picture the home and setting. Narciso does a great job describing the mood of each location."	2	0	1
12871	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood, that's sort of calming. The author explains how the house was very comfortable for him. Narsico explains how his parents were caring and selfless all the time. I think that creates a very calming are caring mood. Also in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" which again creates a caring mood."	2	2	2
12879	5	"The mood in the memoir changes. But overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home."" Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him. ""The faith that is struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."""	2	3	3
12902	5	He was happy to be educated like he is and he was happy to be Cuban and even though his parents didn't have much he was still proud of his family because is not where you live or in what conditions is. If you are from an honest family and if they're with you in the hard moments.	1	1	1
12904	5	In my opinon I felt like his culture ment a lot to him and I felt that her house and family and friends was all important to him. In the frist paragraph he describes his family, where they lived where they came from, how old was they and it made me think about my culture and family. In the second paragraph it tells what year she was born in and how his house was and I wanted to describe my old house the only house with more memories then I could think of. His neighborhood is a close tight community with honest hard working immigrants. It made me think about how all are community could be if we was hard working. In my opinon her memories made my memories come back.	1	1	1
12907	5	"I think the mood the author set is loving. The story says how there was a love for cooking and a passion for Cuban music. Just how endless celebrations brought life in there warm home. Narciso Rodriguez also had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, although these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" How there parents always had their arms and door open to many people knowing they would do the same for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" The mood @PERSON2 set for this story is loving."	3	2	3
12911	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: Blueprints of our lives, the speaker shows many moods. The moods of gratefulness and happiness from his life.The speaker is very grateful through out the whole memoir. But the speaker is most grateful for his family and oppertunity to come to @LOCATION1. It says, ""'I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.'"" This shows that he is very grateful because he's saying that if his parents were not willing to sacrifice things he would not have been able to go to @LOCATION1 for a better life. He also tell us that his parents left their friends, family, jobs and homes to come to @LOCATION1 for a better life for their children.The speaker also shows happiness. He says, ""'countless extended family members came and went.'"" This shows he was surronded by people he loved and that made him happy. It also said that they would help people out, spend time with the comunity and have people for dinner all the time. This also shows he was happy because he was spending time with so many family members and friends.

12912	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and happy. The memoir explains how proud the author was of their parents. They did so much for the author. The most important thing was bringing family and strong relationships into the house making it an actual home.	2	2	2
12926	5	"In the memoir there is more the one mood, but this is the main one. First, the author is trying to create a ""no place like home mood,"" and the author succeeds at it. It seems he/she is using memory and telling his/her background. The mood was also very calm and very relaxing for the story. In conclusion this is the mood the author is giving."	2	1	2
12928	5	In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life of also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the poeple that live on the street. Also by how he feels so confortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family.	2	2	2
12938	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a calm and loving mood.

This shows a loving mood because the parents wanted to give their children a better life by moving to american, even though they were leaving alot behind. The author shows a calm mood when he says ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"""". This quote puts a calm mood because when you think of filling the air with scents and playing nice music it puts you in a clam relaxed mood. This quote also shows a loving mood as well. This is because it explains her love for her family and that @CAPS1 is proud to call her family a family. All in all the above evidents set the memoirs mood as loving and careing."	3	3	3

In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Family and freinds, and celebrations that encompassed them both."" This quote is relevant to my question because it shows that freinds and family made Narciso happy. In paragraph @NUM3  it States ""In the United States they had to start over entirely taking whatever jobs they can find."" This quote is releavant to my question because it shows that Narciso's family can make whatever they want out of their lives. That is the mood in the memoir ""@PERSON2 @CAPS1"" by Blueprints of Our Lives."	2	2	2
12954	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, has a very strong and touching mood.

12955	5	"The mood created by the author is fairly formal, with a few informal parts. For example a formal paragraph, like paragraph number one, sets the stage of the whole memoir and uses formal transitions like ""After [living]"". Also, the paragraph is very informative, telling about his parents imigrating to the @ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba and how they were financially poor + could not afford a fancy home like they could in Cuba.An informal paragraph in the memoir is a paragraph like number six where he is describing how thankful he is for his parents being as selfless and giving as they are.

Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.

13079	5	"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."	4	4	4
13088	5	The mood of the author changed during the memoir because in the beginning of the story he had mood of just telling where the character was from and where he was born. On paragraph @NUM1 he has a ill do what it takes mood. For example he was grateful about his parents and his life he was okay on how things were and he loved it. On paragraph @NUM2 and seven the author feels relieved and happy because he writes about the character remembering the good old times.	1	1	1
13093	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."	4	4	4

13602	5	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a very happy and loving mood. As it says in the memoir ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This means he is happy and loves his parents have done. It also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance"". He loves his parents and is happy with what they have done. The last thing the memoir says is ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This ment he was very thankful for what they have done. Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, has a happy and loving mood. This happy and loving mood is exspressed throughout the memoir."	2	2	2
13613	5	In the story memoir the author created a couple of different mood to decribe the story.      The first mood was greatfullness. The author described greatfullness tword the parents when the author was discribing selflessness caring of the parants when they made the disision to move to @LOCATION1 to give them a better life. The last mood discribed by the author was happyness. The author discribed happiness in the story when it was discribing the parents making everyone feel at home These are the differend moods discribed in the story by the author.	2	2	2
13617	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blueprints of our lives the mood is heartfilling, and about appreciction.

She focuses more on the gratitude of her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's focused on how her parents made a house a home.	2	2	2
14836	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame in order to make the frame or sturdy, there was modifications to the building's framework which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, this would not work out well. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was a safety issue one last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area.	3	4	4
14844	6	The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first concieved but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risk's and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top the Empire State Building was already a failure.       Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation. So the roof would have to be re-done in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and @NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin.       Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely Flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned.	3	3	3
14845	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, there were constant obstacles faced by the builders. Architects could not place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. @NUM1 ft dirigibles would add stress the buildings framework, therefore causing the architects to modify the framework. This would cost them an extra @MONEY1 for the modifications. The Architects don't know if these modifications will help. Safety is another concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. For example ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects also had to worry about @ORGANIZATION2 and the constant shifting of the winds due to violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down so they won't drift away, except it is impossible to weigh down the dirigible in the air. They dangle high above pedestrians walking around on the streets, therefore making it not safe. There is also the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. @NUM2 was in December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles Attempted to dock except it couldn't get close enough to to high velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."" Airplanes became the future."	4	4	4
14851	6	"The builders of the empire state buildings had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Things such as the wind, the actual docking, and the people getting off safely. The actual docking was impractical it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch.     The wind was the main reason for the fate of the mast. First the wind current was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time getting close enough. The captain of the, ""Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also even if it could tie up the back of the dirigible would swing around fiercefuly. So the builders were dealing with an impractical task"	2	3	3
14859	6	"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a facinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole ""age of transportation"" (@NUM1). Unfortunately this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. Later the architects that were building the mooring mast had discovered that their idea was not going to be fulfill. The idea had too many obstacles to overcome. The fact that ""most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM2). If anything was to go wrong, it would be catostrophic seeing as how below them were highly populated streets. Also, ""the greatest obstacle was nature itself"" (@NUM3). There was just too much wind to keep the aircraft steady and undercontrol. The reality of the fact was that the idea to moor derigibles sounded great but there are far too many risks to carry out the plan."	2	4	2
14865	6	There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long and it would be to much. There Would only be a single cable tether and it would add stress to the buildings frame. The entire Steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fullfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the Ship would swivel around. They are meant to land on open playing feilds but using these at the empire state building Where they would be dangling high above pedestrians was not safe	3	3	3
14867	6	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful. This would make it very difficult to accually get the dirigible close to the mast. Also the structure of of Empire State Building. The framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. Builders made over @MONEY1 worth of fortifying the framework. Those are some obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	2	2	2
14895	6	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 There is an obsticle that the builders had to over come. Building the top of the empire state building was difficult because the dock part of the tower wasn't stable. Also the frame of the building couldn't support the dirigible, ""dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The designers designed a new tower that was a ""shinny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside"". The winches and controlling machinery would be housed in the base of the shaft its self. They also added a observation deck and more passengers were able to wait for the dirigible. another problem with it was there was a law that aircrafts couldn't get to close to urban places. Over all it was a hard pain saking design for them and costed alot of money."	2	2	2
14896	6	"Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with over @MONEY1 of modifications. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flamable hydrogen. When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4	4
14904	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2.). If an accident like German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved."	3	3	3
14913	6	"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a dangor for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangorous for passengers and workers on the dirigible. Lsted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This goes to show that any project should be checked for safety precautions at all times."	3	3	3
14930	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof. It would add stress to the building's frame. Another problem that faced the builders was that hydrogen is very flamable. If a dirigible had been caught on fire and exploded, over downtown New York, then law suites would be made. Another problem that faced the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the winds at the top of the building. There were shifting winds due to violent air currents and these winds would make it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock. The last obstacle was the fact that there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	4	4
14932	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were long; some were as long as one thousand feet. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable. If an accident would occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated. Other obstacles were made for the builders of the Empire State building which proves that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles.	3	3	3
14963	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One obstacle they faced was that the building's frame would have to be modified. This was because the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building when docked on it. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it dangerous for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea, there were too many obstacles and dangers involved in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3	4
14970	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building caused many obstacles. One of these obstacles was that dirigibles outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen rather than helium. Using hydrogen was highly flamable. They knew how dangerous it was. In the excerpt it says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle people had to deal with was nature. In the excerpt, it says that air currents were ""violent"" and it would be very hard to control the dirigible. Finally, dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building would be illegal. It says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not dock over a heavy populated city like New York City. Many obstacles made it challenging to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
14975	6	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, engeneers fused several obstacle when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock in the @CAPS1 state Building. As stated in paragraph number nine, there @CAPS2 problem was ""the stress of the dirigiblel's load."" With all this weight being transmited to the buildings foundation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate its new situation This was verry expensive todo. Sixty thousand dollars wer nesciary.Another problem was that the blimps would not stay still while docked The winds would toss it around. A solution was putting waights at the back of the landing fields, but the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrans on the street"" like explaine in paragraph @NUM1. "	3	2	3
14987	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof for would have interfered with the buildings overall frame. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building. Another obstacle for the docking of diribles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building. Those were some obstacles that builders faced and prevented to making of a mooring mast to let dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.	4	3	4
14994	6	"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking.Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public.Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed."	3	3	3
15004	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low."	4	4	4
15029	6	"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the stress added to the building's frame when the dirigible wore it at the top of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to rearrange the frame to make it work. Consequently, the workers were never able to accomplish the goal. Safety was a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles at the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigibles were highly flammable which could have caused a serious accident to occur. However, the ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 there were heavy air currents above the building, it would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast. There was also an existing law that prohibited planes to fly low over city areas, which of making impossible for dirigibles to reach the building. As a result of all these obstacles, the main goal to dock dirigibles was not achieved."	4	4	4
15034	6	"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as safety, nature, and legislation. First, it would be difficult to safely allow foreign dirigibles to dock. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This displays the fire, and therefore safety, was an obstacle. Next, air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The air near the top of the building was affected by air currents, so it was difficult for pilots to land. Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" There was no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an obstacle. Finally, there were laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The very purpose of the moor would be illegal, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding the moor, and its opening was never successful as a result of them."	3	4	4
15057	6	During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had so obstacles. One of them were, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable, they had know idea. They did have the knowledge or technology to do such a thing back then.	1	0	1
15082	6	"The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building, threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to but a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously changed the architects designs. ""The architects desighned a shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back desighn that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" (Lsted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, the celebrated because the finished framing the entire building ""The Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety."" (Lsted)"	4	1	1
15088	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings our ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel which could very well be dangerous. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated State. The explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would lose a lot of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building under went many challenges in trying to allow Dirigibles to dock."	3	3	3
15110	6	There are always challenges when you are trying something inovative. There are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support and you also need to be structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of these archetects faced all of these. During the 1920s dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel. Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. Other than getting people to go along with the plan he had other problems. The wind is very violent at that altitude. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city it is dangerous and some were highly flamable. In conclusion There were too many large obstacles to overcome.	2	2	2
15113	6	The obstacles the builders of the empire state face was trying to make sure the building don't fall down.	0	0	0
15114	6	Some problems that the builders faced building the mast on the top of the building was that the builders couldn't just drop the mast on top of the building's flat roof because then the wind would cause stress to the frame because the blimps could hanging there. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to make the mast. The cost for these modifications were another problem for them two.	2	2	2
15115	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't @CAPS1 put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would put pressure on the building's fram. To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame. More than sixty thousand dollars' went into the modifications of the framework. The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that. The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift. In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using led weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around.	3	3	3
15117	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The reason why the builders faced obstacles was because ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" An example is ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the dirigible moor would make the buildings frame bend and become weak. That is just one obstacle that the builders faced, but there is many more."	1	1	1
15124	6	"In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These reasons are one that is due to flamable gases, a second is due to nature itself, and the last is an already existing law.     As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium."" @CAPS1 how Flammable hydrogen is they didn't want that above a highly populated area.     Paragraph @NUM3 now states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" @CAPS2 the dirigible would not be stable enough.     Finally I said in paragraph @NUM4. ""There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""     @CAPS3 there was never a chance of a dirigible being able to dock there, as stated above."	3	3	3
15147	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solve this problem by modifying the building's framework. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 there was one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast."	3	2	3
15168	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many @CAPS2. One of these @CAPS2 being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" @CAPS1, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame. Such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" @CAPS2 plagued the construction of the docks."	4	4	4
15192	6	The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.	2	2	2
15196	6	"The main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building's Mooring Mast was safety. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" ""The owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above downtown New York."" If an accident were to happen with a dirigible it would be putting hundreds of people's lives at risk. That is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe.Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building's mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Lead weights could be used, but that was neither practical nor safe where they would be dangling high above pedestrians."	3	3	3
15217	6	The dirigibles faced some problems when they tried to dock them. The frist reason would be that flying an airship that low over a urban area is against the law. Even though it is against the law they tried it anyways and faced more problems, such as, the winds. The one time that they tried they couldn't dock it because the winds are too strong.	2	2	2
15226	6	"Builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle in docking dirigibles was the framework of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This shows the amount of work that needed to be done just on the structure of the building. Another hardship was that most dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with highly flamable hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" @CAPS1 how dangerous the hydrogen could be. Lastly, dirigibles could be weighed down by led weights. ""using these at the Empire State Building, would be dangling over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS2 if the lead weights dropped they could kill someone. Many hardships were brought about trying to dock dirigibles at the empire state building"	4	4	4
15231	6	"One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" New York City is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible. The builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area. Therefore, the dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building."	3	4	4
15233	6	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the building of the Empire State Building had many obstacles the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark was the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and greatest obstacle of all was nature surrounding the Empire State Building.The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is the dirigibles couldn't even try to attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, one dirigable approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough fearing the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even installed which meant the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigable, which could get tiring. The greatest obstacle of all was nature. Winds at the top of the building were really strong due to the violent wind currents, which could cause the dirigable to keep moving, even when tied up to the mast.Overall, the nature of weather was the huge obstacle.	3	3	3
15235	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated New York City. Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe In addition to the safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building.	3	1	2
15248	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirt dribbles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle faced with the fact that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas.	3	3	3
15255	6	"From the story the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make it accessable for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the winds at such high altitude, ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not low around, but also needed a way to support the weight of the dirigible because of the already heavy building. These are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with."	2	2	2
15256	6	"After reading the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it easy to see that this project faces numerous obstacles to overcome. The builders of the Empire State Building have a lot on their plate in order to allow dirigibles to dock their. For example, the builders have to modify and strengthen the @ORGANIZATION1 frame and also construct a mast to which dirigibles could dock.If there was to be ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,... (@NUM1) it would add an enormous amount of stress to the entire building This is why the steel frame of the Empire State Building has to be strengthened, and ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building also have to construct a mast for the dirigibles. In the end, ""...the architects who designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself"" (@NUM3). This idea of adding a mast for dirigibles to the Empire State Building creates much work for the builders.This excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 easily illustrates the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building have to overcome. From modifying the frame to constructing the mast, these builders sure do you have a greatly increased workload."	2	2	2
15261	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe.        Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there."	3	2	3
15263	6	Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldnt just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the dirigibles load and the wind would add stress. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways.	3	3	3
15267	6	The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered problems from its introduction until its conclusion. The first problem was the original design of the building. The original design did not include a dirigible docking station. When plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. To adjust, an additional @MONEY1 were spent in order to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking. The next problem became imminent after the Hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen-filled dirigible that caught fire at the Empire State Building which cause significant damage. Moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant. Wind proved to be another obstacle. The force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles. The fact that many tall spires lined the @LOCATION1 skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock. Finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that law prohibited low flying aircraft in urban areas.	4	4	4
15268	6	The problems that the Building had to face the could not unsolve the problem of mooring air ships to fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the installation of the landing gear.	0	0	0
15298	6	When the architects and builders were planning on how to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced many obstacles.  An example of an obstacle they faced was they had to construct the mast so it wouldnt fall off when a dirigible docked.  They couldnt use cable.  tether to hold the mast down because it put to much stress on the building's frame and foundation.  Another obstacle the builders had to face was how to strengthen the Empire State Building's frame.  In order to get the Empire State Building's frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face.	1	2	2
15300	6	"Throughout the designing and construction stages of the Empire State building's mooring mast, builders and engineers confronted many issues including, the distribution of building stress, fire hazards and the constant shifting caused by winds. During the planning stages of engineers, they confronted an issue, how to alliviate stress on the Empire State Building's frame. According to engineers making the ""thousand foot dirigible moored at at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame..."" @CAPS1, the building would require ""over sixty thousand dollars"" in redesigning and modifying the current building's foundation and framework. Secondly, engineers and builders never considered the fire hazards, which they were confronted with after the completion of the mooring mast. The American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, making that gaseous-filled transportation highly flammable."" An example of this safety violation occurred with the burning of a dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey, causing builders to reflect on the possible severity of this possible accident in the heavily populated area of New York. Thirdly, New York had ""violent air currents"" which could cause the rear of the dirigibles to swivel and shift. The only possible solution was to way down the back with lead blocks, but this would be ""neither practical nor safe."" Engineers and builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with many problems and concerns sometimes only addressed by irrational solutions."	4	4	4
15301	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a dirigible was moored by a single tether, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" Another obstacle was that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and when the Hindenburg was destroyed, builders realized that accident would have been much worse if it had happened ove a densely populated area like New York City. A third obstacle was violent wind currents that would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, and the back of the dirigible couldn't be weighted down like in open landing fields because that would cause the weights to dangle dangerously above that pedestrians on the street. These were major obstacles, and they are the reasons that the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used dock blimps."	4	4	4
15305	6	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Between @CAPS1, saftey, and nature, there was no way this idea could ever work. Although the idea was good it was very impracticle.     Saftey was a major problem with this idea. Most Dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium which is more flammable. If the Dirigibles ever broke out into flames over New York City it would burn the whole place down and kill thousands.      Nature was another big problem. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were shifting all the time. The ship would swivel around the moorings mast. The Dirigibles usually moored in fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down. The weights dangling above peoples heads was very dangerous.     Building the mooring mast was very dangerous and impracticle. It never happened due to saftey and now serves as a tea and soda area for use of sight seers.	3	3	3
15312	6	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it.	3	3	3
15324	6	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced it trying to allow the dirigibles to dock here are some. First having something this big land on a @NUM1 foot building would add lots of stress to the buildings frame. All of this stress have to be distributed throughout the eleven hundred foot building which was unthoughtof. In order to make the building suitable for all this weight it would cost over sixty thousand dollars and that was alot concidering every thing elsethat they were doing. Those were @CAPS1 a few obstacles they had trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building.	2	2	2
15331	6	"Basically this excerpt is talking about the ""The Mooring Mast"". It is all about the construction. One of the obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced to is the safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote reveals that the dirigibles they made is highly flammable and it's dangerous for people's lifes.  Pretend that the dirigible is on fire while it's flying up high to sky, it causes lifes.     The other obstacle the builders faced to is that it against the law. ""The other reason practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even though the building is the tallest building in New York. But it is still too low for the laws. Airship can not fly that low over the urban area, it causes accidents.         The Empire State Building is over 1,250 feet, which means on the top of the build has strong and forceful winds and the like dirigibles couldn't stop and get close to the top of the building. ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible @CAPS1 Angeles approached the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful wind."""	4	3	4
15337	6	"The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was very high. The men who built the massive structure should've realized that these expectations were urealistic. Al Smith had planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off/pick up passengers while docked at the @ORGANIZATION1. These plans would never manifest because; for in dirigibles were powered by hydrogen and it is highly flammable which could result in disaster, the winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong, and there was a law permitting aircraft's from flying so low over urban areas.In one incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the @ORGANIZATION1 saw ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]. ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mass was nature itself"" because the wind was so strong. Dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to dock. The law on the altitude of airships wouldn't allow dirigibles to even get close to the @ORGANIZATION1. The plans for the Empire State Building were never realistic and could never be fullfilled."	3	3	3
15341	6	"The main problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that ""the architects could'nt just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load & the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" Another obstacle the builders faced with the construction of the mast could be another example of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"". With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be fatal in a ""highly populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 perhaps the greatest obstacle would be ""nature itself."" The high force winds on top of the empire state building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Although the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights would be hanging over pedestrians, which ""was neither practical nor safe."""	4	3	4
15371	6	The architects had few problems. As said in @LOCATION1, stress from the Dirigibles Load was too much for The building. They would @CAPS1 over sixty thousand Dollars of modifications. Other Then That They @CAPS2 had to redesign And then make it.	1	2	2
15383	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety and actually mooring the dirigible itself. The hydrogen used within the dirigible was unsafe, as hydrogen is very flammable. If the hydrogen caught on fire, especially over a place as densely populated as New York City, many people would be harmed. Additionally, the builders were faced with the task of mooring the dirigible. Dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights. However, if one used those weights to anchor the dirigible above city streets, pedestrians below could potentially be injured. Actually allowing the dirigible to dock brought up another problem for the builders to address: if the dirigible was tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swings around and around the mast to wind. Ultimately, the builders were unable to address these issues and the Empire @CAPS3 Building is now used mainly as an observation deck and building.	3	2	3
15384	6	"Docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is a feat that will most likely never be accomplished. The main overall concern with allowing this is safety. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects realized the accident would have been even more catastrophic, had it taken place over a city like New York. Nature also played a role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work, was that a law was passed; a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area. This meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast. These architects had very little working for them and almost everything working against them."	3	3	3
15385	6	In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a hard task on their hands. They were building the tallest building in the world and when Al Smith, the head in the construction of the building, said to make it taller things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't know is that it is a little more difficult than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. The architects would have to modify the building because a thousand-foot dirigible moored on the building would add stress to the building. Dirigibles used hydrogen which is extremely flamable, if it were to catch on fire in downtown New York it would be desasterous. Nature poses a threat as well, the winds on  top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivle around. The final obstacle is there is a law that prohibits airships to fly to low in urban areas. In the end the plan failed.	3	3	3
15398	6	"There would have been many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face if the decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from out side the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On @DATE1, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey. the owners realized how much worse it would have been is a place such as New York City.Another big obstacle would have been nature itself. ""The winds on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast the back of the ship would move around, making it hard for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead wieght then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging over the pedestrians of New York City.The final obstacle that biulders of the empire state @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of the @ORGANIZATION1. They would not even be allowed to approach the @ORGANIZATION1."	4	4	4
15425	6	The Empire State building was not a good place to attach a blimp to. One reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues. In every country except the @PERSON1, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans. Even after @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished.	2	3	3
15428	6	"When building a great task, many obstacles need to be faced. For the builders of the Empire State Building it was ones concerning the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. One was safety. The builders had to make sure it was safe to dock on and off the blimp, and it was safe to fly. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" People wouldn't be safe on a blimp that could expload at any moment. Another obsticle the builders had to face was building the mooring mast itself for docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The blimp wouldn't be able to hold correctaly to the mast and it would move around too much. It wasn't safe or practical for anyone. These are some obsticales many builders have to face, but the ones of the Empire State Building overcame them well."	3	3	3
15429	6	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in there design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building.	3	2	3
15435	6	"During the construction of the mooring mast a top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced some obstacles. One obstacle that they faced was that they couldn't just ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, they had to do some work on the building, so it could support it. As the @CAPS2 said, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation"". Another obstacle the builders faced was that if there was an accident, like the Hindenburg, it would be much more dangerous, because there would be many more people nearby, who could get hurt by the fire. ""The greatest obstacle of the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" said the @CAPS2. The wind currents above the building shifted due to ""violent air currents."" Also, dirigibles need to have weights attached at the back of them, but at the Empire State Building, these weights would be dangling high above pedestrians... neither practicle nor safe"". The other obstacle was that blimps couldn't get close enough to the mast, due to the wind, like the Los angeles. Due to all of these obstacles, the mooring mast hasn't been used since."	3	4	4
15457	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome."	4	4	3

For example, ""The greasest issues was one of safety."" Safety was a major obstacle because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle faced in this attempt was ""nature itself.""

15489	6	"@ORGANIZATION2's article The Mooring Mast"", explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with Hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dagerous. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making an approach dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire state illegal. Many practical reasons crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State."""	3	3	3
15504	6	"THE OBSTACLES IS ""TO THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE MORNING MAST WAS NATURE ITSELF. THE WINDS ON TOP OF THE BUILDING WERE CONSTANTLY SHIFTING DUE TO VIOLENT AIR CURRENTS."""	1	1	1
15512	6	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith Announced that the Empire State building would be reaching the height of 1,250 feet; taller then the previous largest building, the Chrysler Building. Smith made the building taller by adding a top or a hat. John @CAPS1 described this as ""[The top of the empire State Building] would be more than an ornament... The empire state building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers"" (pg 1). This dream consisted of having a mooring mass at the top of the building to dock dirigible, or blimbs. However, many obsticles emerged the more they began to plan this, such as the amount of stress it would add to the buildings frame, the use of hydrogen opposed to helium, and simply nature itself. ""A thousand-foot drigible held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame... The Empire State building would have to... [have] over @MONEY1 worth of modifications (pg @NUM1). ""Most diribles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg @NUM1)"". ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... they would be dangling high above pedestrians... that was neither safe nor practical"""	3	2	3
15518	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedstrians wasn't safe. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there.	3	3	3
15524	6	"The builders faced many problems in their attempts to allow a dirigible to land at the Empire State Building. One of the main reasons was safety, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I would have been to large of a risk to allow such a dirigible over New York. Another problem was the air currents, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would forever prohibit any airship to dock with the mast, or even approach the city to attempt to dock."	3	3	3
15548	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast.	3	3	3
15555	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (@NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" ('s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. the winds up there were very strong, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful."	2	2	2
15572	6	The builders of the empire state building face a lot of problems on trying to make a dock for dirigibles.  The builders could not just simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.  They had to think about how the dirigible @LOCATION2 fair, they had to strengten the foundation of the building and a landing area for the dirigible.  Dirigibles were able to dock him by means of an electric winch The problem with this is they were in Downtown New York and New York city was a densely populated area.  A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe.  Also a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable.  So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead.  Another obstacle was the law, Airships cannot fly too low over urban areas.  The greatest obsticle of them all though was nature itself The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  This idea sounded great at first, but too many things could go wrong.	4	4	4
15584	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was installing the mooring mast, the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because the weight of the blimp moored at the top held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would transmit all the way to the building's foundation. The builders would have to modify and strengthen to build to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they faced was the cost, because it would take over sixty thousand dollar's to make the proper modifications to the building's framework. Also safety was another major obstacle, they would have to make people were going to be safe, because Most dirigible from other countrie's used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The area's were densely populated an accident over the city would be much worse. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, but winds on the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back would swivel around. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down by weights, but using these would be dangerous dangling that high above pedestrians. Many obstacles were practical reasons why they couldn't moor at the Empire State Building. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas and make it illegal for ships to tie up to the building. So long these obstacles were faced in attempting to allow docking.	3	4	4
15595	6	"There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirgibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1, much revision to the structure's frame was needed. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirgible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp. There was also a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles."	3	3	3
15609	6	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.	3	3	3
15614	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress *** to the building.The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area.The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building.	2	1	2
15633	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature and safety. Safety played a large role in the building of the Empire State Building. Two main safety conserns were getting passengers safely on and off dirigibles and the substances they were filled with. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" (paragraph @NUM1). The next obstacle the builders faced was nature. The wind speeds would shift due to violent air currents, causing the dirigibles to swivel around. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (paragraph @NUM2). Due to nature and safety issues, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles allowing dirigibles to dock there."	3	2	3
15656	6	The builders of the empire state building faced alot of trouble and confusion in the attempt to let allow dirigibles to dock there. This had never been done before @CAPS1 they didnt know what to expect, except for a mooring mast. At first Al smith and his builders thought this was an amazing idea, technology of the future, but things werent that easy. They faced complications with the @ORGANIZATION1 with there research on dirigibles. It was a complicated process because it was @CAPS1 high up in the air, and there was alot of practicing involved. Next was the alterations made to the building, the building wasnt strong enough to hold the dirigible @CAPS1 they make @MONEY1 worth of changes. They finally realized this was an unsafe idea, and it wouldnt be good with the highly flamable hielium, @CAPS1 they were back to square 1. Then the government gave them a law that said no airships flying to low at or over urban areas, wich would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building. And the top floors were turned into soda fountain.	3	3	3
15657	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many promblems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of there problem they encountered when designing the mast. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet. The building was not strong enough, so they had to strengthen the building with a new steel frame. Then the builders also faced safety issues. At a thousand feet the air currents were extremely violant. By the end of the construction it was quickly noticed that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building.	3	2	3
15672	6	The buiders faced many obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat surface it took alot of stress and hard work. The dirigible was held by a single cable tether and the dirigible was about a thousand feet. That made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigibles load.	1	2	2
15697	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" ( @NUM1). Although at first the builders looked past this, there were many other non-legal obstacles that they faced. There was also a safety issue with docking dirigibles, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" ( @NUM2). One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" ( @NUM3). With all of these obstacles it would not only be improbable, but close to impossible to dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building."	3	4	4
15704	6	In the excerpt  The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that it was strictly hard for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Many dilemmas and complications the builders faced. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work.	2	2	2
15706	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). They had to modify the steel frame of the building. They had to do this all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). This would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So the flammable dirigibles were too dangerous to fly over such a populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM4). In the end the problems the builders faced were too many, and unfixable, so the docking of dirigibles in the Empire State Building was no more."	3	4	4
15711	6	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, if a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether was moored at the top of the building, it would add stress to the frame. The workers had to transmit the stress ""All the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" They had to modify & strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems the frame work, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could do to prevent this, flammability, or existing laws."	2	2	2
15713	6	"Marcia Amidon Lsted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. One obstacle they would have to faced was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" ( @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lsted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there."	3	3	3
15726	6	Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unplausable. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out.	3	3	3
15733	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" The excerpt went through @CAPS1 obstacles Such as @CAPS2. If the men were not trying to compete the buildings would probably have been okay. If you take your time and real try to reach your goal you can."	0	0	0
15743	6	If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued. If they were to use the Empire State Building, They would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process. Even then if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. All in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea	3	3	3
15744	6	Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obsticles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. The building wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire state bilding, it would have pulled the building untill it feel over. The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard. Also dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe. for the people on the ground. In the and it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building.	2	3	3
15746	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles included safety issues, nature and the law. Safety issues was a problem because in the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This explains why they couldn't do it because of one of the dirigibles would explode in downtown New York it would cause severe damage and losses of life because it's a populated area. Another obstacle was nature. Nature played it's role because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents."" This would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around which was either practical or safe. The last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas. This would have made it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These obstacles had made the builders face problems to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
15752	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had obstacles in their way. There were Dirigibles that were one thousand feet long and they had an obstacle which was that they did not have much space in New York to land. Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked/talked with experts and got equipment ""and mooring operations oat the U.S. Naval Air Station"". which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything. The Navy offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast. Also the architect met with president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the Pacific ocean. so the builders had many obstacles and attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	2	3
15757	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, they were mainly ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable"". A fire in one of these would be devastating being over an enormous city like New York. The wind currents would also make it impossible to dock there. ""The ship would swivel around the mooring mask"", and could even potentially puncture the frame. The whole idea was dangerous and risky. In fact, it would of been illegal for flying ""too low over urban areas"". Not only was it dangerous, but aganst the law too. Overall, these were the obstacles that workers faced, and the obstacles that won out in the long run."	3	2	3
15760	6	Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems such as to much wind movement, to much weight, and to many safty risks. when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there.The wind movement would move the dirigibles around when trying to dock so they would have troubles with that. They would also have weight problems because they didn't have a stable enough frame around the building. They would have to pay alot of money to fix this problem.The last problem was a safety problem. After the German dirigible Hindenburg blew up they realized that it was way to dangerous to have blimps landing over crowded cities It was also a flying law of airships not being able to go that low over a city.This is why the builders had faced so many problems.	3	3	3
15761	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building faced the obstacles of the use of hydrogen in dirigibles in which is highly flammable, nature itself, and an existing law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.It stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, most dirigibles outside the united state used hydrogen, which is very flammable. Realizing that this kind of happening above an outrageously populated area such as New York City would be extremely dangerous. To explicate. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"".However, the greatest obstale was nature itself. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting. which was certainly not safe. For example, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The builders soon realized that this issue could unfortunately, not be resolved.Lastly, a more apparent obsticle that the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to even approach the area.The obstacles of the use of hydrogen, nature itself, and an existing law, made it impossible for Al Smith's plan to become realistic."	3	3	3
15764	6	"During the construction of the empire state building builders faced many obstacles with attempting to allow a dirigible to dock there. These problems consisted of safety and practical isshues. one safety isshue was that most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen was more flammable than helium. This led to the hindenburg a german airship to be destroyed by fire. ""most dirigibels from outside the United States uses hydrogen rather that helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders also had practical isshues such as it was illegal to fly a airship to low low over a city. ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building."" These obstacles stopped the hops landing on a building."	2	3	3
15767	6	"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	4	4
15783	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flamable because they use hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire and once the Empire State Building noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit. Another obstacle was one that couldnt be fixed, because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definatly not safe. The last thing that stopped them was a law that was against any airships the flew too low in urban areas. All in all, the builders faced too many obstacles to build a mast for dirigibles"	4	4	4
15798	6	Trying to allow dirigibles dock on the Empire State building caused way to many obsticals for the builders. Dirigibles were up too one thousand feet long, this would make it realistically impossible for it to dock because the size of it would add stress to the buildings frame builders would have to reconstruct and make the frame stronger. Most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and not hellium which I highly flamable if cought fire pedestrians could be seriously hurt. Finding out later they an existing law about airships flying to low which would make it illegal for a dirigible to even fly near the Empire State building	3	2	3
15821	6	"@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt The Mooring Mast"" of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle.The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak through proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock.The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it."""	3	3	3
15847	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. For one just letting a thousand foot drigibles land on the top of a building was a huge obstacle.. By having the dirigible on the building held on by one cable tether was bad. So the builder had to work on the steel frame of the building so that the dirigible wouldn't add so much stress to the building. That was a huge obstacles the builders of the Empire State building had to face."	2	1	2
15854	6	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the creation of The Mooring Mast, and its purpose to extending the height of the Empire State Building. Although during the 1930's the concern of the Mooring Mast serving as a docking area for drigibles, also known as today as blimps. After the 85th floor frame was built and the skeleton of the mast of steel and stainless steel glass windows, issues concerning the landing drigibles arose within the public.There were @NUM1 major reasons why the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never really completed. One reason was because of safety. The excerpt explains how dirigibles from outside of U.S used hydrogen instead of helium. And, using hydrogen is extremely flammable. They used the example of the German diriglie Hindenburg being destroyed b/c it was on fire in @LOCATION1.Second reason was the problem of wind currents. Winds were extremely violent. Dirigibles would move and sway alot b/c of the strong winds. And the moving dirigibles being that they were at least @DATE2 ft long dangled high above urban areas which wasn't safe at all for people walking under it.Thirdly was the issue of it being against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas was also a safety hazard for people. It would be illegal for dirigibles to be tied up on mooring mast above cities filled w/people risking that it might fall onto people."	3	4	4

First, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, was determined to create the tallest building in the world; even taller than the Chrysler building being @NUM1 feet tall. He also wanted the building to be aesthetically pleasing, and nothing ordinary. His determination led him to the idea of the mooring mast, which in itself came with additional obstacles. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This meant that the frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Other obstacles included the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable, and could have caused a giant chaotic mess if over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" meaning that even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel everywhere, which was ""neither practical nor safe."""	3	4	4
15856	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle the builders encountered was the dirigible ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame"" (@NUM1). The frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flamable. Anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds. The mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked."	3	3	3
15862	6	The builders of the empire state building could not build the moor mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of Empire state building was to flat. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building. They design the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers. However it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They think greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air current, so it can pratact from worst accident but it is still not safe.	2	2	2
15876	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION1 the builders faced obstacles to allow dirigible to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle that the builders faced is the lack of suitable landing area on the roof. For that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible. Later they had to put a steel needle on top of the empire State building so the balloons could dock up and let people out. Next obstacle that they faced was that ""outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building. Another reasing of an obstacle is that it was against the law for airships flying too low over urban areas for it can tie up and forceful winds will blow it in different directions. For that reasoning the winds could force the balloon to go in different directions and hit other building if the winds are strong. Those are obstacles the builders faced in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."	3	3	3
15878	6	Based on the exerpt, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all for nothing. They spent extra money to restruture things but there was no need. Even if they found some way to get the dirigibles to dock, it was already illegal for aircraft to fly that close to cities.	1	1	1
15892	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast,, by @PERSON1, the author describes many obstacles builders faceded, to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problemb was the modifications that had to made to the buildings framework. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,"" showing how expensive this product was going to be. A second potential problemb was that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many different complications. One of which would be how ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" a consiquence feared by the piolet of Los Angeles. Another problemb brought up by the winds shifting, would be the ship spinnig, potentialy resulting in catastrophe. They acomidated for the use with unpractical things, eventualy leading to the downfall of the mooring mast."	3	3	3
15928	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there ware extrem to over come.one obstacles for the builders was trying to make it so the building its self could handle the stress of the dirigibles tied to the to the building with wind pulling at it and swaying back and forth as wind direction changes.Also it is to low for a dirigibles to be flying because of the other buildings. The most important is the gases inside the dirigible is flamible and would be devistation to the people below in New York City.	3	2	3
15945	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was that they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes to the buildings framework because docking a dirigibles on the building would put a lot of stress on the framework and foundation of the building. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen which was highly flammable and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it such a densely populated area. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line @NUM1) This would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably. This would endager pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles made docking a dirigible here impossible."	4	3	4
15951	6	They were many obstacles the @ORGANIZATION2 of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was the stress of the dirigibles's load and the wind pressure didn't allow to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, in which was nearly @NUM1 feet below. Another things that was an obstancle for the @ORGANIZATION2 was it was alot of money it was over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. The last obstacle was it safety. Most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States uses hydrogen rather then helim, which hydrogen is highly flamable. This let to a accident on May 6, 1937, the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it happened in dowtown New York. This are some obtecles the @ORGANIZATION2 of @ORGANIZATION2 faced.	3	3	3
15984	6	"In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon Lsted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author told the readers that after building the Empire State Building the builders had to reconstruct the entire building having to make is stronger to support the top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers of the building also had to be working at a height of 1,250 feet. They not only had to rebuild the foundation and strength of the building, but also the top. ""Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again - this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast."" These are just some of the many hardships the workers had to face."	2	2	2
15988	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. Which this would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. But with this came lots of work. And they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. In the story it says ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows."""	1	1	1
15994	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to figure a way around. The architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building. Soon enough, problems evolved that could not be fixed. An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these problems, the architects never added the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew that it would not be used as it was intended to.	3	3	3
16011	6	"Throughout the excerpt, obstacles the builders faced were difficult. Many fell under being able to let dirigibles dock there. Some difficulties the faced were that outside from the states, more dirigibles were being made, but with ""hydrogen rather than helium"". they stated, ""hydrogen is highly flamable"". There was fear for the people, since New York was so densely populated. There were also whether problems. Winds were constantly shifting. ""Ship would swival around and around"". Realizing the danger, all they could do was shut it down."	2	2	2
16014	6	"In the excerpt the builders had faced many obstacles in ader for dirigibles to dock there. They had faced many challenges. One of the main concerns were safety. Al Smith had commented saying ""They were trying to figure some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" among any other safety issues. "	1	1	1
16019	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include: hydrogen gas being highly flammable, high winds and wind shifts at the top of the building, laws that airships could not fly too low over cities such as New York City.The problem of hydrogen gas came to them when a blimp blew up in New Jersey, then the owners realized how bad it could've been in the city. When it comes to high winds the excerpt says, ""... if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" Also, the law mentioned would have made it illegal for blimps to come close to the Empire State Building"	2	3	3
16024	6	"Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerouse. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things to dock at the building. For example ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and be fact that construction on such a high building at the time was unpractable, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So to close, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ened the Empire State Building docks."	3	3	3
16029	6	The builders of the Empire State Building and encountered numerous obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles including a weakened framework, nature and weather, potential fire hazards, and U.S. laws. Because the building was not originally designed to hold down dirigibles, the frame was not sturdy enough to survive the pulling and moving of the blimp in the air. The dirigibles would also be vacillating in the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which was 102 storeys. Aside from pulling loose or damaging the building itself, the dirigibles were in danger of being punctured by another building's spire. Damage to the dirigible in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area in New York City around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and blowup, such as the case with the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians or other structures could be seriously damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also probable because of the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws forbid airships to come that close to urban areas like @ORGANIZATION2. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it. In conclusion, many issues surfaced for the builders as they attempted to transform the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles.	4	4	4
16036	6	The obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. To do that they would need a lot of money like sixty thousand dollars.Another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. But the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.	3	2	3
16045	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that most diribles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey (paragraph @NUM1). It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the @LOCATION2. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless of lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped."	4	4	4
16054	6	"On the excerpt there were a lot of obstacles on the atempt of Building the Empire State Building and making it safe to dock dirigibles. The first obstacle to building the Empire State building was that the engeier Al Smith wanted to make the Empire State building, ""the world's tallest building."" ""When the Empire State building was conceived, it was planed as the world's tallest building, taller even then the new Chrysler building that was being constructed."" (@CAPS1 1) the proble was that the architector of the Chrysler Building put a 185 ft spire inside the building. Al Smith got an idea that would make the Empire State Building taler and beater. His idea would be more than a ""ornament"" ""their top, the said, would selrve a higher calling. The Empire State building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers."" He believed that he could use the building as a dock for dirigible, so people could get on and off. The proble was that that the frame would not work. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) They attempted to land dirigibles @NUM2 times but they weren't able to do it at the end. ""In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3) They could not fix the problem."	0	1	1
16058	6	"It is within our obligations as human beings to have dreams and want to convert them into reality. Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the empire state building is one I'd consider to be rather erratic. There were many obstacles that proved from early on, the fate of this project was failure.       It is apparent from very early into the constructions that this was surreal because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (paragraph 6). Having dirigibles cruising through a large city should have been perceivably impossible to Al Smith, even before the construction of the building occurred.     Safety was also something to be seriously taken into consideration since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" which also intertwined with the laws of objects flying too low over an urban area (paragraph @NUM1)."	2	2	2
16074	6	Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen a highly flamable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This raises safety issues for the urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction.	3	2	3
16085	6	"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" @CAPS1, the builders were over to overcome this problem. After the building however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for it's full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a density populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the prexisting law against low-flying aircraft. This put an end to Al Smith's dreams."	4	4	4
16117	6	"Construction always has challenges. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon Lsted, there are many challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to land dirigibles there. Some of the obstacles the builders faced included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the frame would need to be modified, the cost, and nature itself.landing the dirigibles would be a hard task. For one, the dirigibles are enormous, they are ""a thousand-foot"" long flying devices. This would make it extremely difficult to land just because of its weight. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way  to the building's foundation."" This is a struggle because the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified."" This modification would take lots of effort and planning. Plus, modification also brings up the problem of cost. There would have to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" That cost is mindblowing and would create challenges of how to get that money. In addition nature itself was an obstacle. Winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Nature would bring up many challenges for the builders to have to work around. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3	4
16119	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was an issue for the builders. The dirigibles made outside of the United States were used with hydrogen. This became a safety issue because ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". On top of the building, the wind is always shifting because of ""violent air currents"". The shifting winds would be a problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low of urban areas""; making it illegal to dock the dirigibles. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing danger to the city. There are many obstacles the builders faced that made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."	4	3	4
16120	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians."	3	3	3
16130	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast the builders of the empire state building had to go through many obstacles to get there job done. I paragraph @NUM1 it states that al smith announces that the empire state building will reach a height of @NUM2 feet, this would be a big obstacle for the builders because they have to risk their lives being that high up just to construct this building. Another obstacle for the workers would be working next to the dirigibles because in the exerpt it state that the dirigible a extreamely flammable so if it touches fire the workers could get seriously hurt.	1	1	1
16132	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted describes the problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced like the amount of stress that the dirigibles would add to the frame of the building. safety issues and laws, and the winds around the mast. Any dirigible would add on tremendous stress to the already constructed frame of the building and builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought about before construction started. The builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as ""a higher calling."""	3	4	4
16133	6	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed."	3	3	3
16143	6	Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigibles dangleing nearly @NUM1 feet above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the buildings frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about @NUM1 feet down. In order for this to work the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown of course and into another building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place they should have checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. Builders of this landing dock and the empire state building just faced too many obstacles.	4	3	4
16147	6	The builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles.  One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible	1	2	2
16161	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	4	4	4
16177	6	There are many obstacles the builders had to face while attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles. One obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars' to the worth of modifications for the building's framework. In paragraph @NUM1, it stated that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had to have a skeleton of steel, stated in paragraph @NUM2,	2	2	2
16181	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above the densely populated areas such as downtown New York.    The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights.       The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.	4	3	4
16192	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it talks about the Hindenburg bursting into flames over New Jersey + how much dangerous it would of been over a highly- populated areas such as New York.	2	1	2
16201	6	"In order to dock these dirigibles, the builders would face many serious problem. These problems in which builders would be forced to deal with is when, a city, and framework. First off, the building frame was too weak to tied to a dirigible. This is because it ""would add stress"" to the frame which could ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Due to this they would be forced to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars"" to strengthen the frame. A second issue the were faced with is that it is in a city. Laws had prohibited ""flying too low over urban areas"", let alone ""tie up to the building"". Due to this fact, they would be forced to design a way for it to dock. Finally, ""violent air currents"" would cause more issues. The builders would have to deal with building a piece mooring equipment that could with stan the wrath of ""nature itself"". All in all, this plan would force many issues on the builders, in order to function"	3	4	4
16224	6	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building were building a mast, dirigibles docking on top of the building, and a law for dirigibles. The architects and builders spend a lot of time building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles were trying to figure out how to dock to the building yet most dirigibles failed. A law the dirigibles were unable to dock on urban areas in case of a problem within the dirigibles. These were the obstacles the builders faced in an attempt to create a mast and allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building.	2	2	2

This is a big obstacle because if the blimp is high off the ground of @CAPS1 and then catches on fire, that could end badly another obstacle was nature; due to violent air currents' which made buildings sway. This is also bad because if the blimp moves or the building sways into the building than one or the other could break. The last obstacle was the law, which was against 'airships flying too low over urban areas'. So if they did build the mast, it would be even illegal to get a dirigible close.

16243	6	The Empire State building is known as the worlds tallest building. The building is located in New York. Al Smith the head of building the Empire State building, added a top or a hat to the building, that made the building be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. The Empire State building was equipped for transportation. The transportation was dirigible, or zeppelin. The Empire State building had a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. An obstacle that the Building faced was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Al seen an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire state building. Al seen it as something creative and new. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fulfilled. No thought of safety was thought about before constructing the idea either. The greatest reason was most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium which is a higher @CAPS1 for flames. Also nature itself was a big problem the idea had safety problems and couldnt @CAPS1 flames in Downtown New York	2	3	3
16266	6	"When the architects behind the mooring Mast of the Empire State Building first began there work in designing it, they did not take into account the @CAPS1 that they would have to overcome to dock a dirigible. In the excerpt it States that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building: however the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means that the builders would need to design Some way of doing this when the building was already begun. Other @CAPS1 included those of safety. The exerpt tells that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen"" which is more flammable than helium. This combined with the fact that there really was no way of securing the tale of a dirigible moored at the mast could cause an accident @CAPS2 to that of the Hindenburg over a ""densely populated area Such as downtown New York"""	2	3	3
16269	6	"Builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A mooring mast, for docking drigibles, would add stress to the buildings frame and ""could not simply be dropped atop the Empire State Building.

Owners of the building realized if an accident like the Hindenburg were to take place above a densely populated city or area such as downtown New York, results would have been far worst. Builders greatest obstacle would be nature itself. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the air ship could tether to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast.

Next, New York City would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Then the greatest reason of safety came upon them. That was, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. And hydrogen is highly flammable. On @DATE1 a German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire state building realized if that happened to New York and how big of a problem that would cause. The final and greatest obstacle they faced to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. From all the violent wind and air currents would be hard to tether the dirigibles to the mast.

16279	6	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the obstacles that had to be faced was dealing with the hydrogen from dirigibles outside of the united states. The hydrogen was very flamable and the would not be able to stand a fire in such a high populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The winds from nature would make it hard to control the dirigible so people were afraid of the dirigible crashing into the building. Those were some of the obstacles that were faced.	3	2	3
16286	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that they needed a mooring mast so that the dirigibles could anchor, but they couldn't drop a mooring mast on the flat surface of the Empire State Building's roof. It would put too much stress to the building. This problem cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle was safety precautions. The dirigibles were mostly filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible was to catch on fire, then the whole Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone in it. It also wasn't safe because strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, causing danger to pedestrians below. One other obstacle that the builders faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If they tried to anchor a dirigible on the Empire State Building, it would be illegal. Due to all of these obstacles not getting results, the whole idea has disappeared.	4	3	4

16355	6	The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the High Winds. The winds blew the dirigibles two-and-frow. It would be cotastrophic if an accident occurred. Secondly, The Law stood in the way of this idea. A law in New York was passed, that prevented dirigibles from flying over urban areas. The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey. Lastly, and probably the simpilest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt landing. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in most ways.	2	3	3

The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to air currents. It was difficult for the dirigibles to dock. The ""four-blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."""	3	3	3

16389	6	Builders faced many problems with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control like hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building and therefore they wouldn't be able to dock.	2	2	2
16412	6	The builders faced a lot of issues to allow drigibles to land place on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious or carefull on building the platform to allow drigibles to dock. The drigibles (Blimp) were very big transportation machines that were made out of Steel and Cotton Fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable. Because of all these problems the procautions the builders had to make, makeing the mast was a failuer and left for the future transportations to plains.	2	2	2
16414	6	"The architects of the Empire State Building faced many safety & practical obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of it. For example, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a @NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical & safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building."	4	4	4
16420	6	"There were many problems the builders of the Empire state building faced when it came to dirigibles.They faced problems with ""... Violent air currents"" That flow above the building. These would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock, and sway the back end while they were docked. Another problem was that there was an ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State building. These obstacles described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Lsted show why the spire at the top of the Empire State building was never used to dock dirigibles."	3	2	3
16424	6	"The Empire State Building was designed to become the world tallest buiding, with a few tricks up its sleave. The building was originally planned to also function as a Mooring mast for dirigibles. Unfortunately many problems lay in the way interning this theory into reality. One obstacle the constructors of the Empire State Building faced was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. ""Most Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. ""The use of hydrogen posed a dangerous threat to the safty of civilians in New York City. Another problem which was encountered with the building was the wind."" the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast...

Also the dirigibles body could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and get off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open oservation platform.

16452	6	In order to build the Empire State building, some Of the workers endured problems while constructing it. The engeineeres and architects consulted first with the experts. The obstacles the builders had to face were, one the height. It was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the buildings frame. Wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting to the violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up the back part of the ship would sway from the wind. In the end the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the problems that came with it.	2	1	2
16454	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders."	4	4	4
16460	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the architects faced was the building's frame. They needed to design the landing area so that if a dirigible landed there, it wouldn't add too much stress to the building's frame. Another problem was the stress of the load, and wind pressure. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred  feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem. Finally, after the builders figured out that they needed to make various adjustments, also to strengthen the building's steel frame, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made,"" which is a lot of money! Those are the obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2	3
16461	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (Lsted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."	3	3	3
16478	6	"While they were attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area.

The owners of the Empire State Building felt that it wouldn't be safe if the dirigible set on fire with a densely populated area right below it.The greatest obstacle that was faced was the use of the mooring mast with nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The owners of the Empire State building believed that if something went wrong then the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. This was very unsafe."	2	3	3
16480	6	"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was hieght. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. Also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author States, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; ""they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in Building the tallest building, The Empire State building."	1	3	1
16489	6	"Throughout the short story The Mooring Mast, the builders faced many obstacles to complete their vision. For example the workers had to design a mast that would take ""the stress of the dirigible's load"" (@NUM1). The cable at the top was stated to not be able to maintain the stress the dirigible would produce, so the engineers had to develope a new solution to distribute the weight of the dirigible evenly. This cost them time and money due to the massive hight of the empire state building. the architects also had to do extra research to develope the mast. The workers took tours of the U.S. Naval Air Station and met with the president of the airship transport company just so they could be sure the dirigibles would land in a safe secure way. These obsticles had to be faced in order to produce their unrealistic dream."	3	3	3
16503	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped For an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goas for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left uncomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."	4	4	4

The architects had trouble with putting the moor mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The mooring mast would have stressed the building. Because of the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to strengthen and modify the whole building which cost over sixty thousand dollars. So they build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Those were the obstacles in making a moor mast."	2	2	2

Unfortunately, builders faced many obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan flourish. Many engineers did not think of the hazards and for ""reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The greatest issue was safety. Dirigibles used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to occur again, it would be an immense danger to the densely populated city.Another obstacle were the winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly shifting and the backs of dirigibles would swing around and around.There was also a law against low flying aircraft over urban areas. so it was illegal for a ship to ever even approach the area. The idea for a docking station was great, however, many obstacles were not brought up in the early @CAPS2 of planning, so the Empire State Building never came to be a dock."	4	3	4

The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accomadate the @NUM1 ft dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications. Another problem was safety. A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. Those are obstacles the builders faced when building the Empire State Building."	4	4	4
16539	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle was the expanded use. New York was the lack of suitable landing area they would have. With this Al Smith saw opportunity for his building. He would add a morning mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea there would have to be lots of planing.	1	1	1
16545	6	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. Firsty, is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obsticles that couldn't be safely tackled."	3	3	3
16550	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builder's would want to dock the dirigibles they couldnt because there was no right area to land them. ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature it's self can take control. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles if landed on the Empire State Building would be weighed down because in the back would lead weights so, it would weight it down. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building."	2	2	2
16593	6	The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't put little waits on the back because if they ever fell they would @CAPS2 podestriens. And there was a law past ships couldnt dock on Building or even come close to rural areas. That is some of the obsticals the workers faced.	1	2	2
16599	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" That was struggle number one, a thousand-foot drigible would add too much stress to the frame. ""The stress of the drigibles load and as the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" That was another obstacle the builder's had to overcome considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below. The Empire State building then had to be strengthened and modified in order to build a stronger foundation for the mooring of a drigible upon the Empire State Building. Those were some of the many obstacles the builder's went through in designing the mast."	3	3	3
16607	6	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used."	3	3	3
16621	6	The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely hard for a captain to control their ship. When anchored to the mast by a single tether, the dirigible would be twisted around the spire by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers. Another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in New York City. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never accomplished their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast. 	2	3	3
17840	7	There was a girl name @PERSON1. She loved spending time with her mom. Every weekend they would either @CAPS3 the movies, amusement or water park, or just stay home. This time was different though. @PERSON1 was even a little scared about @CAPS1 was about @CAPS3 happen. Today was a @DATE1 and @PERSON1 and her mom was watching videos of her mom when she was young. After the video, @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and laughed. Once they settled down, @PERSON1s mom looked sad. @CAPS1s wrong mom? @PERSON1 asked. I have @CAPS3 go. I have @CAPS3 go somewhere for work and cant take you with me, mom replied. @CAPS2 not? asked @PERSON1. I dont know, but I need you @CAPS3 wait here with your father. Ill be back soon, the mom said calmly. With that @PERSON1s mom left and drove away. @PERSON1 stood there confused and wishing her mom didnt have @CAPS3 go. Then she went @CAPS3 the phone and called her dad. An hour later, @PERSON1s dad came @CAPS3 her house. He calmed @PERSON1 down, who had been crying because she missed her mom. @PERSON1 went @CAPS3 her room and began  @CAPS3 wait patiently for her mom. Weeks past and @PERSON1s mom still hasnt returned. Every night now @PERSON1 cried hoping her mom would come. During the day she would wait watching for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now. Though see never complained @CAPS3 her father and understands that her mom left for an important reason, but still she missed her mom. Two years have passed since @PERSON1s mom had left. @PERSON1 didnt cry as much but still waited. Waited for her mother @CAPS3 come back. One day @PERSON1 heard a knock on the door, she answered it and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, then hugged each other. They both cried and her mom whispered Im sorry. @CAPS3 @PERSON1. Now @PERSON1 and her were unseperatable. They never left each others side again.	11	12	23
17856	7	The time that I was patient was not long ago. It was a day of boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy some candy, I wanted a lorry pop. The man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy. It was @NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like that. It was at the cernical, I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the life gaurd instructer for not letting him on the ride. He was arguing for an half an hour. S was patient waiting for him to stop. I did not complane or argue about the man who was wasting our time.	6	8	14
17876	7	One @DATE1 week a couple of years ago my grandparents were over. We went to my @ORGANIZATION1s sisters house and my @ORGANIZATION1 and aunt (my @ORGANIZATION1s sister) were going to teach me hoe to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and the teacher wouldnt do it for you. They said if I learned to tie my shoes I would get to pick something out at the dollar store so that got me all excited! When we got their after I had lunch they began teaching me. The tirck they taught me went like this: after you have the first crossover step you make the bop(tree) and you put the other string around it (the bunny loving around the tree. @CAPS1 you put it through (the bunny darling in its hole.) @CAPS1 youre bond. After many tries was starting to get the hang of it. Later we went back to my house and my @ORGANIZATION1 kept helping me. Finally one afternoon I got it, my @ORGANIZATION1 was happy and she kept telling me good job. Later we went to the store and picked something out! My @ORGANIZATION1 had to be patient with me. She wasnt getting all mad when I kept messing up she just kept being encouraging and patient. My @ORGANIZATION1 was patient and it helped me learn faster.	8	11	19
17887	7	It was my first camping trip! Well, we went camping when I was one but I dont remenber a lot. I was super excited! So, Im sorry if I couldnt help but wonder @CAPS1 the ? are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasnt really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said daddy when are we gonna be there? I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, I didnt I took what I had learnt earier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every one in a while everyone is a little impatient.	10	10	20
17903	7	The time I was patient was when I was wait on my mom to have her @CAPS2. The reason why is becaus she was being a pain to me. She was mean and every thing. So I was lik oh my @CAPS1 she need to have this @CAPS2 so all this can be over and done with. This was when she was oly @NUM1 months so I know that I had to be so patient with her antill the @NUM2 months was over.	5	7	12
17910	7	One night when I got home from cheer I was starving, and the dinner wasnt even on the grill. We were having steak, brown rice, and mack and chees. To past time I went upstairs to take a shower I took ten minutes to take a shower and it still wasnt ready. So I did some homework. I did math, reading, and I study for a test. The mack and chees was ready the steak was almost ready and the brown rice wasnt even close to being ready. I was so hungry and tried, but I keeped my patient. Oh my gosh the food smelt so yummy. I wanted to eat right then. I was so hungry that I had to put gum into my mouth to keep my mouth busy. Two minutes later the steak was ready mack and chees was ready but we are still waiting for the brown rice. My sister and I set the table and pourd our drinks I still had my patient. Five minutes later the food was ready. All four of us sat down at the dinner table and ate. Oh my gosh it was so yummy. I had two little pieces of steak, three scoups of rice, I love rice, and a tiny piece of mack and chees. The dinner was awesome. After that dinner I went strait up to bed.	8	11	19
17933	7	@CAPS1 story of patient One time I was patient was when I went to the @CAPS2 for a check-up. Me and @CAPS1 dad have wait in the lobby for ?? time, after every ?? went in for the appointments. I couldnt take it no more, but he made me stay. So I kept quiet. Well, most of the time really I wanted to say something really bad but instead I held it in. So finally we went in I was so happy. It was like I was the happiest man on earth. Thats @CAPS1 story about patience.	7	8	15
17945	7	A @DATE2 ago my @CAPS1 was brought into the @ORGANIZATION1 because of her incision from a previous operation panste open. Because of @DATE2 physical coller coaster, I have missed three days @DATE1 and one day @DATE2 of school so far because I was gone visiting her. Now I'm back and trying to catch up with all my classes. So far I've achieved that goal with @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me and willing to hold off grading me until and the time catch up in their class I think I'll make it.	10	8	18
17946	7	I am writing about a time when I was patient. Me myself @CAPS1 not a patient person. One time I had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me. We were waiting on the bus to come but I was very angry because it seemed like it took forever to come. So my mother said @CAPS2 stop complanning and be patient @CAPS1 serious! so as soon as I sat down the bus came!	6	8	14
17949	7	Patience is to be quiet in lines wate to do some thing or going some were suntiel to be ??? and not ??? like ??? the wall and going crazy about wating for some thing wait to get a ??? game our wait to get a ticiket to go the the show to see a movie theis are way you could be pantient while do different thing in life.

17950	7	Being patience is hard to do, @CAPS1 I do remember a time when I was patient. This was at @CITY1. Me and my group had to wait for everyone to get back to the bus. We were the first ones to the bus so it took a while before they came. @CAPS1 before they did I was as calm and patient as can be.	6	5	11
17964	7	There once was a soldier named @CAPS7 connor. He is a private first class. His bestfriend named @PERSON1, he was also a private. I cant believe we have to wait six months before we actually get to deploy. @CAPS1 @CAPS7. @CAPS2 thats how its like man, @CAPS1 @PERSON1. They both @CAPS1 walking to the firing range. Ping! Went the target as the bullet struck it. @CAPS3 shot!, @CAPS1 @PERSON1. @CAPS5. @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Right in the center was the hole were the bullet struck. @CAPS7 had great aim but he still had to wait. Patience, @CAPS1 @PERSON1. @CAPS7 was patient and all but he wanted to go so bad. Finally his time came deployment. He  was so excited to go. One day on patrol his convoy was hit hard by mortors, he was killed in an instanct. In this story patience is the key to everything remember about patience next time you have to wait.	9	12	21

17980	7	This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @LOCATION1.There was a huge camp ground were you can reserve an area and camp there.The bad part was that it was about @NUM1 hours away. So i packed a magazine, some  paper my @CAPS1 and decided the best of it. Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing aganist each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour but as @CAPS4 played all i thought about was the camp. Later I was looking at a magazine about camping I didnt know it was about camping at first so that made me more exicited. Then i drew pictures for about an half an hour, that was fun.I ended up takeing up a nap for another half hour.  When I woke up I just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp. Finally @CAPS2 said @CAPS4 are here kids! @CAPS3! @CAPS4 all @CAPS5. @CAPS4 set up camp, played on the play ground,went swimming,and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it. But the ride home seemed alot quicker. Tthat is the story of a time I was patient	12	12	24
17988	7	The time when i was patient was when christmas came aroud. At first i just wanted christmas to get here. But my mom told me I had to just wait and  that it will come soon. So I waited and waited because I really wanted a wii consle and the sims @NUM1. So finally when christmass came i got what i wonna and some. Usually @CAPS1 not that patient but the reason I was is becaused my mom told me that it will come soon. I learned that when you really want something or really want to do something the more patient you are the faster it will come.	8	7	15
18002	7	"Once, I was @NUM1 old and I was so eager about getting a new bike I didn't have no patience at all, so that day I asked my dad can I get a new bike ""he said not now"" ""I said pleaseee"" he said later then, after that day my dad was getting dressed  I said yes!! That's for my bike so. I went to my dad and I told him I'm ready ""he said what"" were are you going I said with you then he said no not now, I got so angry and went and sat down. After an hour has been gone my dad showed up, so I ran so fast and said can we go now he said ali be patient, I said why you said we are going to go, so my dad parked the car and went downstairs and ate lunch. So I started to get angry I went to the couch and sat their and watched @CAPS1 while my dad was eating. After he was done he said ali lets go!! I said where, to? buy you a bike I ran so fast and hugged my dad and went and got dressed. After I got my new bike and I was patient."	5	7	12
18021	7	I was patient when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my @CAPS1.

The old man named @ORGANIZATION1 puts a blind fold on the boy named @CAPS3 and lets jolbs sand bags during at him. The first one hits him in the head, but the boy kicks the second one and busts it open. @CAPS2 grabs the third one and uses it to block the fourth one.

The nurse said that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 wasnt patient until her and her friend were talking. When the doctor was ready to see her she had forgot all about why she was there, @PERSON1 found out that she broke her arm. Later that day she thanked her mom and then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient.	8	9	17
18135	7	Patient, thats all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing.	4	8	12

But I dont see the rex I was said even thow I had like @NUM7 or more gifts. I still dont have that rex. So I sidely walk to my room. My mom came in my room with a big box.  Could it be!

18146	7	@CAPS1 back harder on the reighns! my teacher yelled @CAPS2 trying, but hes @CAPS8 not listening! @CAPS3 had to be the most stubborn horse I had @CAPS13 ridden in my life! @CAPS6 did whatever @CAPS6 wanted, whenever @CAPS6 wanted, and payed no attention to me at all. @CAPS4, @CAPS4 @CAPS8 bring him in. @CAPS6 said I slowly walked the horse into the center of the ring. @PERSON1, I really am trying, hes @CAPS8 not listening. I said I know @CAPS6 can be a bit hard-headed but I make you ride him because I believe you can handle him. @CAPS3 horses name was @PERSON3, @CAPS6 was a reddish-brownish color with big glassy brown eyes. @CAPS6 looked like a great horse that listened to its rider. Wrong! @CAPS6 was not nice or sweet and didnt listen at all! @CAPS8 walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter. @PERSON1 said. @CAPS4 fine. I replied. @CAPS8 as I was halfway around the ring, @PERSON3 stopped. Then @CAPS6 turned to his right, walked up to the window and started licking the water that beaded up on it. @PERSON2! What is @CAPS6 doing! @PERSON1 yelled I think @CAPS6 is licking the water off the windows. I said @CAPS10 get him away from there, @CAPS6 could get sick! @CAPS4, as I said earlier, @CAPS3 horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! @CAPS8 be patient @PERSON2. I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed a little and continued riding with no problems. I guess I @CAPS8 needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse @CAPS13 again.	9	12	21
18162	7	A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 took a few hours so here is @CAPS2 story. We were leaving the house when I realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog penny [she is real not fake] @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house and rest. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. @CAPS1s gonna be a long ride I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Daring @CAPS2 nap @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasnt nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned his gos and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.	8	11	19
18165	7	There was a time I was patient for a whole day! It was @CAPS1 eve and it was about @NUM1, meaning I just woke up, I ate breakfast brush my teeth after I got out of the shower. By now I would have probably ask my mom @NUM2 times if I could open one present, but on this day I hadn@CAPS6 ask he once yet. I was up string playing my play station when my mom called up @CAPS2!!!! I open my door and as usual my cat was right at my door I shut my door hop over my cat get to the stairs then yell food. He sewried down the stairs and right to the canter. As I start walking down the stairs I hear a @CAPS3!! So I start running down the stairs as fast as I could knowing my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They meet @CAPS7 at the counter and ask @CAPS7. @CAPS4 many times have you ask to open a present? @CAPS5 I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2 about @NUM5 minutes later I was done watch @CAPS6.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day.	8	9	17
18168	7	We had been patient enough on the plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient checking in. now was time for a true test of patience. We sat down at a table in a restaurant of the hotel. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, then dissappered. We got our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 min, @NUM2 min. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 min. after an hour we called her over and asked for bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread! We ask her where is our food. She promises to bring it out right away. We wait until weve been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We call the manager over to complain, and he brings out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got our food.	8	9	17
18170	7	It was @DATE1 when   my family and I went to cedar point. It was really exciting and fun. The trip was about three or six hours long. I went to sleep but when I wake up we was at burger king.  I ordered we a kids meal and it was good. so  as  we  got  back  in the  car I stayed up the  rest  of  the way there.  Then I start seeing water parks and hotels it was really nice. Then I seen this really tall roller coaster   I got really excited that I ran to the line, bed they were all long. I had a wait for @NUM1 minutes. When it was my tom in like  I was so  happy and  excited   that  when I got  my   stamp  I ran  to the @CAPS1-@CAPS2  in  door  roller  coaster. So I had to  wait  an hour  in line , so I got  really tired, but I kept mouing  forward, when I reached the  stairs  finally I got  on the  ride. I was binda scared at the sometime because it was dark. then  we  took off then it  got  off I was  dissy, but I went  on another  ride  and  got  disser. I got on this ride that rocks side to side. His is the time I was patient.	6	8	14
18175	7	I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1s gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said @CAPS6re leaking trannie fluid. @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). @CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip I said to @CAPS2, @CAPS6 dont know that for sure he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didnt help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 werent sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car.	10	12	22
18187	7	A time I was patient was in @DATE1 at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was about @NUM1 in the @TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes till the first @PERSON1 came on stage, the name of their @PERSON1 was @LOCATION2. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock @PERSON1. But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next @PERSON1 was one I new lots about; their name is the @PERSON1, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was @PERSON2, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about @LOCATION1 and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named @CAPS3. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did @NUM4?, and a @NUM5. It went @NUM2 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can @CAPS4. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about @NUM7 it was amazing. I will probly never whiteness something like that ever again!	12	9	21
18194	7	One time in @DATE1, I was taking a test called the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS1). Me, and my friends get down with the @ORGANIZATION1 early. So we had to be patient too. We had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @NUM1 minutes have gone by, sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace. One time me, and my dad were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like a few weeks. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal. A bad patience is when youre late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves. So you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace. @ORGANIZATION1.	7	6	13
18209	7	I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I new then when every one got done we waited for @NUM1 min then we start the meap again when I got done with that noone else was done so I waited for @NUM2 or @NUM3 min then every one was done then we stretched walked around for @NUM4 min then we sit back down and start the part @NUM5 when we are done we get to do work I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on my tests like meap test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.	8	8	16
18227	7	A time I was patience was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. adventures and we all wanted to go on the leaver water slide. The biggest water slide there. It had the longest line cher, it made a swerl and my family was at the end of the swerl. I was early morning when we had finally get in and went to the leaver water slide. It was huge just about @NUM1 feettall. And we got in line and only an half an hour had gone by when my mom let it. Then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. Now it was only my my other brother my sister, and my dad is left in line. When some one got hurt on the ride and the shut it down for two hours. Finally they opened up the ride again so now my other brother and sister did not come with us. So now it is only my dad and me left in the line now. So it was our turn on the ride next when my dad get scard end left so it was me and an old man went on the same little fletch. The old man met his pance and l was so happy to finally get on.	10	8	18
18230	7	One day @PERSON1s mom, @CAPS1 decited to go shoping and @PERSON1 despretly wanted to go. But his mom kept saying @CAPS2. So @PERSON1 begged and begged s his mom finally said, @CAPS3 but you cant complain so @PERSON1 went shoping with his mom. Then @PERSON1 and his mom arrived at the store. Just about @DATE1 @PERSON1 said. Im board can we go now, his mom @CAPS4 @CAPS2 just be patient. @PERSON1 then said, patient you want me to be patient weve been here for like  @DATE1 hours, we have only been here for ten @DATE1. I have @CAPS2 more patients said @PERSON1. So so his mom made a deal with @PERSON1 it was, if you be good for @NUM1 more @DATE1 we will go to the ice cream place. The next @NUM1 @DATE1 made his mom go crazy with every second @PERSON1 saying, Im board can we go now and hurry up. Finally @PERSON1 and his mom left. They got in the car and drove right past the ice cream place, @PERSON1 said, wait we past it, his mom said I know. @PERSON1 said we made a deal, remember. It is mom said yup but you broke the deal, so what did you learn. @PERSON1 said that when you make a deal sign a contract, his mom said, @CAPS2 patients is a virtue that you need to learn. So that is my story about patients in my own way.	8	9	17
18240	7	"I remmeber a time when I was six I was waiting In the walking clinil @CAPS1 almost @NUM1 hours so l asked them if  they could change the @LOCATION1 channel  to @ORGANIZATION1, after  @CAPS2 got over I @CAPS3 asleep @CAPS2 @CAPS5 like forever @CAPS1 them to say ''@CAPS6 salslory,"" my mom tried wakeing me up she couldn't until I @CAPS7 off the cach seat that they had In the kid's are. I was there at the walking clinic @CAPS1 one reason my athsmua @CAPS2 bad @CAPS1 a while because I'd been sick. Whe  they called me dawm my mom said that I was really patient and the nurse evan  said I was actually Patient to be patient that long so she gave me a lolly pop, (small one). After all of that was done I went home and went to bed. Thats the time I was Patient @CAPS1 two hours."	8	8	16
18252	7	One time. My cousin in patient because she was going to the mouie @CAPS1 a party. @CAPS1 it was a lot of kids at her house @CAPS1 she had to clean up the house before her mom come home. Also @CAPS2 that day she called our entire mom but they didnt pick up @CAPS2 she hurry up @CAPS1 tried to clean before he boyfriend came over. Then she hurry up @CAPS1 get in the tub then got out put the the kids @CAPS1 the  tub. She still had to clean up then she us what to clean up. @CAPS2 she rush out the @CAPS1 left us there while go get us something to eat @CAPS2 we clean up while. She is gone. Then she called me and said. I m on my way with food I said oh. Next her boyfriend came @CAPS1 he ready to go. She came back the house was clean. Then her mom came home @CAPS2 went in the room in change he clothe s her mom said where a going. She said to the mouie and a party her moma said no you not go clean up the bathroom first she got mad and said moma   I been in  patien all day I m ready to go. @CAPS2 she wash it go @CAPS1 then they left.	6	8	14
18253	7	Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant. Well Im going to tell you about someone who is patience. My friend @PERSON1 is very patience person. @PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her wait she listens and waits. When her parents were talking, and when she was trying to tell them something they told her to wait because it is rude when you interrupt adults when there talking. @PERSON1 is a very patience person.	8	4	12
18256	7	This @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 the part cucry one forgets is the @NUM1 hour plane ride. We were in a group of @NUM2 familis all my friends. When we become the plane we were an exited, @CAPS1 on gate were scattered all over. So I sat with my @NUM3 favorite friends in that trip. We were all loaded with as electicails the enemes. As we foot on I thought @CAPS3 was going to be a breeze, @CAPS1 thought wrong. At first @CAPS3 was fine we talkes and played games in our I pods and sort, @CAPS1 after like @NUM2 hours we started setting itchy and our I pods died. So then we decided to watch a movie as our mind dvd player. @CAPS3 was starling to irn low on battery and the plan was broken. The thing died and we still had like another @NUM2 hours and we only got to watch one movie. On the back of each seat there was a tv so we forced @CAPS3 on, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 was one of @NUM6 of the???did not ???. We started to see really??? and @CAPS3 was getting late. We didn't know what to do @CAPS3 was hopeless .We had to sit and wait if out sit was a true talk of patience. We??? @NUM3 home??? @CAPS3 was the longest @NUM3 horrs ever. We did nothing. @CAPS1 as we wanted we bolted out of our seats and into the air read @CAPS3 was over. We didn't have to be patient no longer.	11	11	22
18257	7	Patients for me is hard but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didnt have my physical. So while everyone was playing volleyball me and @NUM1 other people were sitting and watching for @NUM2 @DATE1!!!. I wasnt vary patient then but @DATE1 on at the end of the tryouts my mom came to pick me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctors office thingy, so I could get my physical done. So me and my mom went in and she had to sign and fill out paper work because she didnt make me all appointment. So that took about @NUM3 min. then we waited, and waited, and waited until @NUM4 and @DATE1 if you add that up this @NUM2 @DATE1 waiting there with nothing to do. I was patient but my mom definitely wasnt. So finally they called me in and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for @NUM3 min. then finally they gave us the paper/ physical, and then we left. Practice ended at @NUM7 and we didnt get home until @NUM8!!!. That is a time I was patient.	8	12	20
18260	7	Patience @CAPS3 a sense of tolerance. Having the patience means that you can wait, it will come to you if you just wait. like when you gobble your food down thinking its going to he stolen, when really, you could have left it there and yet it would still there. Patience @CAPS3 knowing that everything @CAPS3 going to be ok and you have time. Having patience to do somthing, @CAPS3 to take your time, or go at your own pace believing you will finish. Patience @CAPS3 qenrally how long you can wait to do somthing, or even put up with something. Patience could also mean now long you can put up with somthing, like a bully for instance. He or she makes fun you again and again. But how long, how much patience do you have before your just pushed off the edge and you cant take it any more! THAT@CAPS1 @CAPS2 PATIENCE @CAPS3.	6	7	13
18269	7	My dad is a very patient person. Hes known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited a whole @NUM1 years just to get one lense for it. Because he was patient. My mom is very patient. My mom is patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers, because she was patient. Im proud to have such patient parent. Which means that I know they are very responsible and that is what I think patient is.	9	5	14
18285	7	Patience is a very important value. To sacced you need patience. I have used patience in my life when I got my first horse. I needed patience with her because she was stubborn, self- centered ,and poorly trained. I had to teach her moves at a slow pace so she could remember how she was supposed to do it. I also needed patience for her because she had just moved to the present home and didnt recognize the surroundings. These though, are only some of the ways patience has appeared in my life	8	8	16
18291	7	What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient.	11	11	22
18292	7	Two years ago my dad had surgery on his because he broke it at work .I had to sit in a waiting  room  for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do .Every two hours my mom ,grandma ,grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch .After about four hours I got really  tired ,but didnt fall asleep .That was the longest Ive sat in one place my entire life .At first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half it only seemed like two .	8	8	16
18293	7	I am patient in a lot of stof, when I play I am patient. When I take a test I am patient. I am almost patient in everything. Lots of people are patient too. Some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer there not patient. They just want to take the ball and score. One time I was playing at the park with my friends I was playing soccer my friend told me to pass the ball. He was not patient at all that day.	5	6	11
18295	7	One day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told and security took us back to the end of the line. We where mad and my dad was losing his patients too. We wait for hours till it was finally our turn. We wait that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time l lost my patients.	8	8	16
18296	7	The time I was patients with my little brothers! I was baby sitting and they wouldnt lison to me or my other sister and I just relaxed and got on the floor and played with them after that all went well.	4	4	8
18308	7	Some people a completely patient. Some people arent patient at all. But me; I sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patientce, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If its @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When were going somewhere special, or Im trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! Its like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I cant always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when Im cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though Im super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesnt come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you dont have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Dont get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers arent always patient either. I think we should just try to be patient as we can, all the time!	6	6	12
18319	7	its where?  The woman asked for the third time. @CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms, I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didnt say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often dont meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  @CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of youngs incorporated.  @CAPS3, youre with youngs?  @CAPS4 asked.   Do you know where the show room is?  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  @CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.  I said in a robotic voice.  @CAPS6t  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  @CAPS8, sir.  @CAPS9 old are you?  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  @CAPS11, sir. I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high schooler,  so I knew @CAPS4d  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. Are you getting paid?  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  yes,  sir.  But its @CAPS12 a lot.  Its more like volunteer work,  really.  @CAPS13 dont ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  thanks son. Youre welcome.  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think well both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dads shop, because if @CAPS4 didnt, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient.	12	12	24
18338	7	Being Patient by: @PERSON1 A few years ago, I started to horse back ride. I love it so muc h.  About @NUM1 month ago I ordered new riding boots. This is a time when I defien tly had to be patient. Me and my mom went on stake line tack.corn and ordered  my new boots. When they arrived, they were too  small so, we sent them back. Days and days went by as I waited for my boots. They didnt come. I had to be patient. Another day went by and my mom finally called them. They said when you re-ship something,  I goes through fourteen day processing. Both me and my mom had to be patient. Weeks went by and still no boots. My mom have gotten a new credit card that week.  Another week went by and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card, it said declined. But @CAPS1 the problem is fixed and Im glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 riding comfortably in my new riding boots.	9	11	20
18352	7	One important skill you need in the life is patience. With my new, hard cast on my arm, I couldn't do many things. I was a very active child doing soccer, basketball, cross country, and football. But, with my broken arm I had to be patient with my sports. Being patient payed off and my arm healed faster without becoming but even more. Then I played sports after a had my coat cut off. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough.	8	9	17
18381	7	"@CAPS4 I'm patient, and sometime I'm impatient. But no matter how impatient l am, my @CAPS5's even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs at the long delay, sighs, and gets very impatient. He says things like, @CAPS1 on, @CAPS2"" ""@CAPS1 on!""  @CAPS4 it's scary to be with @CAPS5 in traffic jams, or long lines. But after the long line. @CAPS5's himself again which is a great relief on my past!"""	12	8	20
18383	7	A time that I was patient was when I was fighting my little brother in @LOCATION1 and then he kicked me in the chin and I promised him that I would not tell on him even when I busted my chin open the second time he kicked me and I fell to the ground right in front of everybody else and then I was being swarmed like a bunch of bees around a hive full of honey. That was when I was being patient.	5	6	11
18390	7	In this story I am wating a hut the time when the video game @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was coming at for @CAPS3 @NUM1. The game will be the last game for the comcay bunsie.

18398	7	As my dad allways tells me, patient is one of the vary begs to being successful in life. As I mature I find out more and more that patients is important. I remember a time when I had to display patients for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to ceadar point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 ride gave me the most fan, heartstopping, andrenalin pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, I began to get tired. After @NUM1 hours of walking we reached the mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. I was disapointed to find out its a @NUM1:30 hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figure the best way to do @CAPS1 was to keep quiet and relax. It seems that the more you complain the longer it takes. And before we knew it we were about to get to get on the ride!	10	9	19
18435	7	A time I was patience was one time we were @CAPS4 the store and I was @CAPS2 excited to go to the toys section. @CAPS1 we were goin to have go to the grocerys first, said mom. I was really mad and mom said be patice the quicker we do this the faster well get to the toys.  @CAPS2 we are @CAPS3 done with the grocery and then we have to go to the clothes section. I was really really mad. Mom said the quicker we do this the fast we get to the toys. @CAPS3, I had to try on clothes. I hate try I on clothes, I said. Then I was @CAPS2 excited because we go to go to the toys selection I was @CAPS2 happy. I looked, an look an then mom said I could pick out a toy. @CAPS4 was @CAPS2 hard to choose I didnt what to pick till I saw a cool truck. @CAPS4 had big tries @CAPS4 had flames and @CAPS4 was green. I asked and please please? An mom siad @CAPS5 u can get I was @CAPS2 happy. And that was a time I was paticene.	8	10	18
18444	7	One day my mom said I could get this new toy at the store but my mom had to do other things before we went to the store so I had to be patient. My mom had to go to where she works because she forgot something. Then she had to go to the gas station. Then we finally went to the store and I got the toy that I wanted.	8	4	12
18449	7	One day I was at the store with my friends. I picked out my slurpee and inline to buy my slurpee. then an old lady got in line. So to be nice I let her in front of me. @CAPS1 a while she found out that she was a dollar short. So I gave her a dollar. She turned to me said thanks and gave me a mint @CAPS1 I bought my slurpee, me and my friends had to cross the road. We sat their for @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes but it seemed like an hour. We crossed the road and walked to my house. On the way to my house my friend hold to use the restroom. So we went to the market. We had to wait for a hour before he came back out of the market. he told us he got lost. We walked home and on that day, I learned that its tough to be patient.	8	8	16
18460	7	I time I was patient is when we had to do mcap teats. I was one of the first ones done so I had to sit quitly and read. I read most of my book. It took about an hour for evrey one to finish. it was vary long time to read. I got board but I sat quite so people could finish, and so I wouldent be disrptintt. Thean when evry one finshed we took a batheroom brack.	9	6	15
18476	7	@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3 I can hear the clock ticking ,probly to annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small classroom building. Every body is on the edge of their chairs waiting, why does @CAPS4 seem so long? Its almost @NUM1 minute now.the aroma of peperoni  pizza is so strong that I can practicly taste @CAPS4. This is agony. My stomach rumbles, so hungry. @NUM2 seconds can I wait that long @NUM3 Im not sure. The tension ogf the whole class is so great,I think my brain will erupt. I cant take this, @CAPS4s way to much. My eyes flash nervously to the @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 seems to be an eternity, @CAPS4 couldnt have been just a few seconds could @CAPS4? @CAPS4 must have been at least years. @NUM5 why is time so short? Im not a very patient, not at all. But do I have any amount of patience? If I do Im not seeing @CAPS4 got. Im about to just jump out of my seat as if Im ejected from a @DATE1. Im trying to hold still, but anxiety is getting to me. If I knew that Id be this anxious for lunch that I would have had breakfast. Were down to @NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. @CAPS4s enough to crush me now. I think I might make @CAPS4 @NUM7. My stomach rumbles again,brouse this time, begging for food, @CAPS5, demanding is more like @CAPS4. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,the clock nocking me, taunting me @NUM8 seconds I cant bare this much longer. I think am about to snap. I dont handle patience well. @CAPS4s a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off @NUM9 seconds. @CAPS4 seems the bomb and clock are counting down together. Both anticipating my snap. Ill show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have @NUM10, @CAPS10! finaly, the bell goes of signaling lunch time . I zoomed out like a squirrel who just sat on a snow cone.	8	12	20
18489	7	My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to chang the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and Im not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very invoked because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining and when I finally frosted on that didnt break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, bat she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go to slow, instead of yealing at me to harry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must of taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a @CAPS1 amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, anything in the recipe that could be dropped I dropped it, I also never wanted to stay clean it up and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor. My grandma is always patient with me no matter what I do.	12	9	21
18499	7	Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced of the arm rest with every one movement. I had asked my @CAPS1 to hurry up @CAPS2 I wouldnt be late. I had told her like I have a million times before, @CAPS1, you know how much being on time for practice means to me. @CAPS2 I sat there slummped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens @CAPS7 the time, I thought my @CAPS1 would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunatly, with every flip, I became more irretated. @CAPS3 is she? Why is she taking @CAPS2 long? @CAPS4 like these swirled in my head. Then, my @CAPS1 came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling, the garage door crecked open. My @CAPS1 started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed @NUM1, I for sure new that I wasnt going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @NUM2 and took deep breathes. Taking lots of deep breathes helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. @CAPS5 passient. I told myself. @CAPS5 passient. Relax, youll make it there. @CAPS7 of a sudden my @CAPS1 slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read @NUM3. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and @CAPS7 you had to do was slow down and @CAPS5 passient. Great job	12	12	24
18506	7	One time me and my dad were at a store.There was a line about @NUM1 people my dad and I were starting to get impatient so I told myself to calm down and wait.

18519	7	The best ride at @ORGANIZATION1 was over @NUM1 hours long wait. Bad news for me become I am definintaly not a patience person. Like this one time I was waiting in line for an ice cream. There was only two people in line but I didnt want to wait so I didnt want one anymore. Thats how impatience I was, but riding the best ride in the world I was willing to wait. Two hours of waiting in line we seen a sign that said one hour from this @ORGANIZATION1. Very mad I kept saying to myself its the best ride you can wait an hour longer so I did. When we got on the ride it was fun but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds longer	8	8	16
18526	7	When I have patient is when I go out to eat. So no one can speat in, my food. Like one time I went out to eat with my family. And we all was dress alike for my birthday. So I ask my daddyto tell them that my birthday is to day. And I wanted a piece of cake now. So he want to tell what I said and they ??? give us a minute. So I waited and waited. And finly said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place brun down. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. So they finly bring my cake. And they sang happy birthday to me. And I was happy after that in tell I found out they speat in my food and ate itto. I had found out because before I lifte I heard some people talking about how they speat in my food. Then I said wait did you in the fries they said yea. Then I said o I don`t care cause I didnt eat the fries. They said why I because I the fries is neasty. And I rolled my eyes and walked away. But I don`t  do that because I scared somebody would do it again. That is why I have patience.	8	8	16
18528	7	We climbed in the rental car waving goodbye to realitives as we drive back to the airport. I cant believe that the airport had an opening earlier in the day and called us? Exclaimed my @CAPS4. @CAPS1 I cant either. I mean out of all- Were here! Man that was quick. As we rolled into the airport smelling that strafoam smell, and checked in our bags. @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 @NUM1, @CAPS3. @CAPS4 explained to the clerk @CAPS5 sorry according to this your @CAPS10 is full she told us through a chessy smile. @CAPS6 you called saying there was empty seats and invited us to exchange @CAPS2. @CAPS5 sorry @CAPS6 it wouldnt be fair if we gave away @CAPS2 that were rightful owned. @CAPS8 again another chessy smile @CAPS6 you can have your orginal @CAPS2 back if you like, @NUM2 @LOCATION2. @NUM2! What am I going to do for seven hours! First my brother and I had races up and down the escelators. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere. By @NUM4 I knew the place inside out. Soon it time to leave suddenly the speaker came on @CAPS10 @NUM5 to @LOCATION2 has been deylayed by an hour and a half @NUM6 now really? Luckly my @CAPS4 took me to an extotic restraunt.

Its not hard @CAPS6 not impossible.	11	12	23
18541	7	One time I was patient because I was hunting it was a cold @DATE1 play I am sitting in blind with my dad waiting for a deter. It`s almost eight o clock and we have been out there since @NUM1.

Then out at nowhere at @TIME1AM then came another doe. They went by us with caution so I got the gun ready. Then out came the eight point bunch I shot him through the heart and lung. I also gutted him. The year at @DATE2 in the youth hunt I was patient and it paid off.	11	12	23

The other was just a car bolt. @PERSON3 had bone bugs for the @DATE1 and was putting inside air @NUM3. Then @CAPS9 asked himself, Was it worth it? cee-yes @CAPS28-friend	12	12	24
18597	7	Have you ever been a patient? Like at the @CAPS1s office?  Well let me tell you a time I have. One time I was really sick and I started crying because I was in a lot of pain. I was crying for an hour straight. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying. I told my mom that I stopped crying but she told me that I had to go see the @CAPS1.  When we went in we seen this man rushed to the @LOCATION1.  We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out she asked a man in to see her with his son. That gave us two seat to sit in.  After about @CAPS2 minutes she called us in to a medical room. She examined me and I was really scared because I might have nomonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office I was holding my moms hand. She came unto us holding piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection.  When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about ? @NUM1. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full, I felt like a pancake under another pancake.  When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about @TIME1 I got to have the lollypop. That was a time when I was patient.	9	9	18
18635	7	A time when I was patient was on the city bus. So me and my mom could go to walmart. We waited for @NUM1 hours till we got there. Before we got on we had to pay a @MONEY1 each. Then ask for transfer very nicely. T hen hop on another bus then get off and go shopping. Then wait till bus comes back and go home after @NUM1 hours. Then get of bus at the corner and walk back to the house.	6	8	14
18648	7	In @DATE1 my dad had a business trip in @CAPS1 dinsney land. We got to the park and rode some rides .My dad had to leave for a meeting, so he did. After a while I saw something cool, space @CAPS2. I got in line and I saw a sign, @NUM1 hours until lift off! My mom was shocked so we left. I was so disapointed. We came back the next day and the wait was @NUM2 hours. We got in line and waited and waited and waited. After @NUM3 minutes I was bored. I asked my mom if we could leave but the line was to big to get out. After hours that seemed like years we got to the front, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom got out of line and so did my sister, but I stay. I waited all by myself for @NUM4 minutes when I got on the coaster! It was fun, and I got a fastoas for @NUM5 other rides! In the end my patience paid off.	10	8	18
18664	7	Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4t have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but heres a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like theres no tomorrow. To bad I couldnt play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience.. @CAPS1 ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face.  @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing he added. @CAPS4t get to happy , theres still plenty of time left. I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, who is the loser now, huh? wow all it took was patient, and hope I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate whats happening around you, youll end up getting rewarded!.	10	9	19
18669	7	The day I was patient is was at campand I was on it ?? course the person in front of me ??to so up so I had to be patient.when I got up and wentthrew the first ???obstacle he was waiting on the platform. I had to wait until they took him down.then I finally got to go out when I got half way thruw the obstacle they told me I had to be patient and wait until all the people got off that platform. It took a couple of minutes but then I finally got to go ??? that was the day I had to be patient	8	8	16
18689	7	Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, itll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have.	4	4	8
18696	7	"Ugh, what is taking the gym teacher @CAPS14 long? @PERSON1 whined. ""@CAPS1's been hours"" ""@CAPS1's only been @NUM1 minutes."" @PERSON2 said.

""@CAPS12're gonna get in trouble."" @PERSON2 said, looking down. ""@CAPS13 was just yelling:"" yelled the gym teacher with an angry face. The gym teacher looked to his right and saw @PERSON1 behind stage and said ""@CAPS12 couldn't played basketball but @PERSON1 messed @CAPS1 up for everybody."" @CAPS14 nobody played because @PERSON1 didn't have any patience. @CAPS14 I hope today he'll have a little more patience hopefully."	11	9	20
18712	7	Being patience is when someone could be bisy is just better to be patience while the other person is done. I am going to write about a time when someone I know was being patience. Well on one morning my mom had got out of work when she came I told my mum that I really wanned to go over my friends house. But my mom just keept on saying to wait and so I had to wait so I did? My mom wasnt even done still so I told her if I could go working to my friends house. But she said no and that I had to be patience till she was done. My dad was living to his work in the afternoon so I had an idle. I told my dad if he could drop me off my friends house and then he could live to his work. So I did I went to tell him. But guess what he said no coz he was already late and I looked at the time and yhea he was already late so I dicided to just be patience coz my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving so I just sat down and watched tv while my mom was done. My mum had went insid the room and so I got up and asked if she was done and she said yes I so yelled so you are tackeing me and so she did I was so happy I rushed to the car and so we went and I went and my mom had left and that was the day I got to go to my friends house for just being patience.	8	6	14
18718	7	Time I was patient was when my friend was coming over I was excited. But I waited and waited. But she finna @CAPS1. Thats about it.	4	3	7
18731	7	A  time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister , my niece, and I were going to the barber shop at @NUM1. I was getting my hair cut by a official barbor. I waited all the way to @NUM2 to get my hair cut. That was a time I was patient	9	6	15
18733	7	@PERSON1 was your average fourteen year old. @CAPS5 had a @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and an annoying eight year old brother named @PERSON2. @CAPS9 parents werent that eligble with names. It was ?? beggering of school and @CAPS9 @CAPS3 had to take @LOCATION1 clothes shopping . Problem is @CAPS5 made @LOCATION2 go in. @CAPS5 wouldnt complain for a month. @CAPS11, oh @CAPS11, did @CAPS5 have to be a ??! Sigh. Oh well, too late now. @PERSON1 thought here @CAPS5 was, in the boys department helping @CAPS9 @CAPS1 pick not clothes for @ORGANIZATION1. Out of he comes of @CAPS9 eye @CAPS5 sees getting more, daring to get a better look, @CAPS5 gasped @CAPS5 could fail to have @CAPS6 some guys for he school since @CAPS9 pick out clothes in the boys department! I stared, @CAPS5 need is to the girls bathroom and stay there until @CAPS9 were to get @CAPS9. The dare ?? was awkward. @CAPS8 for being so understanding. @CAPS9 @CAPS1 said. I know that was laid for you and @CAPS8 agot @CAPS9 not complaining. @PERSON1 what, @CAPS8, @CAPS10. @CAPS11 being patient is a good thing. @CAPS5 thought as @CAPS5 got out of the class.	11	11	22
18739	7	When you have patience you are colmer peace full and happy. It is like when you  birth day is next week and you dont want to wait for it and have to get mad be cases you want your presents today not next week. But you cant so you get mad start to hit things and than you dont get a good behaver. Then you make your parents made then they bring some of you gifts back to they store that is not patience. That is non patience when you get mad becomes   you cant get what you want.	4	4	8
18756	7	Who likes being patient its so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know its good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but theyre lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldnt wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didnt complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you cant do it just be patient and it will pay off.	11	10	21
18759	7	"One night, when me, @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister, @PERSON1, were asleep. Our parents were on the computer. @CAPS4 usually don't stay up that late. So I just thought @CAPS2 was doing something for work. In the @TIME1, when we wake up, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen with smiles on their faces. @CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. ""I wonder @CAPS3 it could be."" I thought. I asked @CAPS9 mom ""@CAPS3's going on!?!"" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowely brought up a document from behind his back presenting it to us. The heading on the document said ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8."" @CAPS9 parents were smirking @CAPS11 @CAPS9 sister and I stared at each other in amazement. @CAPS11 if we were reading each other's mind, we both well knew that we were going on a cruise! I grinned excitedly and looked at the @CAPS15 on the paper. ""@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2.'' it said. Today was @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2 ""That's like, two months away!!!.""  ""@CAPS10,"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, ""you must be patient."" @CAPS11 normal kids did. I said ""@CAPS12"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 knew @CAPS9 disappointment and said ""@CAPS14 things come to those who wait. I nodded contently. I knew that I was going to have to rough the two months out and be patient. The first couple weeks felt like mont's to us. We were oh so anxious @CAPS11 you would guess. But, @CAPS11 time progressed the patient got easier. I was able to focus on other things beside the cruise. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, the time come for us to head on a plane for the cruise."" That quick! It went by that quick! I m so excited, @CAPS2! I said when we were boarding the plane. ""I'm proud of you, son. You we're patient!"" That's the time of how I learned to be patient! @CAPS11 @CAPS9 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS14 things will come to those who wait."""	11	12	23

18790	7	Patience is when you get in a long line at the grocery store when you are waiting for a new video game. That happened to me when I was on the great jorney to california. I had to stand in six very long line for up to @NUM1 hours it took forever to get on the plain when we finaly got there we were hungry so we had to wait inline for @NUM2 minutes when we were finally up to get our food we were starving we ate and went to a friends house we stayed  for an hour it started to get bouring but I had  patience and  waited  turns out it was not so bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life wether you are or arnt patient is up to you that week was all about patients and lines lots of both it was a long day. Sadly we had to leave after that day which equals. Yap you guessed it for patience first was had to go huston, texas then @ORGANIZATION1  then we had to drive  @NUM3 hours to get home when we got home we were so tired  and passed the story to my friends and family.	7	9	16
18791	7	To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousins house to watch her daughter @CAPS1 @PERSON1 , for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldnt wait.When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldnt hush. Tthen I said,  @NUM1 , whats the matter ? @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because  I stayed somewhat calm and I didnt complain to @CAPS1@CAPS4s mom.	11	12	23
18803	7	My friend was waiting for @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad, my dad was busy fixing his @CAPS1. He was waiting, waiting, and waiting till he fixed it. I was wondering what the question was. He was sitting inside, watching tv waiting for him to be finished. Then my dad was done so my friends asked if we could ride the @CAPS1. My dad said yes. My friend was being patient.	7	8	15
18805	7	@CAPS1 are we there yet? I keep asking over and over again. @CAPS2 but almost, he replied. Today we are going to @LOCATION1 adventures and I am so excited! After I asked my @CAPS1 when we would be there, about @NUM1 minutes later we finally arrived at @LOCATION1 adventures! The line  to get are tickets was long but not to long. Once we get them we went to go look for a lock to put all of are stuff in! The line far that wasnt long so we did that fast! We were now all hungry, so we went to go eat! The time we got into the restaurant, the lines to order were very long! Ok, so now that we are all done eating, it was time to ride some awesome e rides! @CAPS3, man! is what I would get saying when the lines to the rides were super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, ok say I had to go change my clothes to go into the water park and change back or go to the restroom man these lines were super long too! Now that the day is almost done, and the park will be closing, my family and I arent into the gift shop: we were in the for about @NUM1 minutes waking around. When we were done and we were ready to check out, the check out line wasnt long at all! Finally, there was a line that wasnt long! All that day I was a very patient girl! Between everything that went on throughout that day!	8	11	19
18824	7	One day I asked my parents if I could buy this game that I wanted and this game that I wanted and they asked me how much is it? I said that I did not know how much it is. So he said that we would go to the store and see how much it is.

When we went to the mall me saw that it was @MONEY3 and so I finally got to buy it.	8	6	14
18836	7	Patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outdoor mail with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After ward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home!	9	8	17
18875	7	One time I was patient was when me and three other of my friends were hanging out at school one day. We were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile. Since its a relay one person goes to run a mile, then the second person goes once the first person I done, after that the third person goes after the second person is done with his mile, then finally after the third person went I got to go run a mile because I was the fastest at running a mile. Since I had to wait until the very end I had to have patience to wait and then finally go.	8	9	17

18954	7	There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were getting @NUM1 pug puppies from a nice lady who lived @NUM2 minutes away. I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs. I guess good things really do come to those who wait!	10	12	22

We played songs and had tests to everyone we were playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed something funny on my tests. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long  private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school. I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> broke down the notes for us one by one. He told me  the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again and together. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them being ?? patient with me. Then  finally I was playing every note .The lesson was about @NUM4 minutes and he was patient the entire process. Now i play my notes right thats to the lesson and @PERSON1s patience. Now I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on <@NUM2</PERSON>s patience to come out or there is ?? required classes.	11	8	19

Our coach has in teach us stuff like the @CAPS1 play and teach us how to do moves like cross overs. She teaches us to run fast, she has to be patient with the slower kids that cant ran as fast. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them all and it for a little of her time , so she had to be patient.	9	7	16

Patience is @CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunties and even you and I need (@CAPS1 in these days and times. We about need it every day.) @CAPS2 does the key word patience mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant.  Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining. Or in my own words, long suffering and also are able to wait until @CAPS2 you want is done. Being patient is something that I am not all the time but, need to be. Like my daddy say to me all the time you are not going to always get or receive everything you want to so youll have to learn patience. That is one word I do not like @CAPS1 when its something I really want.so that is my story about patience explained my way.	5	4	9

19173	7	Im going to tell you about a time when I showed patience. When my family and my mom boy friend when on vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there it was pack full of people. So we jumped in line for the first ride. We were so excited that the @PERSON2 said @NUM1 teen minet wait. At first the line was moving very fast. There all of the sudden it moving like a sloth. It was so hot and humid that was alful. We checked the time it was @NUM2 minet already. It felt like @NUM3 hours. I was running out of pashents. Then we got in the shade it was a cool and nice. Finiy we were the next rid we got out the and one nice. @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 where so happy. My mom boy friend timed the rid it was only @NUM4 seconds long. We waited @NUM5 hour for a @NUM4 second rid. That was one time that I should patience.	8	10	18
19174	7	Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I dont know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didnt care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasnt like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I m daddys little girl? I think you couldve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. Thats when daddys little girl comes in handy!	9	12	21

She set the timer for @NUM2 minets! I did not think I could wait that long. My magnt waterd at the small. I was dying I wanted them so bad! I thought the smell could kill me! Every minet semed like an houre. Then the timer buzed I sprinted, over ther, grabed a plate tossed @NUM3 of the bigest cookes on the plate, while doing so I burned my hand. But I did not care I took a bite out of a cooke my water was over. My patieates payed off in the end I t was so word in it for the cookes I got.	8	8	16

When we pulled up to the tickit booth the man in the little booth said tickit please. @CAPS5 we pulled up to get a parking spot. I hen we got out & ran for the gates. But just then @CAPS8 sister forgot her towel. @CAPS5 I ran back to the truck & got @CAPS4. Then we got into our bathing sutes. Then we went to the water. The first ride I did was the @CAPS6 of @CAPS7! @MONTH1 I mind you @CAPS4 was very scary. But I said, dose any one want to go with me? @CAPS8 dad& @CAPS8 moms friend from work said yes! @CAPS5 we got in the line. The line was like @NUM2 to @NUM3 people in the line. @CAPS5 the wait was around @NUM4 hours! But I did not complain one bit. But then we heard a blood curtling scream from the ride. Then a man, women & @NUM4 young kids got spit out into the pool. Then we got their tube & went up the stairs. We got up to the huge opening to where you could see the @NUM6 foot dropoff then the brite pink & yellow funnle. About @NUM7 minutes later we were at the port where you get on your tube. @CAPS5 we went down. @CAPS8 moms friend (@PERSON1) went down backwards. I said yes, you go to go down backwards. Halla! @CAPS5 we started going down & then we just dropped (well we freefalled) but we were going like @NUM8 mph. @CAPS4 was scary. Then we got sit out. Then I fell into the pool &got out. I scean @CAPS8 mom & was two sisters. They laughed at @PERSON1 because she was crying. Then she said she didnt feel good. @CAPS5 she went to the truck & took a nap. Then I rode rides the rest of the @TIME1. That is a time I was patient.	12	8	20
19237	7	One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young ones playing and laughing carelessly. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird o. not to be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient.	11	12	23
19240	7	Being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a @DATE1 and my mom woked me up at @NUM1 she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didnt know that I was going to have to be paitent the whole day. First on our way to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about @NUM2 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum Im ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life.	9	7	16
19257	7	When I was patient I was sitting at a restront. And I ordered my drink and mike was the first one. Then when we got our food they said it will take about five more minutes so I sat there it was fifteen minutes later when she came back and made the wrong food so I was losing my patients. so then I just relaxed. She came back with my meal thes time it was. The right one so I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast so when I was done they gave me a free descont because of the mixup they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such great patient`s I had. And thats when I was very patient.	8	8	16
19280	7	On the way back home from a doctors??? .I was getting annoyed about being??? I did not want mom to get annoyed more. So I tryed  a great to be pacient. Once a while I would play with the seat .@NUM1 minutes have passed and I was getting more in patient. Buy I still keep +roln  .Once I got home I went to bea  and relaxed	5	7	12
19282	7	Being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school how do you use patience. A way is being understanding to your teacher because theyre there to help you to teach you for life. If you dont be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them they were tolerant with you. If you dont have patience with you parents and dont listen to them then you wont learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life.	5	5	10
19294	7	One christmas about a year or two ago we drove up to my grandparents house. They live in cold water so it took about @NUM1 hours. All my relatives on my dads side were there. All the presents were under the tree and I couldn`t wait to open. The parents were just talking about nonsense, so I opened my big mouth and said can we open presents now, we stated to open the presents but the adults had to go first. They are the slowest gifts openers ever I was about to rip the presents out of their hand`s and open the presents I didn`t do that thought because I was being patient. After they finished I said,yes of course thought my little cousins had to open next. Let me tell you they aren`t fast at all either. After that I finally got to open my presents. In the end it was worth it I got an x-box @NUM2, and over @MONEY1. That was the time I was patient.	9	9	18
19297	7	A time when I was patient. I am patient when I go hunting. I know that at an moment the back of a life time could walk out in shouting range. And if one does I will be ready. The first time I shot a deer was with my baw. And I remember siting there being as patient as I could waiting for a deer to step within range. Then l hear the leaves cranching . The there it is the deer Im going to shout?? How you draw it back. Than I shoot I could feel the arrow gliding throw my bow. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud and the deer takes off. I wanted there in my tree stand ready to go blame my deer. Me and my dad traked it about soft and there it was. I was so excited that all yelled. It was nice to know that all my patients and hard work had payed of. Thank you for reading my story. Hope you enjoyed it.	10	9	19
19310	7	A time I was patient was when I had to be patient for having a difficult task without any hep. Not one comeint from me. It was so hard. I had one hour to finish it. I needed three hours to finish. It was so hard not even collage student could finish I t. @ORGANIZATION1 was the hardest match test I ever done.	5	5	10
19314	7	??? ??? ??? was about the mid of @DATE1 my family and I were going to ??? @LOCATION1. ???/ mid @LOCATION1. I was so excited  I ??? the days ??? with all of my ??? (part no legible) and accessories. I was pumped of ??? my mom and my brother pack the morning at the ??? my dad and I were all set. We packed everything in our old,??? can @NUM1 we headed off. An hour in I ask my dad when are we going to be their? not until ??? (part not legible) my dad said for I slept. My brother was ??? stupid and rider ??? me in his ??? while I was sleeping. We stoped ??? him at a got station because my mom has to ???(part no legible) in and I start ??? (part not legible) was exited. It was about @NUM2. @NUM3 I had to wait to get to a hotel. I was still ??? because ??? wher in mid @LOCATION1 and ??? get to ??? and have an awesome time together. That was my story about the time I had to be patient.	10	8	18
19328	7	I was so bored I was so bored but I know it would pay iof. I was on a flit to??? and it took/heavers. In that I hoven I went to the bathroom, eat lunch, plaed with my more sellfon, I sleped and then soller then I @CAPS1?? it we when there so ??? ??? ???.	6	6	12
19335	7	I have patient until @DATE1 vacation comes along. I try to do my best in school until @DATE1 arrives. @CAPS1 example, last year I was on the honor toll @NUM1 times. Over the @DATE1, if I have to do back regards or a @DATE1  patient, then I will do it and I wont leave it @CAPS1 the last minute. Then, Ill wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. Ill also wait until @DATE1 again. But in between we have some breaks and days off, I think we yet have enough assignments throughout the years, start we go school @NUM2 days a week. School can be really fun sometimes, @CAPS1 example, I wait until field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so principal doesnt take our privellages away, @CAPS1 example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, shell take it away from us. That means all of my patience will be @CAPS1 nothing. That really wouldnt be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing the trouble.	6	8	14
19350	7	One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were writing in line to put school supplies. We were number @NUM1 and they just called @NUM2. It was around @PERCENT1 out and we had to stand there. It was so long the new battery I had just put in my @NUM3 went dead. It took areand @NUM4 hours just to get inside. Then there were even more lines! We barly got our things that day, but because we were patient, we did.	8	8	16
19357	7	Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boreing . There were a lot of people in line that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didnt because that would berude. I felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more. Plus I would not want people cutting in flont of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait.	8	8	16
19373	7	I think patience is like somebody or someone is waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom then the other person can go to the bathroom. Like I am not in patience because I want to go a store now but they said wait your patience. My whole family is not in patience but my friends are.	3	3	6
19378	7	"Patience. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS4 stomach rumbled."" @CAPS2 I'm hungry"" I cried so @CAPS12 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2, because @CAPS8 were on our way home. Moments later @CAPS8 finally pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2's drive through. The cashier said ""hi @MONTH1 I take your @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 yelled ""@CAPS5 I get a famous bowl and a @NUM1 piece honey @CAPS6 wings."" The ladie @CAPS7 ""@MONEY2 @NUM2 first window."" @CAPS8 drove around to the first window @CAPS4 @CAPS2 save the ladie a @MONEY1 bill, @CAPS12 gave her @MONEY3 and said ""@MONEY3 is your change, go to the second window."" @CAPS9 @CAPS8 could drive to the second window @CAPS8 had to wait on the car ahead of us. @CAPS8 sat there for @MONEY1 minutes and they finally left. Then, @CAPS8 drove to the second window and waited. @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 still was waiting. So after @MONEY1 minutes. I said"" @CAPS2 @CAPS5 @CAPS8 go get some @ORGANIZATION1"" @CAPS12 calmly @CAPS7 ""@CAPS10, @CAPS8 are going to sit here patiencely."" I mumerred ""but I m starving."" @CAPS8 sat there and waited patientley for over a hour. I ask one more time ""@CAPS5 @CAPS8 leave please."" @CAPS12 said ""@CAPS10, I payed for the food and I'm going to get it."" @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 finally got the food after two hours. After sitting there @CAPS8 got some free food. Even though @CAPS8 got some free food I well still mad that @CAPS8 sat there all that time."	11	10	21
19386	7	I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!	10	12	22
19394	7	Onece, when my family went to @LOCATION1, we all had to be patient. There is a water ride where you get in a log then you sit and it takes you up a hill. You wait until you get to the top, then you splash down a hill. Well, that was one of everyones favorite rides, so there was a long line. We had to wait for a half hour to ride it once. So, in order to do something, it takes time so you must be patient. If your not patient you probably want get to do what you wanted to do.	8	8	16
19431	7	Where here at cedar point. I was so excited I felt like I was going to go cyco can we go on the dragster first. @CAPS1 why not it`ll be fun when we got in line. It was a estimate of and hour wait. @CAPS2 do you still want to ride the ride, sure I do, so I knew I would have to be patient before I could ride. While we waited, it was hot and when I when @NUM1 went by it felt like and hour !but I knew when it was time patience would pay of. When @NUM2 minutes pasted the dragster was in sight n cling cling we were second in line. Zoom! a carx went by, pimaly a blue long dragster car stoped  and it had my name all over it I got in and in was so patience it was like @NUM3 minutes before the ride started, @NUM4: @CAPS3. At @NUM5 we went up the hill and was like a meteorite crashing down into earth. When it was over my patience payed off and @CAPS4 always patient because of the cedar point dragster.	10	10	20
19436	7	Patience is useful in certain times like waiting for a blood test or to me your ??? again. In other times patience is usless as in the army, any army, you sometimes wait to die by the hand of your enemy .Patience is mostly good because if you rush you might hurt someone, miss something helpful, or just something you enjoy.	3	3	6
19439	7	A time when I was patient: I'm patient when my family, or friends, or teachers are talking. I don't interapt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite, I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink, or getting your lunch, or going in a single file line for a firedrill.  You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done you can help them out and that would be really nice and patient. These are the things I do to be patient.	5	7	12
19455	7	There are many times I was patient, but this one was not to long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the meap. I just sat there finished, just read and drawed. It was absolutely boring, lame, and seconds felt like hours. It was terrible, but I didnt complain I just sat there and did nothing. And that was probably worst time when I want to talk but couldnt.	6	7	13
19466	7	When it was @DATE1 @CAPS1 and I could not wait for @DATE1 so I open my gifts. My mom and dad give my sister and my second sister and me us. give us money so we can go buy thing that we like. My dad mom and dad and my mom and my mom dad and mom give us money. like my mom and dad dose, and I rember I buy a cute cuformin boots and I could wait to open the boots on @DATE1 and I was @CAPS2 up and down and asking can we open one gife it is @DATE1 @CAPS1 and my mom and dad said no and I got mad. So the next day I wake up on @DATE1 and it was above @NUM1 in the moning and I look in the living room and no one was up so I have to wait until when my patent wake up and I could wait and the time takes forever and that was a tim that I could not wait.	7	8	15
19469	7	One time I was patient was at my dad house. Our power had just went out so we figured wait up to two minutes just like it always happened. after a couple days we didnt have power I was ill patient. On day three we called people and figured out ???ahead our power lines they fixed it and we got our power back.	7	6	13
19482	7	Patience is an important thing to have. If helps you and other respect yourself. If you are not patient things will only get worse. My cousin is a big @PERSON1 fan. She wanted tickets to his concert, but when the sold out online she didnt know anywhere else to get them. She didnt know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that the were giving away tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be first in line. Well so did everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket both. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and did not complain. Later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1s face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result. Maybe if my cousin would had been so patient she would have gotten the tickets. Patients will get you @NUM2 long way, especially if it trying to gain respect. My cousin has inspired me to be @NUM2 patient person, and maybe I will get concert tickets someday.	9	10	19
19490	7	 @CAPS1 day I was patient at a water park & I was get @CAPS1 a water slide.,but thier were like @NUM1 people in front of me. At the same time, I it hot then I dont know what, I the ground his hot if you have no flip flops. But, I really want to get @CAPS1 this water slide no matter what. So I stand thier patiently to get @CAPS1 the water slide. Then I said to my self this better be wroth if or im going to be ferious. But it @CAPS2 I gonna be pantient about it. I hope I have fun @CAPS1 this ride.	5	8	13
19496	7	@CAPS1  @CAPS1 @CAPS1!! @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 while running down the stairs. @CAPS4 have to get this cool new book! It looks really really good. Please, please, please! @CAPS4 have to do errands before @CAPS4 go. replied @ORGANIZATION1s @CAPS1. @CAPS6 you are patient @CAPS4 can get the book. persuades her @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 who wants the book bad replied ok and they went to do errands. First stop they went to the gas station then post office, then to the car wash, then finally to the grocery store. At the grocery store @ORGANIZATION1 helps her @CAPS1 shop. All day @ORGANIZATION1 was patient and didnt complain once. The last item on the list is pasta for dinner, @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1s @CAPS1. @CAPS7 I cant seem to find it. Ill go find it. @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1 who was eager to get her book. @ORGANIZATION1 looks down every aisle until she finally finds the pasta her @CAPS1 wants. When @ORGANIZATION1 finally finds her @CAPS1 she is in the checkout. When the cashier is done ringing all the items, @ORGANIZATION1 and her @CAPS1 go to their car and unload. When they get to their house @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about the book until her @CAPS1 came over to her and gave it ot her. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 her thank yous and then realized it isnt hard to be patient.	8	8	16
19498	7	Patience, its something that my family doesnt have. Here is the story. Wile am doing the dishes my little brother is crying cause my little sister @PERSON2 hit him. So sence @CAPS1 is crying (my little brother). @CAPS3 starts to cry (my little sister). So then my step dad is playing on his iphone. He is going to yell at @CAPS1 pretty soon. And what do you know he does. Okay you think its going to get better? Nope wrong. I get @CAPS3 to stop crying. But @CAPS1 just wont so l call @PERSON2 in here and @CAPS1 got to hit her then my step dad starts to go crazy cause he is still crying now @PERSON2 is being a brat stomping of the stairs. When ??? got ??? calm down. Now just as l am about to go crazy @PERSON1 (my older brother) comes in and takes  @CAPS1 down stairs to calm him down. Thank @CAPS7, for @ORGANIZATION1. Then I calm @CAPS3 back down. What a day well l guess my family does have patience well not my step dad.	8	8	16
19508	7	The time I was patient was last @DATE1 when we went to the cedar point. When we went to cedar point there was a long line when we got to the front of the line the machine broke. @CAPS1 we had to go to a nother ride and I couldnt wait @CAPS1 long because I had to go to the bathroom @CAPS1 I walked out of line and went to the bathroom. When I came back there were more people in line @CAPS1 I just waited.	8	4	12
19509	7	My dad @PERSON1 is patient everyday.He goes to work and cant want to come home, but he doesnt go crazy  like me cause I wanna leave. No ,he does his work and waits till @NUM1 when he can leave and go home. He always patiently waits till @NUM1. My dad always been a patient person andto look  up to him because of that patience .	6	5	11
19535	7	I was patient once when my dad had said he was going to give me a letter every @DATE1 because he was to far away for me to visite he lives all the way in @LOCATION1. He told me I had to be patient because Im not really the patient tipe.I guess being patient is not all that hard. For me to be patient I have to being doing something so I get myself to rest by writing stars and drawing, reading, going to any around mother house to help with our animals. And when he finally comes I didnt even get it. Milk @DATE2 so I had to wait even longer within I guess on sit that was to do you just have to have mind on the thing you have to be patient about it.	8	8	16
19538	7	The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball shell just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited. My sister ended up getting so bored she just droped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, then when I was playing basketball again she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames.	6	8	14
19539	7	When I had to go get my check up with my asma or and a familiar way like that when I had been waiting in the waiting room wich had tons of stuff to do if the doctor didnt call your name yet. So I had gotton myself busy with crossword puzzles and looking at the fishes wich were awesome cause they had different kinds of fish. And then mostly I had read my book cause I am a reader at the same time a writer but I mostly I had read my book when the doctor came in finally to call my name but I was still busy doing activities then he had said he was sorry a bout  the wait which took a while and just said it had been fine and he seen all of the stuff I had been doing while I was waiting. And he said I was a very patient nice girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so I can get good compliment which makes me fell really good with a smile on the face. And ever since I see that exact doctor who I had do appointment with he always give me a treat or sitters. But to me it doesnt matter as long as I am treating other people fair usually great. Because people would love to be like you one day for having patience.	8	6	14
19543	7	Will I was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that farthers day morning in @DATE1 I was so exicted. Im not a very patient person so when it came to this it was so hard to sit still. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard but when she was in my arms it was the must ama-zing feeling in my life. its always hard having to leave her when shes calling your name its like I want to cry. I dont always get to come home to a little girl saying my name but I love every minute I do. I always patiently wait to see her again but it is hard if you know what I mean.	8	8	16
19553	7	One early @TIME1 in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 for a @ORGANIZATION1 skating competition I completed. I was waiting to hear if I made it to the @DATE1 part of the event. I had completed in. it was seven in the @TIME1 when we left the rink. We went get a bite to eat and went back to the rink when we were finished. My best friend @PERSON1 also was in the same event I competed in. I knew she would make it to the @DATE1, but I didnt know if I would or not. After a endless wait they were about to call out the people who made it. I kept saying over and over again in my head my number I was given.  They called @PERSON1s number. I was waiting for my number to still be called, but they never called it. I had not made it. I was disapointed, but I couldnt do anything about it.	10	9	19
19557	7	"Awhile back my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called ""@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2"". I had just taken a great sniping position. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, @CAPS3 usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aim my weapon and fired, @CAPS4 to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, @CAPS3 I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1 @CAPS6 I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my weapon from the ground the person was gone. This made me pretty made seens how I waited @CAPS3 long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was looking my patience and getting frustrated. ""@CAPS7 anyone even out here?"" I whispered ""@CAPS8! I got you @CAPS9!"" someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He   was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. This whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one."	12	12	24
20719	8	" ""LAUGHTER""  @CAPS1 I hang out with my friends, the one thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh about is running into trash cans, laundry or maybe even about what we ate for dinner the @TIME1 before. @CAPS1 I am usual stressed out the one thing I love is to hangout with my friends. they usual are good listeners. overall. Though they take your mind off things. So with my friends you can count on having a great time no matter what the occasion is.    @CAPS1 I say trash can I really mean trash cans I remember this one time in the hall way at school my friend was hanging on to my back pack because she tends to loose me in the hall way a lot because I walk a lot faster then her, anyways the class bell had just rouge an all the student were heading to lunch we were. I was just getting ready to cross the hall way an she said don't do it, so I did an nobody stopped! so she kinda slide into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hall way, she @MONTH1 have knocked it off but I can't really say? I was still walking an the sound effects were so funny I laugh at it still.       My friend an I have a inside joke? we went out to lunch together. @CAPS1 we saw a laundry mate an I minds went crazy, we made up a funny joke an said that we should make our self's aprons with lots color and rhinestones, so that way if we wanted to get all of our laundry done at the same time. We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS1 our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.  Now about the food its sort of like the laundry but I guess better? I remember @CAPS1 i came to school the next day i just started talking about what i had for dinner @TIME1 i think at that time my mom had asked us if we wanted chicken @PERSON1 an my sister as i screamed an said hell yeah? so dinner was ready an @CAPS1 we went to go site at the table we looked at it an it was not what we expected it to be? it was frozen out of a box an it looked like somebody had eaten the food than puked it back up? it was that great looking.    All of these thing that have named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @CAPS1 there not drama i love my friend I don't think I could have asked for a better one because all we do is laugh an have fun an fun in to trash can locker an whatever else there is but the one thing that matter the most with my one friend is that @CAPS1 we get in to a fight we can not stay mad at each other well I now that I can't. So at the end of the day I ask her are we done being made at each other? an than we just look at each other an laugh because that about all we can do because the reason was so stupid there was really no need for it.that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us. but just to have fun an be silly. not anybody else but are self's an sometime @CAPS1 we have are really goofy days? we make up the story about our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than to laugh because deep down inside you an your friend will look back an say wow those where the best day was @CAPS1-would would get in trouble in class for talking way to much.

20725	8	 I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness.	21	20	41
20728	8	" Starting a story out with two @NUM1 @DATE1 old boys named @ORGANIZATION1 can already be considered a comedy. Those are the names of my identical twin cousins @ORGANIZATION1 I can honestly admit that they are @NUM2 of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the most intelligent human on earth, @ORGANIZATION1 by the way he named his children it's apparent that his sense of humor is a little bit off, but he's a really hard working man. Occasionally my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be a handful. Weekends are specifically better to have them over because of my hateful step siblings whom hate me, my brother, my sister, @ORGANIZATION1 even my mom. The amount of tension in the house isn't a healthy amount, so a couple of @NUM1 @DATE1 old running around livens it up a little @ORGANIZATION1 makes us all laugh together as a family. It must have been @DATE1 in @DATE2 when @CAPS7 was home @ORGANIZATION1 we were building onto our house when the twins came over. My mom was getting quite furious at their insanely high energy levels, she appeared to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My step dad @PERSON1 needed to go to @PERSON2's for nails @ORGANIZATION1 child locks @ORGANIZATION1 I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would have been a great idea to take the twins with us, just to relieve my mom of the loud mouths for a few minutes. We loaded up the car @ORGANIZATION1 I drove down the highway, amused with the twins in the back seat playing with the ponies @ORGANIZATION1 laughing at the people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like twinkle twinkle little star, @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION2's until we arrived in the @PERSON2's parking lot. @ORGANIZATION1 finds it pretty hilarious to run down the isles @ORGANIZATION1 hide behind items on the lower shelves, while @ORGANIZATION1 enjoys pretending he's @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 getting @CAPS7 confused. Eventually the twins were being too obnoxious, resulting in @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 me catching them @ORGANIZATION1 holding them as captives in the seat-belts of the @PERSON2's cart. It was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued along on our adventure in search of the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 found them down isle @NUM4. There was a large man standing in front of our destination @ORGANIZATION1 when i say large I don't mean muscular, or tall... I mean he probably has a few too many @CAPS1 shows he watches daily, @ORGANIZATION1 maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long @ORGANIZATION1 sandy blond, he wore a dark purple @CAPS2 die shirt @ORGANIZATION1 slip on sandals. @ORGANIZATION1 apparently hadn't realized how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude fashion, especially when they can hear you. He said, ""@CAPS3 cow @ORGANIZATION1 look at that lady! She's so huge!"" @ORGANIZATION1 laughed outrageously @ORGANIZATION1 agreed. ""@CAPS4! She's as big as our whole car!"" I panicked a bit @ORGANIZATION1 tried to get them to be quiet, however the twins paid @CAPS5 attention to me, they were much more excited to see the man on the tall ladder next to me giggling @ORGANIZATION1 laughing along with them. They were quiet for a moment then @ORGANIZATION1 gasped @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed, "" @CAPS5 she's as big as a fire truck!"" The man turned around @ORGANIZATION1 glared at me; i apologized at least @NUM5 times @ORGANIZATION1 started to take the boys out of the isle when the man on the ladder hit a button to make the ladder move. I was walking behind the larger man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beeping sound, like that of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear @ORGANIZATION1 shouted frantically, ""@CAPS6 run as fast as you can hurry! She's backing up @ORGANIZATION1 she's going to squish you on the floor!"" @CAPS7 laughed, even the man they were making fun of, but i was so embarrassed that i just took them to the car @ORGANIZATION1 waited for @PERSON1. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to a word i said. @PERSON1 only took approximately @NUM6 more minutes before he came jogging out the door with the nails, the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store @ORGANIZATION1 i chuckled quietly until @PERSON1 hopped into the truck, then i started laughing profusely. When I returned home I told my mom what had happened, she laughed for a while @ORGANIZATION1 i laughed even harder @ORGANIZATION1 quite a bit longer than i had before. I went to sleep with a fairly massive headache that night, but i think it was worth laughing all day for."	23	16	44
20733	8	" People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes a you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"".  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, ""@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""@CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time"". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh. That's @CAPS2 makes our family relationship stick together, and other familys also.I finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship."	18	18	36
20736	8	"               ""Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but @CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping @CAPS2 full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh @CAPS2 off with time and start new. @CAPS5 helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried @CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever @CAPS5 would joke around with me I would take @CAPS2 all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought @CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that @CAPS2 was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. @CAPS5 said, ""@PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. @CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, ""@PERSON1? Are you alright, @CAPS2's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" @CAPS5 exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes @CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, @CAPS5 looked worried. @CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that @CAPS5 so desperately wanted to have with me. @CAPS5 told me about how they would @CAPS3 together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then @CAPS3. ""@CAPS3? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned.  @CAPS5 replied, "" @CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" @CAPS5 helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can @CAPS3 off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" "	20	25	45
20746	8	" In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter."	17	16	33
20747	8	" These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody."	18	20	38
20754	8	Making someone laugh is the best feeling to their soul, and it is one step closer to internal happiness. People might say that when feeling something good inside the body its when they know that they have done something right. I agree with this because it has happen to me; I was feeling down about something that I cant even remember but, when I felt the need to help someone do something I knew inside of me that I did something very special at that moment. It's amazing how you make someone laugh, and it doesn't matter where you are, you also feel happy. The one person in my life that has a great sense of humor is my mother. She is always in need of something funny.People enjoy laughing so much that it is if they were to take some sort of energy drink to make them not want to stop laughing. I hear people say that laughter is very healthy for a human soul, and it will also make the soul and body last longer. Laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much. It could be a great way to start a conversation with a person. Positive thinking leads to making good choices especially if happiness leads you on in life. By making someone laugh it makes the awkwardness go away. It is better to laugh then to be sad.Everyone has their addiction to something in which they need to depend on. My mom's addiction is laughing. She laughs at work and she especially laughs at the house whenever I'm around. Although, sometimes she feels down whenever something goes wrong. I hate seeing her like this, because it then makes me feel down. When she is feeling sad it is if there is nothing in the world that would make her cheer up. If one person is feeling depress, that feeling passes on to the next person closest to them. Eventually I get tiered of seeing my mom like this and in this situation I cant help it but to get up and start doing some ridiculous stuff to cheer her up. Some things that pop into my mind is that I can start dancing funny or tell a little lie that might of happen at school that I think will cheer her up. When there is an opportunity to make someone laugh I enjoy to put a smile on their face.My mom means the world to me just as I mean the world to her. We try to help each other in any way as possible. This one day she came home from work and my dad was sitting in the table reading the newspaper and my mom walks in, and notices that my dad hasn't made food yet she started to flip out on him. She thought that it was stupid of him to not make dinner for us. She was pretty angry at him for a period of time, so she started to make us dinner but she was doing it all wrong. She was mixing the spices in the wrong pan, I was going to let her know that she was doing it all wrong, but my dad was holding me back so that I wouldn't get her more angry. She finally finish cooking and served us our plates but we didn't wanted to eat it because she made the food out of anger and made it smell funky. My dad forced us to eat it because he thought that by eating the food it would make her happy, but he was wrong it only made her feel worse because my youngest brother didn't like it. I felt bad so I had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood to not be mad at my dad anymore. I turn on the @CAPS1 and changed the @CAPS2 to the music @CAPS2 and started to dance as if I were to have ants in my pants. Her lungs were about to burst because she was laughing so hard, and eventually she was in a good mood for the rest of the day.Everywhere I go I see people smiling and laughing about something and it only makes me wonder about the funny things that are being said. I think that it is a good thing for someone to feel good about themselves because it brings a positive feeling in the room. I enjoy to see people be happy because it always makes me feel happy. What better way to be happy when smiling is one step closer to laughing. My mom and I like to take walks just so that we wouldn't feel apart and stay closer to each other, we see different people each time we go walking and we always get a smile from them. That is the best feeling in the world, to feel joy is to be free from all your problems.	16	15	31
20762	8	" Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM1 grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS2 and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?"	15	17	32
20768	8	"                          Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5, we've got something to tell @CAPS3."" I knew @CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that @CAPS8 they went into the other room, @CAPS6 wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce @CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells @CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @CAPS3 could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS9 was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet @CAPS11 become one, @CAPS6 had turned red @CAPS11 irritated. @CAPS6 killed me inside to see her crying, @CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love @CAPS11 that @CAPS6 all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment @CAPS11 anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around @CAPS9 was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,""@CAPS6's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father @CAPS11 I."" @CAPS7 did they think those statements made @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION1. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. @CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. @CAPS6 was broken @CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just @CAPS8 @CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I @CAPS1 never forget. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time @CAPS8 mom @CAPS11 I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS11 familiar. @CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives @CAPS11 mine.  I began to laugh, @CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,""@CAPS9's wrong, @CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That @CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, @CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, @CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS1 be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If @CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4."	20	25	45
20781	8	" The laughter in me.  To me all you need to do to get through a tough and horrible day is a good @CAPS5. It gives you hope throughout the day, and no matter what kind of mood your in, when leaving to work, going to school, or really any activity that involves a ""sigh"" moment. For me I get that feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @PERSON1. Everyday she manages to say something totally off topic and we'd end up dying of laughter at the top of the stairs near the science labs were we eat lunch. As people walk by they give us weird looks, we don't care because we understand each other. To me @CAPS9 is my way of reliving stress.My @CAPS1 agrees with me her name is @CAPS2 I call her @ORGANIZATION1. We've been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working at some fast food restaurant. I hang out a lot at her at her house and we share so many great and fun memories. Its really bad when we are around each other, its like one look at each other and boom!, I'm on the floor not breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is but, its like when we see each other its a rush off all the good times we've spent coming together all at once. Sometimes we @CAPS5 hysterically over nothing. I doesn't make sense but I guess that doesn't matter when your hanging with your best bud.  Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. Its shows me how fun a person can be and if the have a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and not some stuck up want to be perfect robot. All @PERSON1 and I talk about is boys and boy problems and it makes me @CAPS5 and giggle, but when we are in our fifth period class forestry and fire we are like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we are magically ""high,"" all of a sudden have this out burst of energy. We sit next to sit side by side to one another and we tickle each other and @CAPS5 really loud. By the end of class I make a paper ball and we play paper soccer ball its fun especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop and you don't do it. Lets just say that her face turns a very bright red color.Nothing compares to how much I @CAPS5 when I'm with @ORGANIZATION1. When I used to go to @CAPS3 I had three classes with her @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4. We also had lunch together, but anyway as I was saying, I swear we had a not stop @CAPS9 war everyday. My @CAPS5 is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like, some thinks its cute, others think I @CAPS5 funny( The weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2 she'd stand next to me and she'd look at me weird, or said something that didn't come out right, or sang obnoxiously, anything she did cracked me up it was so distracted when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from @CAPS9 with her. At home when my family is all together, are way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It's different than laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS6 was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mothers stomach. We made fun of my brother for being the only boy out of five kids. We make fun of my sister @PERSON2 for being the shortest one in our family. I can feel the difference between laughter. It's mostly criticism really.I @CAPS5 mostly because I feel more alive it gives me something to live for everyday in stead of ""@CAPS7 great, another day to try to get through, @CAPS8...no."" @CAPS9 for me gets me motivated for the day it's like my drug to get through life. It gives me an easy way in to communicate with others. I thank @CAPS10 for giving us the ability to @CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. ""That's how I make friends I @CAPS5.""  "	15	20	40
20802	8	"My relationship with laughter.  Well the first time I came face to face with laughter was when I met my boyfriend for the first time. Before I met him I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't stand it anymore. But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time. When that happened for the first time in almost a year I smiled I didn't smile until the day I met him. That's when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who I am.  Later in the relationship is where laughter came into play I was laughing all the time when I was around him and not upset all the time. That's when we started hanging out but, it took all of our friends to us to hang out. After we stated to hang out we got to know each other better then we did for the beginning when we first met. It took until freshmen year for us to start dating. That is when I found out I suppose ably dating someone else and not him I didn't believe it at first until that guy came up to me and started yelling.   He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said ""@CAPS1 are @CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over?"" with a guy @CAPS3 just met. Then he tried telling me it was over and I told him ""We were never dating in the first place!"". My friends walked up to me and saw me in tears and asked me whats wrong and tried to find me someone new. By the time @CAPS4 did I was with another guy and I'm happy with him and nothing can change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when I'm upset or mad he says ""don't worry everything will be okay I promise so just believe in me.""  Laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now so we don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again we have messed up so many time that we don't know what to do anymore. If it leaves now I don't know what I'm going to do it's apart of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together with out messing up this time around. This part of my relationship is the best and it wont change at least I hope that it wont because it would make me go back to living in fear of my step dad I'm glade that I found someone. I hope that it doesn't change because laughter is what comes with him and when I'm around him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when I was crying not even my friends and family. Now that laughter is here almost all the time I can't wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window. So now that me and him are together and happy and hopefully nothing goes bad between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not my bubbly self when he's not around. Six to @CAPS2 of my friends say "" @CAPS3 are losing your bubbly self don't let her disappear on @CAPS3 she is there to guide @CAPS3 down the road."" @CAPS4 also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason @CAPS1 I don't is because @CAPS4 can be bossy and @CAPS4 tell me what I can and can't do. @CAPS1 can't people just understand that this relationship isn't going to work if @CAPS4 keep getting in the middle of it @CAPS4 all think that my life revolves around them and it doesn't. My relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family it has to do with my boyfriend and me and that's @CAPS1 I told @CAPS3 about my relationship with laughter. Lets just say my relationship with laughter will always be here and nothing will change it not even my parents or his parents we can promise @CAPS3 that much. @CAPS1 can't this relationship just have a happy ending to it with out anyone or anything trying to get in the middle of it? I just wish that there was a world @CAPS3 could just run away to with out anyone knowing where it's at in the world. Well just to say nothing can make this relationship ever go bad unless we start to fight again with each other I hope that nothing will tear us apart and if it does who knows what will happen."	15	15	30
20823	8	" Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language."""	21	20	41
20825	8	 In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for what ever reason it @MONTH1 be. those are the @NUM3 thing i think you need to have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i will never be able to lose it no matter how hard i try to i now she will always be by my side.	15	18	33
20832	8	" Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @CAPS7 fall @CAPS3 their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how @CAPS7 fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life that their isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and @CAPS7 always make me laugh. Their isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1 and sat down @CAPS3 a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3."" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS3, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS3 the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION2"", with two guys wearing black @CAPS3 each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS8""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS9""! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness."	20	18	36
20847	8	 Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time.	15	20	35
20848	8	" Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS1 moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS1 I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS1 it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS1 getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile."	15	15	30
20860	8	                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear.	20	18	36
20887	8	It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON2 who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it.	15	17	32
20893	8	" Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you @MONTH1 be one person who can be ""stuck up"" or a funny person who can really be ""stuck up"", but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are. When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. ""@CAPS1 are blue, roses are red, your always in my head, i want you in my bed...."" That's suppose to be a love poem. When your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend that went with me to the party her name is @PERSON1. It was gettting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything this was probably around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. See us for some reason do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just didn't want the night to end at all.  We al sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching ""@CAPS2 A"". Then out of random i started to laugh at @LOCATION1, and till this day I don't know why i was laughing at her. All of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe no more. So I got up walk my self to the bathroom, but i could still hear @CAPS3 laughter in the room which was still making me laugh.  Since that night @PERSON1 and I got a lot closer in our friendship. Laughter is a lot in life. It might make you feel like your dying sometimes, but that feeling is worth it."	17	20	37

Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  ""@CAPS3 @PERSON5,"" I began, ""@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement. ""@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!"" @CAPS6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS17 camera.  We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. @CAPS12 was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS10 the mall?  ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11,"" @CAPS12 screamed. ""@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13, and @CAPS14're @CAPS9? He's never going to talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!""  ""@CAPS14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS14 know it,"" chimed @PERSON2. ""@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14 pretty good, huh?"" ""@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,"" I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up @CAPS9, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS12 was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut @CAPS1 that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS14 have any experiences @CAPS2 laughter brought @CAPS14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?    "	20	20	40
20955	8	 Everyone laughs differently , some people laugh so hard that they cry, and some don't. But one thing that they have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy, or happiness, or even if something is just really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something for instance maybe you are having a bad day and then one of your friends comes up to you and tells you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, right? Having a good sense of humor is something that can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, or even like I said just a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and even something that you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing, it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it. Whenever I laugh I always feel better, laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of good times I have spent with friends and family, it reminds me of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years and that we can still laugh at just as hard as we used to. I believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger. When you laugh at things it creates long lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about them again in the future you will still think it is just as funny as before. Some of my best friends laugh at everything, they think that every little joke is the funniest ever, their laughs are unforgettable you can always hear them laughing. Which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy. If you believe that you are not a funny person, just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and most likely start laughing as well.  I enjoy getting to spend quality time with some of my closest friends, and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for the beginning of @DATE1 before going into high school. It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from middle school. We packed up my family's car and headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. Not even half-an-hour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on. We always create great memories and this one was already in the books for one of the best. I am sure that the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun, we sang songs and danced (as much as we could buckled down in a seat) to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours. Of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny. We made a boring moment fun. Once we finally got there we did not hesitate to drop off our bags and grab our bikes and take off and explore. The weather was so nice, not a cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school. The next day we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft, sounds like a fun idea. Well it would be if we actually knew where we were going, I used to do it all the time with my family so I had an idea of where to go, but still five girls two rafts and a river, maybe not such a good idea. During the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars. Knowing us we laughed the whole way down the river. Whenever we passed people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us by how much we were laughing and enjoying each others company. By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry good thing my mom had prepared us some lunch for when we got home, when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh. You know you have built a good friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other. All because of one little thing called laughter.                                     	18	22	40
20963	8	"                 Laughter at its @CAPS1  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS1 they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH1 actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON1 and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often."	20	20	40
20988	8	"  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless! "	20	18	36

21020	8	 The only true story that I can remember that involves laughter was about @NUM1 years ago at the beach. I was with my mom and my sister @LOCATION1. I was running from incoming waves when I decided to run into just one wave which that wave sweep me off my feet and spun me around for what seemed like forever, but wasn't even @NUM2 seconds. I laughed so hard that I tripped and i started spinning again, my mom had to get me up because I could not stop. I got so many cuts from the sand that it was hilarious. after I got changed I got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it. That's the only time I remember laughter being my true friend.	18	15	33
21033	8	                            Whats Laughter!How many friends do you really have? What relationships do you have with others? Well, I'm in high school and I usually don't have that many friends. But I have a few and one of my friends @CAPS4 friends with someone that I truly love. (@CAPS1 didn't know that) @CAPS2 year I was a freshmen and i went to the church with some of my friends and their was an @NUM1 grader that fell in the pond/water and I wasn't sure @CAPS20 @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 or not so I end up coming up to him and asked.Me; @CAPS4 you @CAPS3?, do you need some help?@CAPS1 said; @CAPS6, its @CAPS3 I just sprained my ankle.Me; @CAPS3, see you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS9 sure, @CAPS6 problem! The next year when I'm a sophomore I didn't realized that @CAPS1 was going to be their as a freshmen! his name is @CAPS11 I was starting to hang out with him more because @CAPS1 was really funny and sweet.  We went to the @CAPS12 ball together and our other friends were their but i was worried about of some stuffs but @CAPS1 made it butter because at that time i was afraid that my ex was their. @CAPS11 was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and their was a song that was on and I didn't realized that i was dancing until @CAPS1 told me that I was so after was dancing with him I end up asking him @CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends and @CAPS1 said a was able too so me and @PERSON1 ends up dancing and @CAPS1 was their when I needed him. We end up heading outside and I called @CAPS13 @CAPS14 to be picked up. So, in the mean time, we were outside waiting for her. We were laughing at some jokes that we @CAPS15 said to each other. Like one was that @CAPS1 @CAPS15 some thing in his @CAPS15 and acted like that it was a wand of some sort to the school building and @CAPS15 asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I end up sneaking up behind him and scared him so bad that I end up laughing and @CAPS1 was too. Because @CAPS1 usually doesn't get freaked out like that, and @CAPS1 told me that @CAPS1 is going to get me back and I'm starting to freak out from me not knowing what it @MONTH1 be. @CAPS11 is a great help when i need him!  The thing about laughter in life is that you would need eat ether way your upset or not in the mood.The main thing that was funny from my family is that we prank each other; like my sister would step out of the room and her soda is in the room that I'm in she still @CAPS15 about half of soda in the can their was mustard on the table and she hates mustard form the taste of it but my dad was thinking the same thing that I was wanting to do and that was to put a little bit of mustard in her soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at me also my @CAPS17. My sister ends up having some of the soda and she was looking at my @CAPS14 and was like;@CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS14 and myself was laughing and she hates mustard!, @CAPS20 it was something that I didn't like and that was put in my soda I would've done this too. So, mostly I'm trying to say is that their is some laughter that is funny. not all laughter is not funny. Its butter @CAPS20 you don't prank people that is close to your heart because they @MONTH1 get mad at you. Like my sister, @PERSON2 was mad at me when it wasn't me it was my dad's idea.	12	15	27
21044	8	" I believe laughter brings many different people together. In my friendships with friends we are always laughing about random, silly, things that happen to us each day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. One time when laughter help me out the most was the during fourth grade. Fourth grade had brought so many ups and downs with it which none of us knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fight over the littlest reason. This fight included my best friend @PERSON2, also my neighbor, @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We all were very close until this fight which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Everyone had their sides, @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2 and I was all alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't side with anyone they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @DATE2 and I because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew that and could not believe we had a huge fight. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 would try as hard as possible to hang out with both of us but somehow it didn't seem like that to @LOCATION1 and I. We both thought that @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 were never hanging out with us.  Soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember every other day someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would being going to see a councilor. @PERSON3 on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON1 remembers it ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 or I remember talking but I guess change had start to come. When we went to the councler she was very nice and talked to us in a way we all felt comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing. We said that we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during the times we used to spend together, we answered yes. She let us play games, such as monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along. After school I went home and my mom asked me how the councling session had gone. I smiled and said we all had a blast! The next day the three of us went back to the councler and played more games. This session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, all of us read the paper to one another. All having the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future.  To most extent this message was very true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we simply say ""don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" In most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs and along with those comes laughter or crying. In the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends. They are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key."	20	18	36
21054	8	"Laughter is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS6 frustrating when you can't manage to get someone to laugh? Is @CAPS6 really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile? There's something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes @CAPS6 just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what @CAPS6 is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay. Last @DATE1, I was babysitting, @CAPS6 was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION1. At the time I could not legally drive anybody outside of my family, so we decided to call my sister, @LOCATION1. She had the day off work, so @CAPS6 seemed to be a perfect day for frostys. We waited for what seemed like forever for @PERSON2 to get to the house and finally, after about an hour, she pulled in the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded into the back of @CAPS4 car and off we went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there, we started getting out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON2 had just locked the keys in the car, with the keys still in the ignition and the car running! I was still getting the kids out of the car so you'd think that I would just reach in and grab them, but no, that was not the case here. I asked @PERSON2 ""@CAPS3 did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to get your keys?"" @CAPS4 response was, ""@CAPS5, no! I locked @CAPS6 too! Don't close your door!"" @CAPS6 was too late. I instinctively closed the door after i was done. I hadn't really thought about the fact that I could have saved all of this from happening, especially considering that I was the one that noticed @CAPS6 first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after I ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't figure out what was so funny. Then @CAPS6 hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION2's parking lot with three kids, locked outside of a car that was running and we didn't really know what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and have @CAPS4 bring the spare @CAPS1, but we weren't really sure where the spare @CAPS1 was at the time. My mom said that she didn't have @CAPS6 so we would have to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS6 was. We called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid, but then said the @CAPS1 was in his truck and somebody would have to come get @CAPS6 from him because he was about to go into a meeting. Obviously we couldn't go get @CAPS6 from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS6, though at this point she wasn't very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us to not worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @CAPS6 with @CAPS6 locked, and just go inside @PERSON1's and get our frostys. Through all of this @PERSON2 and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy role playing me closing the door while @PERSON2 said not to. They thought @CAPS6 was hilarious. @PERSON2 and I were not so humored by @CAPS6, although we did think @CAPS6 was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again. Instead of us making the kids laugh, they were making us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION2's for almost two hours before my mom showed up with the @CAPS1. @CAPS6 turned out that the @CAPS1 was not in my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS6 was at our house, hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys. That didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mom showed up with us not there. The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day, neither was @PERSON2 blaming me for everything and making me fill @CAPS4 tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting. The funny part was the kids. Still today, they laugh about our little @PERSON1's adventure. @CAPS6 just makes me realize that @CAPS6's all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone. I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day, even if they think @CAPS6's the worst day ever. Laughter really is the @CAPS1."	20	23	43
21070	8	" Laughter. Something everyone does. Its natural, organic, normal. They say children laugh more than adults, maybe that's @CAPS6 keeps them children. They can still let that deep instinct to enjoy themselves be expressed in bursts of happy noise. Laughter is always unique to every person. Some have musical laughs, others have deep belly laughs. Then there @CAPS10 those or snort or snicker, the kind of laugh that makes @CAPS8 laugh because @CAPS8 hear it. Those @CAPS10 my favorite. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I couldn't agree more. Laughing with people has been the greatest influence in my relationships with my friends. I have five girlfriends that I would not be able to live without. They support me, love me, and get me to be bold and get out of my comfort zone. There have been many sleepovers where at two in the morning all @CAPS8 here is the laughter of all of us at some shocking @TIME1 confession or horror at the ""would @CAPS8 rather?"" someone just came up with. One @TIME1 in particular was especially funny. It was last @DATE1 and we were sleeping on @ORGANIZATION1's porch. It was a spectacular @TIME1, the stars were out the air was cool but comfortable and a meteor shower was happening later on that evening. @PERSON3 started the conversation with her favorite catch phrase, ""@CAPS1 guys, hows life?"" We all @CAPS16 because if @CAPS8 @CAPS10 around @PERSON3 for more than and hour @CAPS8 will here this saying a @CAPS2 times.  ""@CAPS3 as five minutes ago,"" I replied.  ""@CAPS4 guys my life has completely changed,"" said @PERSON1 sarcastically. ""@CAPS5 really?"" @LOCATION1 asked, her little body curled up in her sleeping bag, ""@CAPS6 have @CAPS8 had a personality flip, @CAPS11 @CAPS8'@CAPS20 now blond and stupid?""  ""@CAPS7."" @PERSON1 said sarcastically, rolling her eyes, a very @ORGANIZATION1 gesture. We @CAPS16 at the ridiculous mental picture of ""the brain""being stupid.  ""@CAPS8 guys want to play would @CAPS8 rather?"" @ORGANIZATION2 piped in. I had thought she was asleep by now. All I could see was her red hair covering her face. ""@CAPS9!"" yelled @PERSON2, ""I can't handle my mind being filled with horrible mental pictures!"" she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images. ""@CAPS10 @CAPS8 sure? I have some new ones."" @PERSON1 said with her best evil voice, ""@CAPS11 would @CAPS8 rather have to..."" ""@CAPS9!"" we all yelled together and the laughter ensued.  ""@CAPS13 or @CAPS14?"" @PERSON3 suggested. An unintelligible noise came from @ORGANIZATION2's pillow. ""@CAPS6 did @CAPS8 say?"" I asked. She raised her sleepy eyed face. ""I'@CAPS23 too lazy, and unless the @CAPS14 is to be the first one asleep then I'@CAPS23 not playing!"" she dropped her head back onto her pillow.  ""I agree,"" @LOCATION1 added, ""I'@CAPS23 too lazy.""  ""@LOCATION1 it would take @CAPS8 four hours just to get out off this porch cause @CAPS8'@CAPS20 so @CAPS21."" @CAPS16 @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 not @CAPS21. I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!""  ""@CAPS5 just accept it @LOCATION1, @CAPS8'@CAPS20 @CAPS21!"" ""@CAPS9 @PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!""We continued @CAPS11 this, bantering back and forth till slowly people began to fall asleep, drifting off in the cool @TIME1 air. I was the last awake, and as I watched the meteor shower I had a sudden epiphany. My life was pretty awesome right now.  It was @DATE1, @CAPS9 school, @CAPS9 stress. I was laying on a porch watching a meteor shower listening the @TIME1 sounds and feeling perfectly safe, and I had the best five friends I could ever wish for. We joked and @CAPS16 with each other, but this is the first step to being so comfortable with people that @CAPS8 can tell them everything. Laughing with someone breaks the ice, it brings us closer together. Laying there I suddenly realized that because of all of our joking I felt comfortable enough with these girls to tell them just about everything, and I wanted to. I had never felt @CAPS11 this before. That I could do anything because there were five people that had my back through anything. I smiled to myself and as I closed my eyes I imagined all of the laughter I would get to enjoy with these friends."	20	20	40
21075	8	" Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about."	20	15	35
21086	8	"               The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3 started out a few years back when I first met my cousin @ORGANIZATION1. For the first time I spent the night at his house, the day before we were outside all day running around his yard and jumping off their roof. @CAPS3 was all very fun and entertaining but no matter what we did @ORGANIZATION1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. ""this looks like that!"", or ""she sounds like this!"" @CAPS4 his tone of voice and his unique way of shouting @CAPS3, I could not stop laughing. @CAPS3 was unbearable, @CAPS3 made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach would begin to hurt and @ORGANIZATION1 himself would begin laughing from watching me slowly collapse from the uncontrollable laughter.@CAPS3 did not stop there, later that evening we stayed up almost the entire night watching @CAPS1 videos on @CAPS6 and playing @CAPS7 on the @NUM1. The laughter got even greater as we were both becoming extremely tired and our minds were racing all over our thoughts, we laughed until the point where I fell over laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of my cousins imparable mouth made me burst out laughing as if I was hearing the funniest joke for the first time ever.The next morning I had an immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. even then, @ORGANIZATION1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a @CAPS1 subject. The next morning we had breakfast and @CAPS3 was just as fun as the night before. Listening to the nonstop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject and every thought possible. The day continued @CAPS4 the ever-lasting laughter between my cousin and I. Later as I left I though to my self how much more fun I'll have the next time I come to visit. From then on @ORGANIZATION1 and I became best of friends and the times got better and funner. Without laughter, life would be incomplete."	15	15	30
21089	8	 After a long day at the @ORGANIZATION1 mom said it was my turn to decide where we went to dinner that night. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because I love their seafood. We got @CAPS6 legs, popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp. After the food we got two slices of double chocolate lava cake. For some reason it sent us into a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard, we started to cry. We had just finished going clothes shopping at the @ORGANIZATION1 and mom said that I could pick where we went out to eat. My brother started whining about it but mom said it was fair because he got to choose last time. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 which is what my brother said he would have picked anyway. I picked that restaurant for two reasons, first because it was close to the @ORGANIZATION1, and second because I love seafood. Mom didn't have a lot of money so she said we should all share a few things instead for everybody getting their own. We bought two pounds @CAPS5 @CAPS6 legs, and order of popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp (mainly for herself). I'm kind of glad we all shared because it was cheaper and it was just the right amount of food so we didn't have to take home boxes. We never eat leftovers anyway. After our dinner my brother and I begged our mother to buy a dessert. after much thought and convincing she said alright and ordered two slices of the best cake I've ever tasted in my entire life!It was so rich my mom and I could barley finish our slice. My brother gulped his down with ease. After we were done the waiter came by and replaced our plates with the tab.  We all glanced at it and decided not to get dessert again(which never actually happened). Then mom got a bad case of the giggles. Shortly after my brother and i caught the giggles like a disease. Giggles turned into laughter and the laughter became hysterical. We couldn't seem to figure out what was so funny or how it happened. People were starting to stare at us but we still couldn't contain ourselves. Pretty soon our eyes started to water and then there were tears. Tears of joy I'd assume but I new one thing for sure, we had to get out of there. Mom managed to pay the tab just fine, but as soon as she got in the car and herd me and my brother laughing, she started busting up again! She was absolutely convinced it was the cake. she said there is no other reasonable explanation that we would laugh and laugh about nothing. Now I believe that statement because we've tried every other dessert and none of them had the same effect on us. We go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh. I guess its not just the seafood that I like. I rather enjoy the cake too. We call it the double chocolate laugh cake.	16	20	36
21095	8	" Laughter can not only be a benefit to ourselves but to others as well. We only seem to use it whenever you feel the need to become happy, but in reality it shouldn't be the only reason why. Laughter is not only being able to feel better but to let out what you need to let out. Being able to enjoy yourself is pride and you should feel better about yourself. Whenever you laugh, how do you feel? Do you feel like the world is lifted off of your shoulders and you feel better about yourself? I don't mean you have to laugh so loud and so much that you fall off your chair and roll around but a simple chuckle would do the trick. Watch your favorite movie or go have fun with friends, as long as you are laughing you will and should feel better about yourself. That brings us to what happens around @CAPS2 family.  When I was younger I would go on trips with @CAPS2 family up to @LOCATION2. At the time I lived in @LOCATION1. Every @DATE1 we would cram anywhere from five to nine people in a van and be on our way. Having hardly any space of your own you would think it wouldn't be any fun. All in all we would have some fights about where to stop on the way from food or when to turn but nothing too serious. Being younger then everybody I was wildly bored. So to fix the problem I would make @CAPS2 family tell jokes, make funny faces, do something. Right when somebody would let out a joke or made a face, I would crack up laughing. Pure bliss and pure innocent. It didn't mean that they were funny or that they were even trying but to let up the intense shoulders, I would laugh. When we would get to where we were staying on @CAPS2 great grandparents land, we would cram yet another time, in a small area for our sleeping. Everybody would get a cot and would have to endure the warm daylight and the harsh cold bitter @TIME1. The cold nights were the ones that got to all of us the most, because @CAPS2 great grandparents had land meant that the place we were to stay at wasn't filtering heat. Sleeping bag and the clothes on your back were the only thing that we were able to get. So when the sun slipped slowly from shinning its bright light among us, we'd bundle up. Knowing me I did not listen to what @CAPS2 family sad and I would drink tons of water before I rest @CAPS2 head against the cot.  If you have common sense, which when I was younger did not. You would know that if you drink a lot before you go to bed and having the cold surround your body, you would have to use the restroom at some point during the @TIME1. Because @CAPS2 aunt was only @NUM1 years older then me, should would be the one that would have to wake up to walk me outside, down the driveway, to the porter potty, wait for me, then go back to sleep while trying to shake off the shivers that controlled her like the puppet master. Knowing @TIME1, she was not happy with @TIME1 situations, I'm sure nobody would be. The last time she took me, she made sure it was the last time she would get up to take me to the restroom.  The @TIME1 came that she had to take me. We started walking down the driveway. The wind was not like other nights, ripping every which way and piercing through @CAPS2 skin. Another odd thing about @TIME1 was instead of the dull tired face @CAPS2 aunt usually would have, she was awake, more the awake, she seemed to have a slight grin on her face. Since it was pitch dark she had the flash light with her. She opened the door to let me in and shinned the light down in the cracks so I would be able to see more clearly. Once I was done, I felt the shaking of the porter potty and heard in the voice of a monster the ""@CAPS1 y was coming to get me, run, run run!"" @CAPS2 blood rushed all over, warmth is what I remember feeling. Pushing the door open, screaming, running for @CAPS2 ""safety"" is what went through @CAPS2 mind. As I realized @CAPS2 aunt wasn't with me, I looked back. Only to find her laughing uncontrollably at what just happened. The meaning behind @TIME1 would be that you can just turn a bad situation into a good one if you rearrange the problem. You can turn it into a laughing matter instead of a dreaded time. @CAPS2 aunt making me do something she would think was funny would be a better sense for her and relieve her from whatever she thought she felt. Its a cause and effect placement. Causing me to panic effected her to be at more of an ease."	19	16	35
21097	8	"Social @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people think of laughter as a way of showing how you feel, almost like an emotion. I look at laughter in a different way. Laughter is a form of communication. Sure you @MONTH1 laugh when something is funny, but the truth is that you can control it. So @CAPS5 do people laugh? They laugh to convey a message; basically they are letting you know that what you said or did was amusing to them. Overtime, laughter can build relationships, or even start them, all because when someone laughs at you or with you, you are sharing a common ground. I know that laughter is an important thing in my life because, without it, I would have never met my best friend. When I began sixth grade, I was scared. I was scared that I would lose all of my old friends and become one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria every day wishing that he had someone to eat his greasy pizza with. Of course I was overreacting, but the thought was always lingering in my mind all through the first few days. Soon I even began to notice that my friends were actually find new people to hang out with, and I was beginning to feel as though I was becoming that outcast I had feared to be. Then I met him. He was a skater kid with dark hair down past his eyes and white, almost pale, skin. I was with one of my few friends, @CAPS3, when I saw him riding around near the front of the school. I didn't really think much of him besides the fact that he had some of the coolest shoes I had ever seen. I was actually surprised when @CAPS3 walked up and started to talk to him like he had known him forever. I walked with him to avoid the image of being any more of an outcast. As soon as we are standing in front of him, he says something like an insult that I would usually brush off as nothing, but this time for some reason made me really mad. I said things back and before I knew it, we were in verbal warfare. In the end I knew one thing: I hated that kid, and he hated me.  Towards the middle of the year, our school had a dance. It was the first dance I had ever been to and I had butterfly's in my stomach. I got a ride with one of my old friends, @DATE1. I liked @DATE1 because he was never judgmental or anything like that, he was just friendly. When we were in the car driving to the middle school, he told me that he had to pick some else up, which didn't really bother me at all until we got to the house. The house wasn't very impressive it could have been a cardboard box for all I cared. When i saw the the kid's left foot step out of the house I knew exactly who's shoe it was. As he got in to the car, I pretended as if I hadn't seen him. I failed. The whole car ride was nothing but awkward. When we got to the dance I walked on the right side of @DATE1 to avoid confrontation. @DATE1 scenced the tension and stopped walking. What he said next surprised me a little. ""@CAPS5 don't you guys just get along?"" We both stood there, eyes locked, when skater kid made another one of his ""nice comments"". I thought it was going to be the beginning of the year all over again, but I did something I didn't expect to do: I laughed. He laughed too. It was almost as if for the first time ever, we were friends. The whole night we hung out and danced like crazy. We had become friends.  During the rest of the year, we became better and better friends. We went over to eachother's houses and hung out at school. That was when I realized that we were best friends. Even now, in ninth grade we are still best friends. It's crazy how one small giggle can escalate into that, but that's what happened. I don't know how laughter can do that, or @CAPS5 I even laughed that night, but one thing is certain: laughter is important. "	25	21	46
21106	8	Water @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 we think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality it's practically a way of life. We use laughter to cheer people up, or get out of trouble. People do stupid things just to make others laugh. I personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives. I have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better, and I would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up. When I was a child my friend would always be picked on at school, for no reason really. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning and I took @CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and soured milk. When she pointed the girls out to me I grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. I looked at my friends face, she was awe shock, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I was not yet finished. I then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair, her scream was earsplitting. The smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield) but it wouldn't work with my throws. They started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all hudled together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they figured it out it was too late, I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. It covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about.  I could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me, they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. She ran over and hugged me so tightly I thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. It's been ten years since then and I still talk to my friend, she even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. I guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives, and helps people become closer then ever before. My friend still says that it was the best day of her life. Some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how I am and want to see me do something like it again. Unfortunately I had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. I imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what I did.	22	18	40
21110	8	" Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We're all born with the ability to laugh. Laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the beginning so we don't really think about how important laughing can be. It gives us a sense of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like background or language. I think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together. When you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell of a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION2 who I hadn't seen since I was two years old.   My brother and I were the only ones visiting from our family. So we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel comfortable, or introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 because although I can understand and speak in @CAPS1, I'm not fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family I never knew was very important to me and I was afraid that language would prevent that. I was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @CAPS1 very well at all. While on the plane I contemplated how I should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepare answers for certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere.   Finally it was time to arrive in @LOCATION2. We landed in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 where a lot of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @CAPS3 waved enthusiastically. Then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. As we met them for the first time we exchanged hugs and phrases like ""I'm happy to meet you."" @CAPS3 were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like I was meeting my family. Things were very different and new for us. It was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag.   The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @LOCATION1. It was pretty awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @CAPS4 was a lot harder then I had thought. The first night passed as I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with, but never really known.   At last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. We drove into the downtown area of @ORGANIZATION1 and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @ORGANIZATION1 is right on the coast. I related to my cousins more because @CAPS3 were younger, in @CAPS3're mid twenty, and generally I can get along easier with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. As we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food came and we started to eat. While we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. My brother and I were laughing so hard we teared up. During the whole dinner there was laughter and smiles. At that time I really began to feel like @CAPS3 were my family. I was really thankful for my cousin who started the laughter, because with out all the laughing I don't think we would have bonded so quickly.That was the time I felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer with the people I love."	23	22	45
21111	8	" Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr. theres always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you dont experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to eachother that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for eachother. We had arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning, we were all a little tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS2.Pepper That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION3 fan you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS2.Pepper! oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON2 all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to take his @CAPS2. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to upack our stuffso that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON1 and I took all of his @CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things, we didnt want him to do that because he would then realize that we had took his pop, so we immedietly ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to exoeriencing another one of those @LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't 'till the night time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls we tired, not even @PERSON3, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Tme passed and we were all still awake, we were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON2's pop. We starred them down as if they were some prized possesion or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave, therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second biggest race of @PERSON3's life was going to take place, and ... we were still in bed! of course @PERSON2 got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock, we figured it would be @PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and big old bald man was standing there and said "" i'm only going to say this once"". I need my @CAPS2.Pepper. It was so funny we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because old bald man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON3 not racing card, we were terrified for our lives!, especially @PERSON3, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious, then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS2.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day, ""messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig, you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it"""	18	18	36
21127	8	It was a normal sunny day in the country hill's of @ORGANIZATION1. The sun was out and shineing on the creek that me, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE1. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON1, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little brigde that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE1.  Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sun filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different then normall. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was alittle mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that lead to my house, @PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didnt believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM1 seconds. All of the sudden @PERSON2 screamed run! My brother and i turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast i could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and i wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surround my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to deside weather we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he made it and soo did @ORGANIZATION2. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up alittle and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought i was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and i flung over the fence and face planted it. It was super embbarrasing. My friend and brother were both laughing histarically at me. I could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell. Again. Although i still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a row boat were my brother and friend was and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scareiest thing i had experianced all @DATE1. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about eachothers faces as we where running and how funny it was that i face planted it. They made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though i was embarrased that i tripped over the fence, I still found my self laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE1. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crieing. We all asked her what was soo funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to point we all cried. We all told the story the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt by the end of @TIME1. Laughing is great. It mends the soul. Plus its a great ab work out!!!!	17	18	35
21131	8	" Laughter is huge part of life. Or so that is what I believe and grew up with. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."" @CAPS1 quote has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life.  My mother is quite the entertainer. People have told her that she should become a comedian. Apparently our family stories are very amusing. Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another. He's adventurous, spontaneous, and is not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions are not the smartest. A majority of the stories my mom talks about are from when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular.   When my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities. Like extreme rollerblading, biking, and skateboarding. He would try to do every trick in the book and then some. @CAPS1 story, however, does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend @CAPS2.  When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at age eleven or twelve, we were at one of my soccer games. My brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back, my mom was not pleased. He went to use the port-o-potty and he had just gotten two new shirts; a white t-shirt to go under a new button-up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t-shirt but kept on the button-up. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it into the rancid, disgusting excrement. If @CAPS4 ask him, it was all an accident and my mom was not happy about it.  My mom is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter. I think about her words of wisdom all the time, ""@CAPS3 when it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all @CAPS4 can do. If @CAPS4 embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people @CAPS4 need to laugh it off. If @CAPS4 can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does."" @CAPS4 need to get through life somehow. Might as well make it the best, and laughter is truly the best. It makes my mood better, and makes me feel welcome and at home.    There are many stories about what my brother did, or how blond I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day.""  "	20	15	35
21135	8	 I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!	17	23	40
21145	8	"I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and,how they feel about you,@CAPS1 that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you. @CAPS1 you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person.Laughter is from the heart and soul. @CAPS1 that person Tell's you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two. Feelings,@CAPS2, @CAPS3 is a lot between two people. @CAPS3 is from the soul and down deep with in your body. as my mom would say @CAPS3 helps clear the mind and body , but what i really think is that @CAPS1 some one makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. you laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh. @CAPS1 it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about @CAPS3 is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and,then @CAPS4 it is funny then you start @CAPS3 about it. Here is what my mom use to says to everyone is that ""@CAPS4 you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body"". There are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, i think @CAPS3 is just a feeling that people have. You @MONTH1 tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start @CAPS3 because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh. There are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell my self almost everyday that @CAPS4 I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul. But is it really about me no it is not. @CAPS1 you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't. What you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean. I have been told funny things over the past few years but im a teenager what do you think i will remember them all. I am just like everyone else I will forget them over the years real easy. I not all that smart but after I think about it for a few min I finally under stand the joke. I know I am a @CAPS5 but I have those days where I am saying what to people what are you talking about, then they look at me and, they just say wow! you really are @CAPS5 and I also have @CAPS5 jokes about me and I really do not mind @CAPS1 people tell @CAPS5 jokes to me. Cause I am not affected at all I got use to it. @CAPS1 I heard my first @CAPS5 joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me. Then I walk up to them and I was like ""@CAPS6 I finally got that joke and, then I was like what a really good joke. @CAPS1 you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you. They might even tell you a very funny story about themselves, or someone that is related to them. @CAPS1 you laugh is like your showing your feelings and, @CAPS2 to that person, because @CAPS4 you do laugh then it is just like wow you are really lost on what they where trying to tell you. I will always tell my self @CAPS4 i need a laugh or something to either call my friends up or just look in the mirror every morning. because for some odd reason i think i am just really funny looking. most people think that @CAPS4 you look at your self and make funny faces in the mirror you will laugh non stop. the reason i laugh is because i see or hear something really funny o just wanna laugh so much. @CAPS4 i have a good day or a good weekend i laugh a lot"	17	15	32
21149	8	" Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong."	16	20	36
21167	8	 Recently over the @DATE2 of @DATE1 I was fortunate enough to meet my uncle whom I have never consciously met. This to me was a major part of learning about my family because I met up with not only my uncle , but my legitimate comedian aunt who I have known since I could remember ,and my father at a local @CAPS1 restaurant called @ORGANIZATION2. These three were all siblings, and this allowed me to peer into what siblings will joke about , talk about , and bring forth a feeling of nostalgia for each other. I myself have a stepsister, but the degree of nonsense being presented before me was of a much greater magnitude than I could ever fathom. Everyone was constantly in a state of laughter from the stories of the shenanigans that my father and his brother and @CAPS2 managed to get into. At one point I started having a very hard time breathing.The stories and all-together bad jokes being distributed made me understand that in my family there have been a long line of relatives who inherited some gene that forces us to tell bad jokes. Not even inappropriate but plain stupid jokes. I realized that my children will be telling bad jokes. We dined there for a couple of hours before my dad had to leave for his home up in @LOCATION3, and I needed to be taken home to my family here in @LOCATION4. But tomorrow was planned for a day of exploration of @ORGANIZATION3 and plenty of stupid jokes to be exchanged. I woke up the next day got dressed and prepared myself for laughter I was aware I would be keeling over because of. When I met with uncle and my aunt as well as my uncle's girlfriend we set off towards the fish hatchery on what I believe was the @LOCATION1. All the jokes started slow because everyone was tired and still waking for the rest of the day's trip. We arrived at the hatchery and we began by feeding some fish they have out in a pond.We watched the fish as they swam around in their concrete canals for at least twenty minutes. We then progressed through the hatchery and soon returned to the car and made our trip to @ORGANIZATION1. Once we had parked outside the @ORGANIZATION1 we could hear the beautiful sound of rushing, so beautiful I really needed to pee. We walked along the paths and eventually climbed up a an outlined path to get a get closer view of the @ORGANIZATION1 and we were enthralled. I was being tortured by the thought of using the restroom. I was able to hold it, but it shortened our visit to the @ORGANIZATION1 which was an inconvenience to everyone else but they obliged. I will remember the @ORGANIZATION1 for it's pure natural beauty. After visiting the @ORGANIZATION1 we were going to the very tourist friendly town of @CAPS2's @ORGANIZATION3. We drove by and I nearly lost my mind when I saw the alpacas. Before we did anything at @CAPS2's I first found a restroom and we were later all in agreement that we should get something to eat. A @CAPS4 themed restaurant was an obvious choice and we decided to satisfy our hunger at this fine establishment. They seated us and our host was a very nice young woman. we scanned the menu for something that sounded appetizing. I had found this restaurant was a winner of tastiest burger awards. Falling into temptation I had to order one of these burgers. I do not regret doing this because it was one of the best burgers I have ever had the delight of eating. After satisfying the hunger plaguing us , our group began to browse the gift-shops and the silly novelties that they carried. From bookstores to art galleries to a shop that sold nuts and spices until we came upon an @CAPS5-cream shop. After walking around for the day, @CAPS5-cream was the best thing in our mind to have at the time. I had a very peculiar flavor with berries in it. But I've yet to try a significantly better flavor. When we got our @CAPS5-cream my uncle began to share stories of @LOCATION5 which is where he was visiting from. Quite honestly I wish I could have gone back with him to @LOCATION5, it sounded like a grand city with plenty of places to explore. Sadly I could not, but it is now my goal to eventually visit him where he is living in @LOCATION5. We finished our @CAPS5-cream and then made our way toward the car and drove to @PERSON1 to eat at a very good @CAPS9 restaurant @NUM1o @CAPS10's. We dined there and our stomach was full of exquisite food, almost an entire day of very tasty and savory delights. That was my uncle's @DATE1 day in @LOCATION2. I now wish he would visit more often because of the good time we had on our little expedition across @LOCATION2 with the plethora of bad jokes and stories along with it.	20	20	40
21181	8	" It was a regular day in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That special day we were supposed to start our state writing tests. I wasn't necessarily worried about it due to the fact that I have always done good on state testing, and never failed at test for state testing. @CAPS22 it was pretty much a regular day for @PERSON1. But I didn't know @CAPS18 awaited me in the computer lab..... Thanks to new @ORGANIZATION1 state testing laws, we have to take the writing test on the computer. The only place in the school that has enough computers for the whole class to take was the either the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, or the old computer lab (I don't know why we used the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, but we did). @CAPS22, I was already in a hyper mood because @CAPS1's sense of humor normally cheers me up and puts me in a hyper mood. @CAPS22, as we were walking to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 started cracking jokes about @PERSON3 mainly because everyone else does, @CAPS22 we just add to the effect. @CAPS19 we reached the computer lab, but the door was locked. @CAPS22 while we waited for @PERSON2 to lock her door and come down to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 made a few more jokes about @PERSON3, but little did I know the real humor was awaiting for me in the computer lab. When @PERSON2 got to the door and unlocked it, I was the @ORGANIZATION1 to come in and sit down in the seat I desired. @PERSON4 followed next to me, and @CAPS4 next to him. I remember a trick with the computer when you push @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 and when it goes to a different screen, you push @CAPS8 and it will put the computer to sleep. I tried it a couple times while he was looking and he would always swat my hand away. After a while, I decided the best way to pull this trick was to make him forget about it, @CAPS19 do it when he was least expecting it. @CAPS22 about @NUM1 minutes later after I planned my trick, I tried it again. I caught him looking away at @CAPS4. @CAPS22 I pushed @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7. @CAPS19 it went to a different screen and I pushed @CAPS8. My plan had worked. @CAPS19 @PERSON4 turned around right as soon as the computer was going to sleep and freaked out. He started cussing and hitting me. I thought this was mildly funny @CAPS22 I got a couple laughs out of it, but nothing could have prepared me for @CAPS18 was about to happen. After @PERSON4 woke his computer up and got started with his test, @CAPS4 asked @CAPS18 I was laughing about. I told him, ""@CAPS15, you should have seen it. I put @PERSON4's computer to sleep and he flipped out on me."" @CAPS4 laughed and went back to his test. Two minutes went by and @CAPS4 tapped on my shoulder. I looked at him and asked, ""@CAPS18 up kid?"" @CAPS19 @CAPS4 said, ""@CAPS21 this."" @CAPS22 I sat up straight and looked at him. @CAPS19 he asked @PERSON4, ""@CAPS18 did @PERSON1 do to your computer? This?"" and he held the power button down and shut the computer off right in the middle of @PERSON4's test. I thought I was going to cry. It was @CAPS22 funny me and @CAPS4 started laughing as loud as possible. @PERSON2, of course, wasn't happy about it. @CAPS22 she told me and @CAPS4 to quiet down. But it didn't matter. A little scolding didn't compare to how funny it was.  @CAPS22 we ended up going back to our own tests. I hope I do good on this. I really need the grade to pass."	15	22	40
21182	8	" Have @CAPS3 ever been in that mood were @CAPS3 just can not stop laughing, and no matter what, @CAPS3 just can't stop? That is the problem my good friend, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I have when we are together. Most of the time we are just talking about random things and we both find it hilarious. Luckily, for the teachers, we only have two classes together. In both of those classes we sit next to each other though. So the teachers didn't luck out too much.  Just the other day, in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we were allowed to move are seats around and have that be our new spot in the class. The girl that was sitting next to me moved and sat next to @PERSON1. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't like this girl very much, so I spoke up and said ""@PERSON1, @CAPS3 can sit next to me!"". @PERSON1 grabbed her stuff in an unusually quick manner, and came and sat next to me. The funny thing was when she sat down she said ""@CAPS3 saved my life."". For some reason @PERSON1 and I just started laughing non-stop. We couldn't control it. To be honest, it wasn't that funny. I guess it was just in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad @PERSON1 sits next to me in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With out her, it would be so boring.  In @CAPS6, we sit next to each other and we have a good time. Our @CAPS6 class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by then. @PERSON1 and I sit next to each other and when we are taking notes, @PERSON1 and I pass notes back-and-forth to each other. She and I talk about everything, from the predicaments a teenage girl runs into in high school, to boys and parents. I can pretty much tell her everything, and that's a good friend. Over the years @PERSON1 and I have become closer and closer friends. Last year, she and I had at least three or four classes together. So we have been in classes together previously. @PERSON1 and I have become more acquainted and more open with things. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. One reason why I think we've become good friends is because she and I find the same things funny. We have the same interests in things.She is a good friend and I'm glad she's my friend . Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I am going to definitely have to agree with that."	15	16	31
21190	8	" When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the "" big kid"" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION1 followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM1,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION1 parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION3. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2'. There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION1 i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION1 began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.  finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked ""how many?"". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION1 said ""row eight"". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION1 they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION1 stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION1 some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION1 the yelled "" blast off"" @ORGANIZATION1 the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION1 plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION1 turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION1 I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on I was addicted to roller coasters, @ORGANIZATION1 have ridden many since."	18	18	36
21227	8	" For me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things that I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I'm happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS2 always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS2's actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @CAPS2's possible that people don't think @CAPS2's funny because they weren't there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON1. She is from @LOCATION2. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON1 never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @CAPS5 boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION4. I sure think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @CAPS2 is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, ""I am not a midget! I am @NUM1' @NUM2'', you have to be @NUM1' @NUM4'' to be a midget!"" @CAPS2 is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. ""@CAPS2's a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2,"" my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION3 for @CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON1. She seemed so quiet and sweet. @CAPS2 was late when we got home so I immediately went to sleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then called @PERSON2 and asked her to come over and hang out with me. She came and met @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and I replied, ""@CAPS5, that's tomorrow, lets go into town."" All three of us went to town and went to @ORGANIZATION1 For @CAPS6. When we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. Somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON2 picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted, ""@CAPS7 @PERSON1, what about these?"" @PERSON1 looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back,""@CAPS8, I don't think my thighs would fit through that!"" @PERSON2 and I literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, ""keep to herself"" kind of girl so we just thought @CAPS2 was hilarious. We tease @PERSON1 about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we've encountered. I've grown to love @PERSON1 and I love being with her and making fun out of all situations.

21235	8	" A great day for an adventure @CAPS5 my sister invited me to her christion school called @PERSON1 , @CAPS1 was a nice sunny day and then @CAPS1 turned in to a not so sunny day. Woke up first day of visiting my sister in her new school ,went to all her classes with her ,the teachers were kinda wired and so were her friends ,after second period in @PERSON1 we went to her @CAPS2.E class the teacher said to put on running shose besause we are going to run up a mountian, my sister had forgoten to put on her running shose so the teacher sent me and her to go get them after we got the shose the class was already a quarter of a mile away from the school so me and my sister desided to take a short cut so we took the off road ""the seanic root"". We had ran down a hill and @CAPS1 was really a steep , my sister got half way down the hill and slid on her butt all the way down after she went I went so I ran down the hill faster then I had ever ran in my life and I hit the pavement at the bottom I was like a tumble-weed in a huricane my sister helped me up and we started running tword the class and they were in ""shock"" of what me and my sister looked like my sister looked like she had just got done playing in the mud me on the other hand looked like I got hit by a truck and my face was covered in dirt, @CAPS3 after me and my sister got back we decided to get cleaned up, so we went to the showers the showers at @PERSON1 are similer to the ones in @CAPS4.H.S but with shower curtins the shower that I had used the curtin had came off this medel hook and I wasnt being smart and used a plastic stepping stool the ground was still wet from @CAPS5 I had took a shower and the stool sliped and my pinkey got cought on the hook and I sliced @CAPS1 open on a main vain in my pinky I started getting light-headed and I passed out my sister and her friends took me to my sisters room and put a band-ade on @CAPS1 @CAPS5 i was still passed out.

21249	8	 It was the first day of the ninth grade, that terrifying day when one must choose how they are to be percieved for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds of long haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and that made it difficult for bullies to muster up the machismo to treat me as the freshman that I was. I sat down in my designated seat, next to one of the girls I could tell thought too highly of herself. Despite this off putting first impression, I atteampted friendship. My atteampt was met with confusion and disgust.  As I turned to face the front of the class once more, there stood the teacher. @PERSON1 announced that our first assignment was to create a presentation, one that would show the rest of the class who we are. I was excited at the prospect of a presentation. I have always been a showman, and the limelight is a very dear friend. I love to act, sing, and in general entertain. My crown jewel however, is humor. I have found that I can captivate an audience no matter the number, with humor. With this I designed a presentation to entrap and engage my class in the reality of who, and what I am. I wrote a speech in which I explained my talents and the many things I enjoy. In this speech were many twists and turns of phrase, punchlines and puns. There was such laughter that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise.  I took a bow and sat in my seat, looking around at the shining faces of my new friends. I knew then and there that laughter would be the tool with which i would build my highschool life. I could make someone forget about their troubles for a spell, or brighten someones day with a few words. I wasn't a star athlete. I wasn't even a star pupil. But I seemed to collect friends like I was made of fly paper. There is no better feeling i have yet felt, that compares to the company of friends. As long as i have humor, I shall never be without that feeling.	22	20	42
21263	8	"I could just laugh to death. someone said. I sacned the area. ""@CAPS37?"" I said. ""@CAPS1 here son."" I looked @CAPS1 the stairs leading to @CAPS2 avenue. There was the sorce of the voice i had herd. @CAPS35 was only an old man probualy homeless by the looks of him. He had worn shoes, dirty blue jeans, a riped shirt under a worn jacket. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS31 @CAPS33 a little lost""The old man said. ""@CAPS4, I'm @CAPS73 lost"" said @PERSON1. His pocket started to vibrate. @PERSON1 reached into his pocket an pulled out his cell. He fliped @CAPS35 open and read: @CAPS31 going to be here soon? Tommey typed: ya bro just going onto @CAPS2 ave now. Message sent. @PERSON1 started to climb the steps. ""@CAPS5 @CAPS31 later old man"" said @PERSON1 as he dashed of to meet his friends. @PERSON1 saw his friends in site @CAPS62 were all standing outside of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 bakery. ""@CAPS3,guys @CAPS33 @CAPS35's @PERSON1!"" @CAPS34 @PERSON2. @PERSON2 ran at @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 scuped her @CAPS1 and spun her around one before puting her @CAPS66 @CAPS19. @CAPS62 proceeded to walk over to the group. ""@CAPS37 took @CAPS31 so long dude"" said @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS11, @CAPS63 the short cut i took turned out to be, @CAPS73 to short"" @PERSON1 repiled. ""@CAPS12 don't mind him he's just in a bad mood"" said @CAPS13. ""@CAPS14"" replied @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3, guys can we go into the @CAPS18 @CAPS19's toy store!!"" inqured @PERSON2. ""@CAPS20 that's fine"" replied @CAPS13 @CAPS22. The group proceeded @CAPS19 @CAPS2 avenue @CAPS24 turned right onto @ORGANIZATION1 street, @CAPS24 another right onto @CAPS25 avenue. The store was located halfway @CAPS19 in the middle of other boutiques. ""@CAPS26 were here"" said @PERSON2 as she spun around around from excitement. ""@CAPS24 let's go in"" said @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS30 old greblin!"" said @PERSON2. ""shh mu ha ha ha"" @CAPS31 got told said @CAPS13. ""@CAPS32"" he grumbled. Once inside the store @CAPS35 was like somone turned @CAPS9 the lights @CAPS9 bright. @CAPS73 only that but the store was filled from top to bottom with @CAPS38 but toys. The toys ranged from small to large to huge. There were all sorts of diffrent types. ""@CAPS33"" @CAPS34 @PERSON2.

""@CAPS3, don't be mean to her!"" said @CAPS13 as she picted @CAPS1 a monester an flung @CAPS35 at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. @CAPS35 missed and hit @PERSON1. @PERSON1 flung @CAPS35 @CAPS66 at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""That's @CAPS35"" I @CAPS9 @CAPS10 challege @CAPS31. SMAK. ""@CAPS52"" @CAPS53 this. @CAPS53 that. @CAPS54 @CAPS54 @CAPS31 scum. @CAPS31 can't get me. WAM! Ha ha i'm ausome. TWACK!

21264	8	"I tend to always get myself into awkward situations with the people i love, but that's just life right? When your a kid you tend to be dramatic about every little thing, an to those who love you @DATE1 are trying to teach you something @DATE1 or lead you the right way. Or maybe that was just me, haha? I moved out of my dads, with a horrible bang. I wanted to live life my way, which was only pushing the people i needed most away. I realized that a little too late. But again, that's just life right? Just about @DATE1 i finally ""rekindled the flame"" with my dad again. It was the hardest thing to do, considering my step mom hates me. @DATE1 that's obviously never going to change. So that's just something i'll have to deal with. My dad @DATE1 i still had the most awkward relationship, till about a few months ago when we had gone on a fishing trip together. Standing there, casting away there was nothing said. We both consider ourselfves fairily humorous people, but even our jokes wern't breaking through the ice. We finally started making conversation @DATE1 he started to tell me about when i was a kid going @DATE1 visiting my mom for the first time, then coming back to my grandmas @DATE1 calling her a......bad word...but i wont say which one. My dad hasnt every really cursed around me before, i guess that's time away for you. It was pretty funny all these stories he was telling me, @DATE1 the way he was explaing them. That brought pretty happy laughter to us both. @DATE1 really brought us back together again."	17	19	36

We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while.  @CAPS3 younger brother, @PERSON1, and I, we have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS3 way to say hi to @CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS3 own brother. @PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together. One night, at the dinner table, @CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that @PERSON1 never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION1's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON1 blurted out, ""yeah, @LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."" @CAPS3 parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON1, it was!! It was @CAPS3 turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS3 parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, ""I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."" I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS3 vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS3 laughter. @CAPS3 parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS3 mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS3 mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS3 hand over @CAPS3 mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS3 grip was so hard that it made @CAPS3 teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS3 whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine!

21288	8	"Sometimes, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 I glanced around nervously as much mother drove up to the strange and unfamiliar building that was to be @CAPS6 new @ORGANIZATION2. ""@CAPS5 around! We can come back another time...or @CAPS2 not come back at all."" @CAPS6 mother laughed and continued to search for a parking spot. I slumped down in @CAPS6 seat, discouraged and lonely. @DATE1 was the first day of @CAPS6 sophomore year in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2, and I had to spend it at a new @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2; @ORGANIZATION1. Transferring to a new @ORGANIZATION2 would not @CAPS3 been so bad if I hadn't been forced to leave the @ORGANIZATION2 I loved, the @ORGANIZATION2 I had friends in, the @ORGANIZATION2 which met @CAPS6 selective needs and wants. I was dreading this day and only wished I could go home and sleep this vivid nightmare away.  @CAPS6 mom had to practically drag me from our minivan to the @ORGANIZATION2 doors, for both @CAPS6 body and mind were aching to run in the opposite direction. There was a massive crowd of students swarming around the room, which would later be known to me as ""the commons."" @CAPS6 mom introduced me to the woman in charge, @PERSON3, then waved goodbye and headed back to the car. I felt nauseous, and @CAPS6 heart was pounding as I glanced around at @CAPS6 new peers. I did not see even one familiar or friendly face. Not being an outgoing person was a struggle for me, especially when I was faced with new surroundings, such as this @ORGANIZATION2. The truth was, I didn't even want to make any friends. I @CAPS2 wanted to go back to @ORGANIZATION2;@CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION2.  As the day progressed, @CAPS6 mood only got worse. No one had even tried to be nice to me, and I wasn't really trying either. As the students were taking a field trip down to the @CAPS9 campus down the street, I ran into a girl who looked @CAPS2 as uncomfortable as I did. @CAPS14 had long, blond, straight hair, brown eyes, and a pierced nose. We started walking together, our steps in sync with each other, although no words were exchanged. We both @CAPS2 felt more comfortable standing next to each other, rather than standing alone. At the @CAPS9 campus, I decided to abandon @CAPS6 timid, protective shell, and I asked her where @CAPS14 was from. ""@LOCATION1,"" @CAPS14 replied. ""@CAPS6 family moved here last @DATE2, so I was home schooled until the end of the year,"" @CAPS14 informed me, her voice laced with nervousness. We continued to make small talk as our group took a tour through the building. I still had not learned her name though because I couldn't read the handwriting on her name tag, and I was too embarrassed to ask what it was. Fortunately @CAPS14 started talking about her name. ""@CAPS6 parents named me @PERSON1 because @CAPS6 mom is @CAPS13, and I guess @CAPS14 really liked that name."" @CAPS14 shrugged and rolled her eyes. @CAPS14 told me I could call her by her nickname, @PERSON2, because @CAPS14 didn't like people talking to her using her full name.  After our tour, all the groups of students headed back to the @ORGANIZATION2, for we were going to @CAPS3 a pizza party for lunch. As @PERSON2 and I sat in the corner munching on our food, we studied the kids around us. ""@CAPS15...This is going to be the worst year ever,"" I said gloomily. We stared pitifully at each other for a moment, sizing up the difficult times ahead of us. Then, simultaneously, we both cracked a smile. Next thing I knew, we were laughing hysterically, our bodies rocking back and forth with every breathe that managed to escape our lips.  Sometimes, when life throws me lemons, instead of making lemonade, I pucker up @CAPS6 lips at the thought of how sour they are, and I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to @CAPS4. Although laughing did not automatically make @CAPS6 new @ORGANIZATION2 a fun and welcoming place, it made it @CAPS2 a little more bearable. Laughter truly is the best medicine, no matter what the illness or problem is, and it can make two strangers into friends almost immediately."	23	23	46
21309	8	" Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I strongly agree with these people, because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can put anyone into a better mood. Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do. Having agood time with friends and family and laughing with them is truly something to be greatful for. I have had several situations filled with laughter. @CAPS2 I am greatful for. My two best friends, @PERSON2@NUM1, and I, well lets just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not laughter involved. So many times we've laughed at ourselves and each other I've lost count. It's so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with. There are so many times that we have laughed at eachother I don't even know where to begin. One time we were all at @ORGANIZATION1's house and we were playing hide and seek in her back yard. It was my turn to be the seeker. I came out of the house after counting to @NUM2. As I searched the yard I found everyoneeventually, except @PERSON2. As I wondered the yard looking for her the others started helping me look for her.We could hear her laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell where. She started talking to us saying things like ""@CAPS1 here!"" or ""@CAPS2 way!"". After getting frustrated and giving up, she finally revealed herself...on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even knowing how she got up there in the firstplace.  Another time we had gone to pizza for my @NUM3 birthday party. We went into the arcade room with the moneywe had ready to play some games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine, because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course @ORGANIZATION2 had to try it just once. Next thing we, knewwe were using all of our money trying to win at @CAPS2 game. We each eventually won something, screaming, cheering, and laughing hysterically like kindergartners. We had also played @CAPS2 race car game at least ten timesand we were running out of games to play. So to relieve our boredom we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was a very fun time.  I couldn't possibly tell all of these stories. That would take hours, days, maybe even weeks. But I can tell youthat laughter is definitely a huge part of our day to day lives. I consider myself a very lucky person to have suchgreat friends that laughter is such a common thing for us. Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have thisopportunity. A little laughter can go a long way. So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh, talk to them, attempt to be their friend, make them laugh. The resultwill be its own reward. Trust me."	20	18	38
21315	8	"Laughter: A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of the variety of emotions expressed by humans, there are emotions that represent different qualities. While furrowed brows @MONTH1 be associated with displeasure, anger, or even confusion, laughter is an action connotative to mainly one emotion - happiness. Although emotions are relative aspects of human nature, actions such as laughter exist to transcribe an emotion like happiness into physiological expressions that humans are able to understand. Due to this unique quality as an action, laughter is often a key element in developing relationships. Over the years, I have found that laughter is crucial because of three various reasons - laughter does not separate, it is an ability that all members of the human race have in common, and additionally, it brings down personal barriers. In many aspects, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""; instances of laughter are @CAPS1 anecdotes. Unlike sentiments such as jealousy, fury, or sorrow, happiness is an emotion that tends not to separate. While jealousy, fury, and sorrow can cause such discontentment between people to the point of physically and emotionally driving them apart from each other, happiness does no such thing. Happiness is conducive to laughter, and because of this, laughter congregates people together, rather than dispelling them apart.  In addition to its compelling nature, laughter is also a @CAPS1 action. In a general view, laughter gives humans another point at which they are equal; the ability to laugh is one quality humans share. Even infants, in their states of vulnerable dependency, are able to emit laughter. Laughter is also able to establish starting points for new relationships, because sharing a laugh is akin to establishing commonalities between people. Whether the commonality be a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a surprise, sharing a laugh automatically institutes a link between two or more people. Additionally, while laughter can begin new relationships, it can also solidify them. Often, as laughter is shared through common experiences, having common experiences to laugh about symbolizes a relationship between people in itself. Since laughter is mainly about relationships and interactions between people, it is also about building trust. Establishing connections between one person and another, regardless of how weak the connection might be, requires some form of trust. Laughter is often able to bring down emotional barriers because it requires a sense of kinship and camaraderie. Through laughter, we as humans are able to bring down notions of suspicion or anxiety. As stated before, laughter establishes commonalities and therefore is an activity that exudes a sense of trust and reliability. This razing of emotional barriers is another way in which laughter is able to bring people closer together.  Laughter is a @CAPS1 action that ""personifies"" how similar members of the human race are. It is astounding how man is able to discern qualities such as reliability and trustworthiness simply through the complex, yet basic, act of sharing a laugh. Through laughter, people are subconsciously able to make emotional connections with their fellow human entities and in doing so, are able to take interaction to an emotional level. Laughter is the true story behind human relationships worldwide. Not only is laughter the @CAPS1 language, laughter's intimate nature renders it the shortest distance between two people."	20	15	35
21321	8	 My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment.	20	18	40
21323	8	 Most people believe that laughter is an essential need for your heath, not only physically, but socially as well. In a socially tense environment it is hard to achieve what is expected of you, but if someone will introduce laughter into the environment, it quickly changes into one that becomes more simplistic, and you are able to get done what is expected of you. With this mindset I proceeded into the conference room for the first time since @PERSON1 had left. @PERSON1 was the adviser for the @ORGANIZATION1, or what we call @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was the reason that a student from each school in @LOCATION1 had any say in what the @ORGANIZATION1 did or received school wise. She helped us voice our opinions and that made her a hero in the eyes of many high school students! Soon, @PERSON1's time as adviser had expired and she announced her departure from her position. After a few weeks had gone by she had found a new adviser to take her place, @PERSON2. I'm a person who is excepting of change, but the other members are not. This particular change was much to hefty for them; they just wanted things to go back to normal. When I sat down in my usual chair, the room seemed much less homely and I soon felt a sick feeling building up inside. I did not know who this woman was or what she was going to do; all I knew was that she was not @PERSON1, and she did not make the @ORGANIZATION2 members very happy.  @PERSON2 glided into the room with a welcoming spirit about her. She stood at the head of the room and smiled. The rest of the members sunk a little further into their chairs, as if they were protesting her arrival. I thought to myself, she doesn't stand a chance, as I sat a little taller and began to listen to what she had to say. She spoke in a cheerful tone and seemed to giggle after every sentence. Although her posture provoked confidence, her giggle struck nervousness. There was only one way we, as a @ORGANIZATION2, were going to get done what was needed. We had to see @PERSON2 as a friend not a foe. Immediately I decided to lighten the dank feeling in the room by starting a name game. This is a fun activity to learn a little more about people and to help @PERSON2 to remember our names. @PERSON2 seemed much more relaxed after the game so we continued with the meeting. With every second getting more serious I proposed that the meeting be done for the week and we spend the rest of the time talking and laughing about what had gone on that week. This made everyone smile. Time went on and with every passing moment the stress in the room became lighter and lighter, until the whole room was filled with laughter. It was as if @PERSON1 had never left! Soon the gathering came to a close and we all went home. On my way out @PERSON2 stopped me and told of her nervousness before the meeting because she wasn't sure how well everything was going to go. She was thankful that I jumped right in and helped brighten the spirits of the members. This eventually lead to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of @ORGANIZATION2. By the next meeting the members were all anxious to go back and learn a little more about @PERSON2, and were able to more fully concentrate on the matters at hand. Laughter helped the members of the @ORGANIZATION2 accept what they could not control and ultimately lead to our success today. Laughter is primarily the key to all success in the social society we live in today; with laughter anything is possible! Although the laughter was only for that one meeting, it allowed the members to be more welcoming to the idea of @PERSON2, and made for a life long friendship between our adviser, and the members of our @ORGANIZATION2. My relationship with @PERSON2 would not be as strong as it is today, if I did not share the opportunity to laugh at @PERSON2's first @ORGANIZATION2 meeting.	23	20	43
21325	8	" The night was a cool, @DATE1 night, not too cold but definetly not the muggy temperatures @DATE2 brought you. This was the type of @NUM1 degree weather that would allow you to wear jeans and a t-shirt and still be comfortable. The air hugged my skin as I walked up the path that led to my friends front door. Overhead I knew the stars hung in the sky but they were paid no attention by me. Inside the house I knew both of my bestfriends were awaiting my arrival. I also knew that there was a potential of them being angry with me. For what, I did not know. I did know that when I left school that day there was a feeling in my gut that told me something wasn't right. Walking home, as I increased the distance between them and me, there was a churning in my stomach that prodded me to look back. When I did, they were both staring at me with looks I couldn't (or didn't want to) place on their faces.  All of that made my heart give occasional, hard, thumps on my chest from the nervousness. Yet, I pretended that everything was okay. ""For all I know"", I told myself, ""it might as well be, and I'm overreacting."" I knocked on the white-painted wooden door and stared at the maroon side-paneling, waiting for an answer. My friend @LOCATION1 answered the door. From somewhere inside I could hear my other friend @PERSON1 laughing. I knew that I had missed out on something, the laughter explained that to me as I stepped inside. There was a hollow feeling in my chest. I wanted to know what I had missed out on. I hated not knowing. A mix of emotions jumped around inside my body, causing my head to be a jumbled mess that I couldn't make sense of.  I gently pushed open @LOCATION1's bedroom door with my fingertips. Like always, the turquoise walls and the sound of radio station music jumped out to greet me. @PERSON1 was laughing and dancing to the music, but when she saw me, she stopped and stared. The moment seemed to stretch and expand in time. I felt my guard go up. If she was mad, fine. I didn't do anything wrong and I would maintain my innocence. The moment was stretching and stretching to the point I thought it might break, then @CAPS1 hugged me, completely catching me off gaurd, but filling me with a sense of right, because I'd known I hadn't done anything wrong. Everything seemed normal for what felt like a second and then @PERSON1 explained the gut feeling I had when I was walking home from school that day. I was being accused of not putting in any work into a reading project. The accusation appalled me and deflated my pride. Instead, a mild anger boiled up and I simply walked out the door and into the cool night. I heard my friends calling my name and following me down the street but I kept walking. I told myself this was out of anger, but @DATE3 I know it was for the sake of making a scene.  The footsteps I listened for behind me suddenly came at a faster pace. I glanced over my shoulder and saw @PERSON1 running at me. Against my will, I let out a high-pitched scream and started running, digging my feet into the concrete sidewalk. I felt determination flow through my veins. I would walk all the way home in the dark to make my point. @PERSON1 caught up to me and tried to pull me back to the house but I resisted with all my might. I knew I couldn't get out of her grip, out of sheer stubborness, I planted my butt on the curb and refused to budge. I realized I had only passed two houses. My friends exchanged glances and picked me up by my arms and legs and started carrying me towards the direction of the house. I grasped for the anger that was slipping from my hands. I wanted to stay mad but I couldn't. I started laughing and any tension I still felt swarming around me lifted up and flew away. A grin decorated my face from one ear to the other and my good sense came back to me gracefully. They set me down in the middle of the road. I looked up and admired the stars, that I had missed before, winking at me from above. The last ribbons of laughter still danced around in the air and whispered to me that everything was going to be okay."	25	20	45
21351	8	Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1,@CAPS2,Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negativly andthen there's some that take it positivley i believe that those @NUM1 words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearence. Im going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. Im @NUM2 years old now but i was @NUM3 when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM4 years old now. but he was @NUM2 when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS1 it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM1 years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS2 my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she's honest, and kind but because she's funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplist things ever most people @MONTH1 think we are crazy, we aren't that just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long. life with laughter is like a curvey road you just dont know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship we do alot of things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that momment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to enojy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memmories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happend, when and where. So when ever something happens to you that you @MONTH1 consider emberassing look back at it a year from that day im sure you will get a laugh or atleast a smile out of it. 	15	16	31
21352	8	"                   The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS3. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet. Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?"" ""@CAPS6"" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?"" I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS6"". He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner."	17	20	37
21358	8	"Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 do things like music, tears and laughter have in common? @CAPS19're all universal languages- @CAPS19 surpass any @CAPS1 barriers to get the point across without words. @CAPS21 was definitely the case the time my @CAPS3's best friend @PERSON3 came to visit from @LOCATION2.  I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my @CAPS3 announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my @CAPS3 was encouraging. ""@CAPS4 will be a learning experience!"" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. ""@CAPS5'll learn some @CAPS6, and @CAPS19'll learn some @CAPS7.""  @CAPS4 was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when @CAPS19 arrived. As @CAPS19 pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I @CAPS12 felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my ""@CAPS9"" @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @CAPS9 @PERSON3's rich voice: ""@CAPS11! @CAPS5've gotten so tall!"" @CAPS12 I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my @CAPS9: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon @ORGANIZATION1 had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to @ORGANIZATION1's three children. I realized that I didn't know @CAPS2 to say- or even how to say anything to them. While @PERSON3 was bilingual, yet she didn't speak @CAPS7 around her children. There was a total @CAPS1 barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. @PERSON3 bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @PERSON1, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old @CAPS14, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, @PERSON2, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as @PERSON3 introduced me and my sister @CAPS15 to them. As @CAPS19 chattered back at her in @CAPS6, I marveled at how clever @CAPS19 seemed for speaking another @CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my @CAPS7 sound to them?  My @CAPS3 soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and @PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to ""catch up on life."" For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @CAPS4 became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. ""@CAPS18 don't @CAPS5 go show them your rooms?"" my @CAPS3 suggested. ""@CAPS19 still haven't met @CAPS20!"" @CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, since @CAPS20, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. @CAPS15 and I led the way to to find him while the @CAPS23 talked in hushed @CAPS6 voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, @PERSON2 @CAPS12 let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to @CAPS20, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @CAPS20 did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @PERSON2's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so @CAPS4 turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, @CAPS19 looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of @CAPS4, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the @CAPS1 barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because @CAPS4's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @CAPS1 we did have in common- laughter."	23	23	46
21373	8	" In the ninth grade I was required to give a speech about a book. The speech was to be persuasive, like a television or radio advertisement. I am awful at giving speeches. Before speeches my hands get clammy and cold, I experience ""hot flashes,"" and occasionally get nauseous. During speeches my eyes frantically glance around the room, my breathing pattern changes to quick short breathes. Almost in sync with my glances. At the end of my speeches I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock. I do not speak, I do not laugh, and I feel like hiding. Luckily, @CAPS4 speech was different. My @CAPS1 class had all girls and one boy. Not to say I am sexist, but having the majority of the room being female did help. Girls have a way of acceptance, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer.  So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the average classroom setting of ""speech giving time,"" (when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other) the classroom was zoned in on me. Today @CAPS5 felt like everyone was ready to hear me no matter what I really had to say, and how professional @CAPS5 came out. I felt superior, as if I had the power to alter their lives, almost so superior that I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat @CAPS5 up (@CAPS2't that what advertisment is? Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea, and hiding the bad things?). The group looked so innocent. Today I was ready to give my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance, and a smile. I began. My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around @CAPS5 to serve the purpose of a television. @CAPS4 also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the ""actors."" @CAPS3 the first few lines of the speech my group of classroom peers laughed, @CAPS4 was not what they had expected. I am a shy, quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class. I wear things like semi-large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world. A lot of times when I give speeches people laugh, but usually a negative laugh. The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone. @CAPS5's also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter, that just makes the speech a introduction and an ending, bodiless. So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction. The sound of @CAPS4 laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech.  At the end of my speech everyone clapped. They always clap. @CAPS5 is required to clap. @CAPS4 clap was different, @CAPS5 was clapping for the success of the speaker, a clap that said ""@CAPS4 speech had a clear purpose, and made the audience want to keep listening."" @CAPS5 was not a pity clap. Then I smiled. My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded. That I had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what I had to say, and that they had comprehended @CAPS5, and maybe that they would now want to read the book. @CAPS4 was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech. I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying, @CAPS4 was a definite improvement, and also a factor of why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes and comments. Lastly, my puppets also had a introduction, body, and conclusion to their babble. Usually I get so nervous I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel and disrespectful. My speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively. The laughter of the audience was cheery, happy, encouraging, and accepting."	20	20	40
21379	8	  It was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 of @DATE1, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ORGANIZATION1 to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION1, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade? I was with my best friend @PERSON2 and her family. There float was for @ORGANIZATION1. Which is the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that they had owned at the time.   We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only @PERSON2, @PERSON2's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float.   @PERSON2 and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin baby's. I cant remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well behaved baby's, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed to hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly.  We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while @PERSON2 and I had started to get tired from holding the baby's and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though.   The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail.   Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's. At the time I was holding the girl and @PERSON2 was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The baby's were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had.  The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red. Baileys mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the baby's off to the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 manager who was there. Then @PERSON2's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time @PERSON2 even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore.  At the end of the parade @PERSON2's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle marks kids, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa @PERSON4 had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @PERSON2 and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that.  That @ORGANIZATION1 was a good @ORGANIZATION1 for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON2 and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense, and laughing at our selves had made us much closer.   Every relationship whether its intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will effect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives.	18	17	35
21404	8	" Laughter is one of the best things people can learn to do. Laughter is one of the many things I enjoy doing. I love how everyone has their own distinctive laugh, some are loud and some are quiet almost like a giggle. Not only do I enjoy it but I love that is helps me relieve stress, which is a major part of relationships. My boyfriend and I met about three years ago. Today we have been going out for a year and three months. We met whenI was mowing my yard, and my neighbor @LOCATION1 brought him over to introduce us to each other. I mean she couldn't have brought him over at a worse time; I was hot and sweaty because it was eighty degrees out side, I had no make-up on, and I smelled like fresh cut grass what a great first impression huh? ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 this is @PERSON1"" she said with a smile. ""@CAPS3 timing @CAPS4"" I replied with a tone of anger in my voice. ""sorry"" she said, ""but he said he wanted to meet you , and he wouldn't shut up about it."" I looked over at him and noticed that he blushed a little and I laughed. From then on I knew that @PERSON1 and I were going to have something great together. Till this day our relationship is stronger than ever, and it's because we can make each other laugh. Now don't get me wrong, trust, honesty, communication, listening, are all still a big part and those are important too, but I think that having humor and being able to laugh in a relationship is one of the key things to a healthy and long lasting relationship. My boyfriend and I have great sense of humor, and we defiantly like to use it in our relationship. I could have the worst day of my life;and when I talk to him on the phone I know my day is going to change from horrible to fantastic. Just because I know that within the first few minutes of talking to him and hearing his voice, he's going to say something funny and I can't help but to laugh. I honestly believe you need a good sense of humor in your relationship if you want it to last. When you don't have laughter in your relationship, it tends to get very dull and boring. You can't be serious twenty-four seven, that's way too stressful. Since laughter helps relieve stress, you will defiantly need it during your relationship so it doesn't get stressful and turn into nothing but a bunch of fighting and arguing.

21427	8	" Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When your angry, sad, nervous or even mourning. Laughing about the good times @CAPS1 had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in someway or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought. Which made me look on the positive and light-hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, some times hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There was three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what, it was so many years ago. But then on boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes were all eight or nine years old but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says ""@CAPS1 are not in shape, your fat"". This crushed me how was I suppose to reply to this. I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear repeating in my head those evil words that stung me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I could not hold back the tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out if this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter then to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed ""@CAPS2 what's the matter, what happened?"" @CAPS3 tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boys name. I told her @PERSON1. She began to laugh and say ""That chubby kid with the buck teeth?, oh honey don't let that bother @CAPS1 he isn't in shape at all"". I started to laugh realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, which the statement were not even true and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what @PERSON1 said to me. Of course even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless commend about any of this flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation, also. "	17	18	35
21460	8	" I am going to tell you a story about when I was a young boy and, how I used to go on long trip with my father because he was a long-haul truck driver. Me and mi dad went many places around the @LOCATION2 all of them being very fun and amazing. And we all had a lot of laughs The one that i liked the most though was when we went to @LOCATION1 that place was so amazing there are so many things to do, as well as so many things to visit. Things that you could just see like the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that was pretty cool i thought and all of the monuments. My dad told me to go and see if i could get past security at the @ORGANIZATION1 and i was like nah i am good you can though and i laughed at him; @CAPS1 place that i liked a lot that we went to would have to be @LOCATION3, even though it was very hot and muggy it was still fun. I remember my dad telling us that we had a lot of extra time and that he was going to be taking us to the zoo man was that cool we got to see all of the awesome animals such as the lions, the crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas , and the penguins. It was one of the best trips that my father ever took me on i liked it a lot. One of the funniest memories that i do remember is when we were driving throught the desert and there was this paper in the air and i did not know what it was so i was like, ""dad what is that""? and he says ""that is a falling star"" i was like ""in the middle of the day""? and it took me till about a couple years to figure out what it really was but now i know what it was and i just look back to that day and laugh."	15	17	32
21470	8	Laughing is something that everyone experiences. It changes situations from bad to funny. It's like magic. I mean you don't need a wand or anything, just a twisted sense of humor. You just need a little common sense and a little bit of illogical thinking. I know that those are two entirely different things but isn't that what makes us @CAPS4? isn't laughter just the response to hearing something illogical that differs from your common sense? No. It's not. Laughter is also an extremely helpful tool. you can do a lot of things with laughter. you can get out of trouble, get into trouble, start a friendship, end a friendship, get a job, lose a job, win a game and, lose a game. and that's not everything, mind you. But I'm not here to talk about all of those things, just one of them. making friends with laughter. just sit back and listen and maybe you'll learn something.Before we begin the story, let me just start by saying that I'm not exactly the nicest guy on the planet, and i know this, but I'm good at making people @CAPS4. It's not even on purpose half of the time. the majority of my jokes and humor consists of depressing things. I honestly think that I get that response from people because they don't know how else to react. And this is why @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or whoever invented sadists and masochists. Anyway lets get back on track. Once upon a time where teens were desensitized to the harsh reality of modern living there was a kid. that kids name was @PERSON1. now I really hadn't known @PERSON1 for very long and, to be quite honest, i didn't really want to but he tagged along with me and grant and @PERSON3 back in the day. he always wore these awesome iron maiden t-shirts and listened to the type of music that i liked so i guess you could say it was fated but that's neither here nor there. One day we got to talking. We were both thinking about this big barrel that had been left in the track at our school. it was empty and plastic and when you're @NUM1 everything big and red and plastic looks fun. we decided that we would take the barrel and stand on it. Yes that was all we wanted to do with it. It never really crossed our minds that we could have taken it or built something with it. no, the only upstanding conclusion we could come to was to stand on it. and we did. and it was fun.  the next day we came to school and @PERSON1 was handing out invitations to his birthday party. i was pretty excited so i went. as it turns out, our lives are very very much alike. i think the first thing i noticed when i went to his house was the kitchen. it was like they took my kitchen and painted it a different color and then put it there. honestly i thought i was the only kid who lived the way i did. i used to get mad because my mom wouldn't ever buy matching dishes or silverware because we never really had the money and this kid had the most random assortment of dishes and such in his house. collectible versions of different pint glasses, mismatched silverware, logical dish placement. i know it sounds stupid but it used to make me happy.  When the other guys arrived we started to talk, or at least i did. we talked about some random stuff too like @CAPS3 videos and good movies we had seen recently. @PERSON1 and i always ended up talking about other stuff like travel and the future and dogs but that's just because we agreed that newer movies kind of sucked, too many explosions and not enough character development. eventually we started a fire and moved our conversations outside. see, it always seems like things are better when you look into the fire. and when the fire goes out, you want that feeling again. well i was prepared to fix it but everybody went inside except me and @PERSON2 (another guy at the party) so we decided to play around a bit. we went into @PERSON1 garage and found his @NUM2 and brake fluid. we sprayed it on the fire and i think my face got a little sunburned after that. The flames had gotten so close to my face that i could feel my eyelashes burning on the tips. Then we grabbed some more wood and dropped it on the fire. everybody came back outside to play around with it. i know I'm kind of a bad influence but when life gives you an opportunity to do something fun, you can't pass it up. We spent the rest of the night talking about girls and cracking jokes. I just wish we had a @CAPS4-@CAPS5-@CAPS6. That night, i made some eternal friends.	16	20	36
21475	8	" Do you remember the first day of @NUM1 grade? Everyone is awkwardly and excitedly standing there waiting for their seating arrangement. You have the middle school jidders and everything is just happening to fast, I remember all that. I went to school at @CAPS1 for my middle school years, my teacher was @PERSON3. She was the type of teacher that was strict when it came to where you sat in class. If you didn't like someone, she would probably sit you by them thinking that you two would magically become friends. I was standing there in the corner with my best friend @CAPS2, we were of course hoping that we would be seated next to each other. After we finally got our seating arrangements, we were not seated together. I was sat next to @PERSON4-- a girl that I didn't know at all-- @PERSON5, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. I was friends with everyone except @PERSON4, who I have never saw before in my life. As class went on @PERSON6 talked about middle school and how it is so important to get good grades and be prepared for high school, we all sat there and as to what it looked liked day dreamed. No one really talked to anyone, there was still that awkward first day thing going on. @PERSON4 looked like a girl that would rip your head off if you said anything to her, so I kept my mouth shut.  @PERSON6 went on with her ""first day lecture"" and all of a sudden she cracked a joke in the middle of her speech, to get our attention. We all started laughing. I would have to say that it was a very good ice breaker. After everyone after everyone laughed for a while, it seemed like everyone loosened up a bit. @PERSON4 and I started talking about how that joke was only funny because it was so dang stupid. From then on we kept talking and she seemed like a cool person. @PERSON4 and I became partners for every project that we did and we were always together, she became my best friend after @NUM2 days; all because of laughter. I would have to say that the reason @PERSON4 and I became friends is because of laughter. I probably never would have talked to her in the first place; even though I am glad I did because now I have an awesome best friend! Middle school can be scary, excpecially on the first day of school. That's why I think laughter is such an important part in someones relationship, you can't get by without it! "	20	20	40

Like when someone's upset, @CAPS2 just a have a good laugh and make yourself feel better. Ok I know I crack a few jokes here and there, @CAPS2 what i like to laugh alot it feels good, it makes me happy, and other people happy. I'm in foster care and i can't get out @CAPS2 laughter is an important part to my life at the moment. Even if I'm down it makes me happy to hear some one else having a good time.I miss hearing my parents laugh.My mom was an amazing mother, she had a funny laugh that would get me to grine, smile and just bust out laughing. We always had a good time, I remember when my mom took her meds @TIME1 and the pills make her a little hiper. @CAPS2 my own mother wanted to box me.@CAPS2 i had boxing gloves and she just had her fists, @CAPS3 my mom knew how to fight and every thing. @CAPS2 that experionce was a little scary. Ok enough @CAPS5 my mom, @CAPS4 my dad he was an exepttional man and father.He worked hard to support me and my brother. When my brother and I were younger my dad would always put on funny masks and do funny things to get me and my brother to laugh. Or he would put on a scary mask and scare us tp have himself a laugh.My father would go roller blading with us and try and trip us but he couldnt always keep up and if you got going to fast his legs would wobble and he would fall and me and my friends would just laugh.Every my parents past me and my family has been seperated and it sucks but laughter to me is there world right @CAPS4. I could have been my fathers twin, think hard @CAPS5 that.What Laughter Is All @CAPS5 ''Laughter Is The Shortest Distance Between Two People''. And ''I @CAPS6 Believe Laughter Between Two Or @CAPS7 People Is An Important Part Of Any @CAPS8 Of @CAPS9.''	15	15	30
21484	8	" I rested my back on the cool steel of the lockers trying to ease my nerves. ""@CAPS1 game is everything we have worked for- every excruciating practice, every tedious drill, and every game film we have studied down to the minutia. It was all to prepare us for tonight. @CAPS7 we lose tonight, everything we have worked was for nothing."" I listened attentively as @PERSON1, our team captain, spoke. The words she chose for our pre-game speech were straight to the point, and anything but sugar coated. As I glanced around the locker room it was easy to observe that everyone one of my teammates was anxious. Emilie was vigorously chewing what was left of her nails, while @LOCATION1 preferred to show her uneasiness by the constant tapping of her foot. @PERSON1 finished her speech, and with the break of our huddle we entered the gymnasium. The stands were packed with familiar faces of our small town. In a small section of the stands there was a group of people wearing colors not native to our school. @CAPS1 brutal reminder brought my attention back to warm ups.  The twenty minutes we had for warm ups seemed to last no longer than two minutes. The announcer began to state our starting line up, but it was no use. The roar of the crowd overpowered the speaker system. It seemed as @CAPS7 everyone from our town of five thousand was attending the game. Not an empty space was left in the bleachers. The bench vibrated from the stomping and clapping of the crowd, threatening with every shake to collapse. The starting five for each team walked out to the center of the court for tip off. With the loss of the tip off our team was quickly put under pressure. From the first possession of the game we were chasing our opponent.  The first two quarters ended with a dead even score. Feeling discouraged my team regrouped in the locker room for @DATE2 time. We entered the locker room a moment before my @CAPS3. I took @CAPS1 opportunity to @CAPS2 around at the expressions' of my teammates. Nothing, but disappointment and fear crossed their face's. My @CAPS3 opened the door, and I instinctively braced myself for the throwing of keys against the wall, or the smash of the clip board. My team had witnessed these acts of rage countless times before. To my surprise, my @CAPS3 entered with complete poise and composure, as @CAPS7 our first @DATE2 of treacherous play didn't phase him. We were not yelled at, or criticized. Instead, he rubbed his eyes, face down and shoulders hunched over. His belly began to shake, shortly followed by his shoulders. My first hypothesis was that he was crying, but then to my amazement, I heard the soft chuckle of our @CAPS3. Soon that soft chuckle metamorphosised into a stomach thrusting, loud cackle. My team exchanged confused glances, and waited for my @CAPS3's explanation in anticipation.  ""@CAPS2 at yourself!"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ordered. ""@CAPS5 are all more tentative than when I asked @PERSON2 out to my first dance!"" We could always rely on @CAPS3 for an unrelated metaphor. Even @CAPS7 it wasn't related to basketball, the point was clear. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS5 guys would just believe in yourself the way I believe in @CAPS5, @CAPS1 game would be a blow out! Instead, @CAPS5 are playing like a bunch of bunny foo-foos!"" We all laughed with the thought of playing like the nursery rhyme we had hear so frequently when we were children. The speech @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gave eased us all. The confident team we should have been from the start of the match was now prepared to win the @DATE2. To think that @CAPS1 confidence came from just one comforting laugh seemed almost improbable.  The whistle blew to start the @DATE2. We played with such assertiveness and confidence that @CAPS7 @CAPS5 were to compare one @DATE2 with the other, it would @CAPS2 like two different teams. We grasped the lead early in the @DATE1, and sustained it for the rest of the game. The victory of that night's game lead us one round deeper into the state tournament. As I walked back to the locker room I glanced around the massive gym. I looked at: the crowd, score board, opponents, referees and news reporters. I realized how easy it is to get caught up everything that shouldn't effect @CAPS5. All the distractions easily make @CAPS5 forget the main purpose of why @CAPS5 play the game. Occasionally we need reminders, like the calming laugh of @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Without that reassuring laugh, my team never would have united, and defeated our opponent."	25	25	50
21500	8	" Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS14 always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS11 together we @CAPS11 constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS11 you doing today?"" @ORGANIZATION1 asked. ""@CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied ""@CAPS3 i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?"" @ORGANIZATION1 said in an upset tone. ""@CAPS4. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS14 looked that @CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS3 that day was the day. @CAPS5 dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""@CAPS1 is going on in here?"" @CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. ""@CAPS8 dad."" We said still laughing. ""@CAPS9 then."" @CAPS7 replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION1 fell off of her bed. ""@CAPS11 you @CAPS9!"" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS13 you knew @ORGANIZATION1 you would know that once @CAPS14 gets going @CAPS14 thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS14 lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION1 and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION1 screamed, ""@CAPS12 on my finger!"" @CAPS13 you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS2 be disgusted but when @CAPS14 screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS14 picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS14 started to paint my nails. ""@ORGANIZATION1 it looks like i have @CAPS12 on my finger!"" I said in a loud voice. ""I think it looks very nice."" @CAPS14 replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS11 lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life."	17	20	37
21503	8	" On a hot @DATE3 day during the middle of @DATE1 and I were having a blast camping in @LOCATION2. @PERSON1 and her family took me along on their camping trip we stayed in their @CAPS1, our campsite was right by the ocean so we would go on daily walks there. We stayed in @LOCATION2 for a week. During that week, i believe on @DATE2 her older sister went into labor she lives in @LOCATION1 which is a pretty long drive from @LOCATION2. That morning @PERSON1's mom and dad woke us up very early in the morning around six thirty A.M, @PERSON1 and i had stayed up @TIME1 before until about three thirty in the morning so we were pretty tired at that point. We found out that we were going to take a little plane from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4 airport and we got it fairly cheap because @PERSON1's brother works there. Sense we knew we had a long day ahead of us on only about three hours of sleep we both drank very strong coffee to keep us going. Then we were off to the airport the whole way there we were laughing about everything street signs, names of buildings, funny looking birds, songs, also we have @CAPS2 accents that we say every word with so it was that much funnier. My stomach muscles hurt so bad i don't know if we were laughing because things were actually funny or if we were delirious from not having much sleep and on top of that on a caffeine high and sugar rush. Once we got to the actual airport we still could not stop laughing @PERSON1's parents were getting frustrated with us even though we were making them crack up also. We all boarded the plane and we sat next to each other of course. We swear still to this day that we had a secret agent sitting behind us he had on spy glasses, a suit and an ear piece @CAPS3 the secret agents wear that protect the president we kept making up stories about what he does we couldn't stop laughing. Finally he started to talk to us. We were very enthused he was telling us all the places he was going the place I remember the most is @LOCATION3 a secret agent! We knew it at this point. We thought how awesome of a job! Of course @PERSON1's parents interrupted ""I'm sorry sir, are they bothering you?"" @CAPS3 we were some kind of pest, he replied ""of course not, i have nothing better to do."" We even had him laughing so hard that he was crying i guess you could say we are pretty funny when we are together. The best part was when her mom was having anxiety about flying i mean its not funny but she mad it funny because she was saying things such as ""oh my goodness were gonna crash, girls be quiet your freaking me out"" etc. @PERSON1 and I took advantage of the situation and made her even more scared. finally we landed. At the airport we went to the restroom and there was free toothbrushes so we took some @PERSON1 took a green one and I took a pink one. we used them all day in pictures and everything. Then we got a rental car and went to the hospital still laughing about everything we got into the hospital and finally seen the baby she was so cute. We started to settle down once we were in the room. After about an hour we went out to eat we were all so hungry. We ate then had to sit around and waste three hours we went to the mall then to @PERSON1's family's house we crashed! @PERSON1 and I were dead! but we still had the flight home, dreading every step we didn't know how we were going to make it. Finally we got on the plane went back to camp and went to sleep. It was one of those ""had to be there"" days i cant put the emotion and laughter into words it was that funny. We are best friends for a reason were definitely not boring which i think keeps us so close."	17	15	32
21506	8	"  I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON1. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, ""@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS5 will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""""@CAPS7"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.   "	25	20	45
21509	8	So one day I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So go check my email, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I got excited to talk to him becuase I got my phone taken away. I open it, and it was a break up email. It was so shocking. I wanted to cry. So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON1 and tolled her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON1 said yes to comeing over! @PERSON1 is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do, and say when I'm upset. I was waiting for her for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she out doing things. She finally gets to my house, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for one a other. I have always been there when all of @CAPS1 boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as any boyfriends as she had. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river fellowing down my face. Being dumped really is a horriable feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so the he dmped me was very unlike him. @PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was think why are you just texting you should comforting me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So started to talk and we desided to go to the mall. Thats always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She just got home. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere was better any home at that time. So we went back to my room, I was crying again. So @PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew the things weren't true, but it was really really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @PERSON1 making up stupid ex-boyfriend jokes! Laughter is the best way to make everthing better!	15	15	30
21513	8	"                       Laughter   @CAPS1 is like a drug that works better than any other painkiller, or anti-depressant out there. It makes angry people happy, and happy people ecstatic. One of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS10's your favorite comedy I say ""@CAPS2 with @PERSON1"". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years young; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE1 and just have fun. It was any ordinary boring day @CAPS7 school and I remember walking home hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS3, I asked him @CAPS10 he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother, I asked @CAPS10 he was watching a second time, he let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" was about to start. Within the first five minutes we were already @CAPS1, not just giggling or slightly chuckling, tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS1. I remember saying to my brother ""@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!"" @CAPS7 the end of the movie my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @NUM2 seconds we'd quote it, it was non stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS10 was on next wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched, and sure enough after the commercial break we learned that it was a @PERSON1 marathon, and on next was ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something completely idiotic, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS7 some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS6 guy, my brother was rolling on the floor @CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @CAPS10 happened next. About half way through the movie my mom got home from work, she walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics, she said ""@CAPS10's so funny?"" We just pointed @CAPS7 the @CAPS3 right as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon enough our mom was watching it too, @CAPS1 just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family, @CAPS10 more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON1 movie? On next was a movie called ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14"", completely ridiculous, and completely hilarious, @CAPS10's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, we inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we slept @CAPS7 all after @CAPS1 all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @CAPS2 funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made our stomachs ache, and through it all it brought my brother and I closer. To @CAPS6 day my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we have watched them before and all the laughs we shared, I swear half of my childhood consisted of @CAPS1, and @PERCENT1 of that @CAPS1 came from those movies. The movies helped me to develop a funny personality, they shaped @CAPS10 I think is humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love, that laughter is an important aspect in our lives, without it life would be plain and dull like a meaningless blob of clay. Have you ever gone a day without @CAPS1? If so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you're mad or upset the best way to cure your anger or frustration is by having a good laugh.     "	18	19	37
21535	8	" You know when you're talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time @DATE1 when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think its so funny that you laugh so hard you cry? I remember days like those, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out laughter is usually involved. To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny. Laughter brings people together even on the worst days.  Everyone has those awkward times when you're talking to someone who you aren't having the best of relationship with but yet you have to make due and try to make it less awkward. There's also the random joke when someones upset to try to lighten the mood. When you get someone to laugh its so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and its easier to talk with less tension. I've had plenty of days when I've gotten into a fight with a friend and I've had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or if they are judging you as you speak. But you know they aren't when you can get them to laugh because then they aren't really thinking badly of you. It also helps the tension. There's also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you. Sure there's still tension cause of the fact that they are crying but joking about it or trying to get them to smile or laugh does help distract them and get them in a better mood. It's said that ""Laughter is the shortest distant between two people."" and I think that's true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you. Also if you can have a good laugh with someone they are more likely to become a friend of yours since you know how to make them laugh and it's fun to talk to you. The more you and a friend can joke and laugh together the more close you usually tend to get with them cause you enjoy spending time with them and you're more comfortable with them and you know them better. And also when you can joke freely with someone you can usually also talk freely to them about anything and you know they'll be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to. I know that I personally love to hear funny stories, I never really have many of my own that I remember. I love hearing jokes and laughing with my friends. It always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know. But most people tend to giggle or smile when uncomfortable too. You know those times when someones having an awkward conversation with you and they ask a question you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you cam do is giggle and smile when they look at you expecting to answer. Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you just laugh and keep messing up your sentences cause you don't want to mess up. I don't know if laughing when you're uncomfortable is just a way to make it less awkward or because you're too confused on what else to do. Sometimes when you get awkward and laugh it can make it even more awkward when they just find it weird and sometimes it helps when they then joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward.  Even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry. It is also said that's ""Laughter is the greatest medicine."" I also agree with that because when you laugh you always tend to be in a greater mood and when you're in a better mood you tend to feel better in any way and you also tend to be more positive about things. Laughter brings people together in awkward, sad, good, or just normal conversations. The better you can relate to someone, the more you guys can joke together, the more comfortable you are with that person. Your day is always brightened when you share a good laugh with a friend, a classmate, a parent, anyone, even a stranger. It always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days."	20	15	35
21539	8	"@CAPS1 as long as you breathe, love as long as you live. @CAPS2 was impossible, there was absolutely no way @CAPS2 could be real. Breathing seemed virtually unachievable, as if I was choking on air. Everything around me blurred, spinning viciously as I clung to the fresh cut grass. Tears diluted the burn in my eyes, but not the sting in my nose, though neither caused my body to tremble as @CAPS2 did. Attempted screams came out as muffled moans. Alone @CAPS8 helpless, I could feel her staring at me, unsure of what to @CAPS7. My best friend stood @CAPS8 watched as I grew more violent, pounding the dew soaked lawn with my fists, whimpers transforming into shrieks. A door slammed behind me @CAPS8 I felt the arms of my father, trying to guide me towards the house. Once inside, my dad buried my face in his chest in more of an attempt to silence my obnoxious wailing rather than comfort me. He apologized repeatedly, I imagine he didn't know what else to @CAPS7. @CAPS2 was too early for the In a better place"" speech, but too late for everything to be okay. I continued to cry as stumbled up the stairs to my bedroom, @PERSON2 trailing close behind. Sitting on my bed @CAPS2 seemed like nothing was worse in the world. Suddenly, I was over-whelmed by the feeling I was missing something, like he was closer than I knew. I sat up to see his plastic sunglasses sat staring at me from my dresser. A black frame with neon blue sides. He @CAPS8 his ""stunna-shades"" danced through my head. Him standing out the car sunroof flexing shirtless, to propping himself up pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face held grief @CAPS8 frustration, he didn't want me crying. The few times tears fell down my face he'd say, ""@CAPS3 on, suck @CAPS2 up @CAPS8 take @CAPS2 like a man!"" I knew in my heart he wanted me to be with the people he loved @CAPS8 he wanted us to be smiling. With the morning sun beating on my back, I pedaled my bike as fast as my legs would allow. Reaching her front porch, I realized immediately the time I was about to spend in that house, would be like none before. When I let myself in as I always did @CAPS6 peered around the corner, eyes swollen @CAPS8 discolored. I took four steps forward @CAPS8 met her with a tearful embrace, in which I apprehended @CAPS6 wished I was him. @CAPS6 loved him in a way I'd never fathomed, but the desperate longing to be held by a loved one, I knew all too well. We cried @CAPS8 held each other because there was nothing more we could @CAPS7. When there was a pause in the sobs @CAPS8 @PERSON3 actually looked at me for the first time, noticing I looked just as terrible as @CAPS6 did. I reached into my pocket @CAPS8 pulled out his sunglasses. @CAPS2 was hard not be selfish at a time where all I wanted was to be comforted, but I knew what I had to @CAPS7. Forcing a smile seemed infeasible, but I knew @CAPS2 was my next step. Her gaze drifted down to the palms of my hands. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5."" @CAPS6 started weeping once more, I held her @CAPS8 tried to be strong. More of my friends crept out of the kitchen, tear stained @CAPS8 reddened as well. I smiled at them gently. They all took notice to the sunglasses in my hand, but didn't understand, they hadn't know him the way @CAPS6 @CAPS8 I did. We spent the day gathered around with a loss of words @CAPS8 hunger, our pizza sat untouched, the television on just to break the silence. No one said much, about anything. ""@CAPS7 you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?"" I felt the question @CAPS3 up like vomit, too large to swallow. They just looked at me, not sure what to think. I feared I spoke too soon, I began to assume all of the melancholy @CAPS8 crying was supposed to continue uninterrupted for longer than @CAPS2 had. @PERSON3 smiled @CAPS8 nodded to my relief. ""@CAPS8 you got mad because he kept putting the nuts in your noodles."" I laughed aloud, I couldn't help @CAPS2. I was flooded by the memory of him trying to act confused as to why the boiling water had cashews floating on top. ""@CAPS7 you remember how he'd always braid your hair?"" @PERSON3 smiled even greater.  The rest of that month was filled to the brim with tears, but @CAPS2 overflowed with laughter. When @PERSON1 died, laughing was the last thing I wanted to @CAPS7. @PERSON1 always generated the larger portion of my laughter, @CAPS8 with him gone I never imagined I would @CAPS1 again. But in reality, just because he left too soon doesn't mean the laughter did. My beatitude in his memory will never die."""	20	25	45
21540	8	" Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM1-speed, and I only knew @CAPS1 to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON1 in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch ""@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4,"" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the ""@CAPS5"" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have ""@CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I be sad, mad, down, or in this case, not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and this is the first time in my life I've felt truly energized. Laughter was a huge part."	20	25	45
21544	8	 I choose to have a positive out look on life and I'm generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life mad all the time? Even at my lowest I know that I have a lot to be thankful for. Because of this, laughter is an every day factor of my life. When I'm with friends and family I am always laughing. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl with out it. When I was in the fourth grade my family and I began going to a new @CAPS3 I didn't know any one there and I was really nervous about going to @DATE1 @TIME1. Mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. Her name was @PERSON1. She was pretty and very tall with a funny australian accent. She was wearing alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Ms. @PERSON1 introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. after taking my seat we recited @CAPS1 versus and read short clips of @CAPS2 stories. When @CAPS3 had ended mom came downstairs to gt me. Reculctant as I was to see her I took hold of her hand, said bye to @PERSON1,and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids, but on our way upstairs a girl about my age, from which i recognized from the class said goodbye to me. I returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. One week later mom took me downstairs to @ORGANIZATION1. This time I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was @PERSON2. We soon became very close. Every week I was so excited for @CAPS3 so I could spend time with @ORGANIZATION2. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team together and we pretty much live at one anothers houses. In fact @PERSON2 has her own toothbrush at my house and I have one at her house as well. One time @PERSON2 and I were in @CAPS3, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! @PERSON2 and I have so many great memories together and though we are becoming older the memories will last forever.	15	16	31
21557	8	" Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  ""@CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" @CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter."	18	25	42
21569	8	 It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so i picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another movie that i cant remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4. The movie stars @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS4 @LOCATION1; @LOCATION1 plays an important part on the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night.   Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON1 came across a native fellow named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION1 is very grateful and is @CAPS11 guide around the mysterious @CAPS3 that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man.  Back to what i was talking abot earlier, when @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 end up in the cave the see two full body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life. To this day i look back at it and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw the movie.  About a month later, I went over to one of my good friends houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard.  Laughter is good for the soul and moral, and for friendship building. Thank the @CAPS14 that he made us laugh!	18	16	34
21575	8	 To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter @MONTH1 some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as @CAPS1 someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when @CAPS2 hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle @CAPS2 not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to. @CAPS2 shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy @CAPS4 of us. I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset. And when someone asks him what Is wrong or @CAPS1 he Is okay @CAPS2 seems that he just gets more angry. So me being one of his closer friends I try and help him with that, and so far @CAPS2 has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being In a better mood @CAPS2 makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. @CAPS1 I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter. Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that @CAPS2 brings people closer, so use @CAPS2 don't be afraid.	15	15	30
21577	8	" Laughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people closer, connecting them between something they have in common forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them laughter is the glue that holds together any relationship and keeps a person from breaking into tears when something wrong happens. In fact without laughter I probably would not even get through my day to day school life. Without laughter one class in particular would be a nightmare.  In @ORGANIZATION1 we are dissecting cats and we are working with a partner, if I was not making jokes and laughing while I worked, my partner and I would have hated each other. We got to choose our partner and work at a lab station with another pair of students, fortunately for me I knew all of the people I was working near and with, and I was friends with all of them. we had to wear gloves and suits so we didn't get fluids or ""cat juices"" on us. First, we had to skin the cat, of course there is more than one way to do this, you can cut, slice, rip, and pull to remove the skin. Then we had to view and identify the muscles this was especially hard because we could not tell where one muscle begins and another ends. Next we had to remove the muscles and identify the bones and digestive organs. After we identified the bones and digestive organs, we had to remove them and view the stomach, liver, intestines, and kidneys. We had to cut open the stomach, intestines, and kidneys to look at the structure of them. lastly, we had to remove the heart and lungs. The class was told we are doing dissections for about a month and it has only been three weeks. You can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much I need laughter to keep myself together and from going insane. My friends keep me from breaking into tears and keep me laughing.  Dissecting cats in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was challenging not only physically, but mentally challenging as well. It stressful, fascinating, and gross, and without the jokes and the laughter I do not think I would have never made it through it. My friends support there when I needed it guided me through the terrible assignment. So as you can clearly see, without laughter I would not be able to do some of the day to day things I do at school."	18	20	40
21603	8	" Those eyes, it was like I was looking out into a warm carribean sunset with a flash of green while relaxing on the beach without a care in the world. Her skin was kissed by the sun and flawless in every way. Those lushes ruby red lips looed about as juicy and refreshing as the taste of a freshly picked pink lady apple. From the moment she sat down across from me i couldve sworn i was dreamin. How can any woman look so perfect and exist outside of a movie or game? Thats all i could think of, thats all i wanted to imagine. Just me and her together, but the thought of it was to great to come true I couldnt find a way to bridge this gap i felt between us. Neither of us had ever met or seen each other before and yet still i couldnt resist. it was like when adam was presented with the golden apple from eve. That smile, perfectly straight teeth with that sparkling shine that could blind anyone without sunglasses. Thats when she inally spoke and said ""@CAPS1 you know the answer to number three?"". I was stunned by her voice. It reminded me of a thousend violins played by angels. my mouth droped and all I could say was ""nope"". I was a complete mook nothing more then a hoser, but then i noticed she was wearing a cross to match her outfit. So I attempted to redeem myself with ""thats an amzing cross ur wearing, what kind of gem is that in the cnter?"". She smiled and batted her eyelashes and told me ""thank you, I like your cross too. mine has a ruby in it"". I smiled back then i got a text message from my friend wth a new joke he wanted me to hear. As I read it I started to burst out laughing. The angel in front of me was then curiouse to what I was laughing about. When i finally finished the joke she too bursted out laughing and I finally gave myself a proper intruduction and told her my name. She was smiling fom ear to ear after the laugh we sared and she told me her name was ""@CAPS2"". Ah @CAPS2 surly it had to be a name given to angels. To this day I still thank my friend who gave me that joke, because if I had not made her laugh then we probably wouldnt have gotten to know each other. If we had not gotten to know each other then she probably wouldnt be my girlfriend. To this day I still feel like the luckiest man in the world and if fate see's fit to split us apart then I will always remember that laughing is the best way to get to know someone."	17	18	35
21618	8	" A while back my mom had decided to send me to @DATE3 camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, @CAPS1 I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly @CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of @CAPS2. Playing @CAPS2 at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing @CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play @CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE1 we played the silly little game of @CAPS2, and just giggled and laughed. @DATE2 came along the second @DATE1 of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing @CAPS2. We played it so much the first @DATE1 that we just called it ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2"" instead of @CAPS2. Like other things we got tired of @CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE1 was so boring so we played @CAPS2 again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the @DATE1 all of us really became friends.  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the @DATE1. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all @DATE1 missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @DATE4 the @DATE1 of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the @DATE1 @DATE1 of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When @DATE1 time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost @TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, @CAPS1 we where leaving in the @TIME2. There was one @DATE1 thing we had to do, and it was one @DATE1 game of @CAPS2. We played for about in hour, @CAPS1 another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play @CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, @CAPS1 we all became friends by just playing @CAPS2 and laughing together."	20	19	40
