17	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I belive that computers have a negative effect on peoples lives. I belive this because who spend to much time on the computer don't get out as much as they should, don't spend enough time with their family, and the computer can't do everything. My first reason is I belive that people need to get out more. When they don't get out, they don't exersise and that is very unhealthy. Instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game. I also belive that they should enjoy nature because I feel like they are wasting the beauty of nature all around them. We wouldn't want to waste our abilities and privalges would we? Another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family. If you have family near you, then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another. You can have fun with your family by playing games. You can also have fun by just hanging out, which boost your social skills and the computer can't always do that, which brings me to my next point. The computer can't do everything, so take advantage of what you have now. Some computer time is fine, but it can be very dangerous by getting addictted to it. The computer @MONTH1 have lots of information, but there is nothing that you can't find in a book. Your computer can't love your dog, so there is a reason why we should get off the computer. There are pleanty of other things that you can do that you can't do on the computer, including sports, taking care of family, and any of your hobbys. Remember that the computer @MONTH1 be great from time to time, but it can not live your life for you. That is why I belive that we should spend less time on the computer, and more time getting out, and having fun with family, and that the the computer can't do everything.	4	4	8
22	1	Dear local Newspaper @CAPS1 a take all your computer and given to the people around the world for the can stay in their houses chating with their family and friend. Computers help people around the world to connect with other people computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world.	2	1	3
46	1	Dear, Local Newspaper @CAPS1 here to inform you that the time we spend on computers is needed because it helps you with information, it helps you to become smarter and it helps you with hand-eye coordination. I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason. My first reason I'll like to state that will convince you with the time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us with information and it teaches stuff about place's, people, culture and more it teaches us useful information which takes a while to learn so the time we spend on computeres is needed to learn new information. My second reason I'll like to state that will convince you with. The time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us to become smarter. Say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it. Computers make you become become smarter. And at the end of the day it's about who's smarter not who does more excerise. My third and final reason which contribute to why we spend the time we spend on computer are needed because it teaches you good hand-eye coordination because it help with typing and become more faster to do essay's and when you have good hand-eye coordination you dont make a lot of mistake's typing. So I have come to my conclusion why a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information, you become smarter, and it teaches good hand-eye coordination this is why a lot of computer time is needed probably even more computer time is needed. A lot of computer time is needed because you get smarter plus it beneifts society.	4	4	8
47	1	Dear newspaper, I feel as though internet or computers act as an advantage in sosiety rather than a problem. They help with school work, like projects or email. You can even take college online now! People also use the internet for media or to simply catch up with friends. One of the most important reasons to have a computer is for school orenented reasons. Like having a project that you need to get notes for or making a power poin presentation. One other great reson is for the teachers. There computers can help them teach a class in a way that is both fun and easy to undersand. The new uprizing in computer use has brought about new ways of getting a college degree. Now you even just simply get in bed turn on your lap top and take college classes right on your computer! I dont know about you guy's but I'd much rather take college in the own comfort of my home then drive to a campus all the time. Another great use for the internet is e-mail to e-mail makes our lives a lot easier now that more people use it. It can send us school starts like a early dismiste or a way to catch up with old highschool frends. Another great reson for the internet is for mention or just to have fun and relax. @PERCENT1 of people that have computers use them for media or fun reasons, like gamelry, or to go on to youtube. Please add this article into your news paper so that the computer can be put out there as a helping add, and not something that is going to make the whole world obise because thats not just from computers. Its the people who use computers, felt that they dont get exercise not the computers. So why put them out in a bad way.	4	4	8
63	1	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They are good because you can learn things educational. You can hear the latest stories on everything, and you can keep your information down for yourself. Computers are a good thing to have because you can learn information. @CAPS1 you have a question or don't know what something means, you can find out on the internet. These are some internet sources that are @NUM1 to answer questions. @CAPS1 we didnt have computers, then @CAPS1 you have a question, then you would have to go find a book to read in and that takes much more work. Another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories. You can learn about whats happenings in other parts of the world, you can learn things about celebrities, and you can look at the weather. You can find all this cut on television, but you never knows when it would come on. With computers, you can search all the latest stories and find things cut when you want to know them. With Computers, you can also keep information down. You could use @ORGANIZATION1 and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashion. You can also make graphs on the computer. This way your graphs will nice have alright time and @CAPS1 you would to go information that in a @CAPS1 there were no computers then your information would not be as and you can it. I believe that computers are a good thing to have because you can hear about the latest stories, and you can keep your own information neat. I believe computers positive effect in people.	4	4	8
68	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but they are also too dependent on. Man-kind should use books for research also not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills. It's much faster and much easier than paying ""manually"". These are some really good effects that computers have on people. Computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy. Some people have become too dependant on their computers. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are @CAPS2 on their laplops or blackberries. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e-mail. Not only adult's do this though. Students are becoming more dependant on the internet. For every assignment practically, students use google or bing. Sometimes they use or wikipedia. Students should just take the time to use their extbooks. The student body would rather watch @CAPS3, play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end. Taking the extra @NUM1 minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you. Making purchases is fun though. It saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view."	5	4	9
72	1	"Hello, I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. Comuters are powerful machines, and can be used completing otherwise menial and boring tasks. They benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in buissness, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. Computers are uselful in buissness and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers. One reason Computers are so useful in the workplace is because computers can storee far more data that can be put on paper. Also, they can do jobs and processes very quickly, which is important in the workplace. They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble. These are all valid reasons comuters are beneficial in buissness, and help things get done. Computers are important today's schools and educational programs becasue they can help students work in a more efficient fashion. ""@PERCENT1 of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write on by hand, and shows that they value them in their education."" said @PERSON2, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1. This shows that Computers are important to students, and are used their benefit. In addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading, attendance records, and more. The teachers at my school are using @CAPS1 @CAPS2, pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers, and can be used instead of white @CAPS2, and I see that students are getting more involved in class, and focused, because this computer technology is being used. All of these @CAPS3 are reasons computers are helpful in educational proceeses, and should continue to be used. Many people want to be able talk to there friends and family when they are bored, and because of computers and social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this is made much easier. ""@PERCENT2 of teens have at least one sacial networking site they visit on a regular basis."" said @PERSON1, a phycologist, who speciaizes in teens, This shows that people use these sites, and that they like them. Families that are separated because one @MONTH1 have moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another, and because of computers, they can. There are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before. Being able to communicate with one another makes theses people happy, and benefits society. Overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. To conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. Whether it's through helping buissnesses being more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster, and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. These machines hardly ever slow people more thant manually doing the work would, and the positive influence they have far outweighs the bad they do."	5	5	10
76	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, ""@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people threw the internet."" @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than @NUM3 miles away from you? If you do, @CAPS2 a computer will solve your problem of communication. @CAPS1 friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, ""I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in @CAPS1 essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with @CAPS1 family."" I didn't want to tell you this, but i was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and i learned just like @LOCATION2 learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated."	4	4	8
86	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 computers become more and more a part of everyday life people begin to question wether or not they have a positive impact on people. Computers are a technological wonder that has a positive effect on people. The world wide web, unlimited socialization and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers. The internet provides acess to the world wide we. Infinite amounts of information can be found on your computer. ""@CAPS2 in almost everyday school rely on the internet to gain information stated education secretary, @PERSON1. Also search engines provide acess to thousands of information loaded pages. In addition to unlimited information the web olds thousands of different web pages. With these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games. The web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers. Socialization is a huge of the moders life style. Web cames @CAPS1 on computers allow people to talk with friends who live miles away. No longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world. Also, instant messaging and email is the main comunication system for thousands of people. It is the most efficient way to talk to friends. In fact, I became re connected with a lot of people I didn't talked to in a long time by getting email. Every body loves taking with their friends and family and this is made easier by using computers. Simulations are a huge benifit of computers. Many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives. Many proffessions using simulations on computers to help learn hot to do their job nine out of ten medical schools have the use of surgery simulations @CAPS1 part of their training course. Also, simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people. I myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical themed computer games. Also many games and computer simulation have helped many people learn new things, @CAPS3 are countless learning games and simulations that are acessable by computer. Simulations add huge benifets to owning a computer. @CAPS1 technology advances people are opened up to many possibilities suck @CAPS1 information via the web unlimited socialization and simulations. The benifits of computers are many and the problems few. So, how can you keep up in a world where computer users hold the advantage if you deny the benifits of computers? Computers affect people in a positive way."	4	4	8
91	1	Dear Newspaper, I think computers are great. There really helpful. They can teach us about things. Also they have fun games and websites which is always a plus. Computers are helpful in lots of things, like if you need to look something up for school you can just easily go on the computer and find it also some teachers have websites now where insted of bringing a big social studies book home, you can go on the internet and use the online book. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 students rather use the internet book then taking the actual one home. Also if you forgot to write down your homework theres a website to lookup all the homework you have. Also computers can teach us things. There are websites that have math games and school related things. Also you can easilly go on google and look up things and they can give you thousands of information. Lastly the internet is a good source for fun they have millions of games on the internet and also fun websites like facebook. Did you know @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 students use the computer for the games and online talking. This also gives kids lots of things to do on a rainy day. So weither your using the internet for it's helpfulness its resources, or just for the fun games and websites. Computers are really helpful.	4	4	8
97	1	Dear Local @CAPS1, I think computers benefit society greaty. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is comunication. If you're in @LOCATION1 on a buisnoss trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an emil which is much less expensive than paying for as piece of @CAPS1. The experts concerns that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a point. Many people cominucate with family and friends through computers. I would hardely yet to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on facebook. I would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on @CAPS2. If the concern is face to face contact, the computer has a cure for that, too, a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow comunication is through the shareing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the @CAPS3, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 about crime stats. Many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple reasearch project could take for months. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching youtube for hours is not nessasarily the best thing. However, the @CAPS4 is also for computer. The @CAPS4 has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting excersize. Computers are like chocolate. They can be good, but too much is a bad thing.	4	4	8
100	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know how long you go on the computer for? Well get up and go outside. Thats one of my reasons why I think people spend to much time on it my other reason is your eyesit can go bad. Its a nice sunny day dont wast your time on the computer! Go outside! All, kids @CAPS1 is sit on the computer all day not getting exercis. Did you know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids that sit on the computers all day gain at least @NUM3? @PERSON1 told me that. I mean I believe him because its true kids dont get up.There missing a nice day out would you wanna miss a nice sunny day? My finall reason is kids eyesight can go bad. I mean having them stare at a screen all day, thats bad. @PERSON1 told me if your on the computer for @NUM4 hours on the computer for @NUM4 hours straight your eyes can get worst. I remember a tiny when I was on the computer for @NUM4 1/@NUM4 hours my eyes were killing me everything I blink. I know the computer is fun playing games, talking to friends but you should take a break and @CAPS1 something ples. In conclusion just go outside and have fun! @CAPS1 you want to wast a nice sunny day by staying in doors hurting your eyes? I know I @CAPS1!	3	4	7
116	1	I agree with the newspaper, people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising. everyone knows computers addictive. but people need to get out more. but people making it more addicting by creating things such as never ending games and its distracting people from there life, family, work and exercise.	2	2	4
121	1	Do you think computers are helpful? Well you should because, They are the most help full object on the market, also @CAPS8 famly members live far away you can im, facebook them or even send @CAPS1 and to them. The main thing for tenes or chidren is easly the enjoyment you could watch your favort showes with a click of the mouse or even play freefun games.

Doing @CAPS8 when @CAPS8 was easy you will also get a better grade. @CAPS4 a big famly trip is coming up you can go online and get the trip easer then you would have , and at low price.

Know you know why the internet is great @CAPS8 has games be close to your famly or even @CAPS9 get help. So chus to say you think the internet is good its your dicision.	4	4	8
138	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been a lot of discusion of whether computers effect people in a positive way or in a negative way. I believe that computers effect most people negatively. I think this because people lose their people skills"" by talking through the computer, computers @MONTH1 also lead to danger, and because people tend to forget about their priorities in life. From what i know. most people that use computers use them to talk to friends and other people around the world. Instead of hangingout with their friends they talk through the computer and if that what they do, more than hanging in person then they won't reconize the facial expressions given to them by certin people, while talking in person you get the full on experience of communicating with them. You get the tome of voide in addition to the facial expressions. You also get the body language which you can't get from on the computer unless you are using webcam. Computers have led to many dangers. These dangers effect every user and their families. @CAPS1 have been many cases of young teenagers being tricked by ader users into showing them parts of their body to making the teens believe that the older user can relate to their problems and are the same age. sometime the teen is persuade to leave their home and neighbor hood to meet the other user. Also, another type of danger is cyberbulling. Cybe bulles lower yourself-esteem. The bullies call you names and pick on you and sometimes make you feel suicidal. If we hadnt had any computer then none of these dangers would be occuring. With computers people have lost their judgement in top priorites. Some computers uses tend to forget about the important things in life such as family, schools work, and their own health. Some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends. Others tend to choose not to do their homework and work on their social life on the computer instead. Since they are on the computer alot they seem to ignore their health. They don't exercise as much and don't eat as healthy. So in my opinion, life without computers would be good for everyone. People would still have the people skills they had before, their wouldn't be as much danger, and people would focus more on the important thins than their online social lives."""	4	6	10
146	1	Dear local newspaper I think that usieng computers help people becuse if we did not have computers we would not now ehey thing about eneyone or eneything like all of the @CAPS1 I would not now eneything about them but with computers I know alot about them and there lives like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 got shot in the back of the head and. @CAPS4 got shot to and I know alot about the @ORGANIZATION1 there white people that to fear in to black people and the same with the wars like world @NUM1 and world @NUM2 and the @CAPS5 and @PERSON1 and the @CAPS6 war there was like plain spy palin flying across @LOCATION1 and they shot him down becuse we were trying to see if thay had eney nuculer bombs offer there. And the same with google and yahoo with google you can type in eneything and you will get a answer and most liked a corect answer yahoo and google is great for some worke and products end studying becuse you then you do to and that I think that computer are good.	3	3	6
154	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. It helps people learn new things about different cultures. Also, it lets you communicate with friends and family through the internet, for example, using facebook or @CAPS1. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. For example, here, we learn @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. However, some people don't have the chance to get this land of education, so they turn to the internet. If the computer didn't exist, we might not know about the lifestyle @NUM1 mi away from us. We wouldn't know if their lifestyles are extremely difficult or luxurious. Also, we wouldn't know if we could help them or not. For example, the earthquake in @LOCATION1 which. It's one step closer to world peace no more war or conflicts. Secondly, the computer helps you communicate to friends and family for in the world. I remember one time I was mailing my family friends who was in @LOCATION2, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. I don't know how I would have without the internet. Other ways lived you could as. Also, just communicating with friends! internet sites, like extremely useful. Finally, you use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever that a research is the internet. This extremely reliable and accurate. However that some of the websites are fake, which is easy to great research to use for school projects. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their @CAPS4 on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her go to help use study. Also, is another website that helps us study for vocab. It also has many games that and learn our vocab words. As you can see, the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. As very successful newspaper and people, I assume you will understand how much the computer has made a positive effect in society.	6	6	12
155	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 there has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society. Some ""experts"" say computers are good for society and some think the opposite computers are bad for society because they make children obese, decrease a person social skills, and even make children less educated. Computers are just plain bad. In recent years studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active. Dr. @PERSON1 says, ""The more children use computers is the more time they waste @CAPS3 not being active at all."" A study conducted @CAPS3 the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that children that use the computer @NUM1 hours a day are more obese then children who use it one hour or less a day. Computers keep children inside all day. A child on the computer is wasting time not being active. The main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy. Computer are a direct cause to child obesity, and they are a threat to society. Some of you @MONTH1 think a computer can increase social skills, and you are dead wrong! On a computer you can ""talk"" to friends, but it is not like you are actually talking to them. On a computer you can talk in privite and say what ever the heck you want. In public if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble. A computer offers no face to face interaction. So when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward. My cousin spends all of his time on the computer and when I went to his on christmas he never took his eyes off the screen! Computers is destroying the social life millions of people. Did you know that people who use the computer often are usually less smart than kids who don't? ""Experts"" on computers say that computers can be used for infenite nolege. The key word in that fraise is ""can"". just because kids have knoledge at their finger tips doesn't mean the will use it. On many projects and homework assignments I have record kids say ""@CAPS2 I just copied and printed an article on google."" @CAPS3 copying and printing students don't learn anything. Computers are slowly making people less educated. Ever since the invention of the computer people have seen promise for society. Now computers are destroying society @CAPS3 making people fat, socialy weird, and less educated. So how can people still think computers are good?"	5	5	10
162	1	"Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place. People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly. What society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition,you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease! Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it! The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well! Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want! Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing."	6	6	12
185	1	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are many people who use computers this advanced technology we have. Lots of people life that we had computers they have lots of benefits that come with having computers. But not everyone agrees with this @CAPS2 are many people who don’t like that people use computers to much it takes away less time from enjoying nature, exerising, and interesting with family and friends. But I think on people with computer such as talking to people who you cant see, looking up information gives people something to do. One of the effects computers have on people is it allows you to talk to people you really dont see. I say this beacause not all your friends go to the same school so you dont see them as much. But they might have email, myspace, and facebook. Surf you cant online. It makes it easier to talk to them instad of driving so you can see them. I think that is @CAPS2 are activities you have to do or other activities, they need to do The second effect computers has on people it allows you to look up information. Think of it have you to do a project and you dont always have enough information on what it is to do it. But if your computer it gives lots of you can find information. I think that computer can help you in that way the endless sites of information and of better. Also the might be times go on a trip and know how much it cost and how long its going to take to set to you destination. Well if you look it upon the computer it will be all their for you to see also where else will you find this information you call to questions when consist go to the website. The third effect computers have on people are it gives you something to do. I say this because not all the time will you me to do something to do. Sometimes you will be bored something to do go on computer. The things you can do like play games. Also watch videos on youtube. For example you funny keeps you laughin add on the computer you watch videos. Another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now. See these @MONTH1 things you can go on the computer. To conclude I think that computers have lots of effects on people. These are about computer how people spend time on them. But I disagree is many good effects computers can have on people. I hope you agree with me. These are the three effects computers has on people allows you look up information, gives you something to do.	4	4	8
204	1	You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question noone in your home can answer. Why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Of course once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't @CAPS3 what to do. Simple, all you have to do is reasearch it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over @PERCENT1 of jobs out in the world relie on the technology of a computer. For example the @ORGANIZATION1 job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do? There are some lawyers incart who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying. Did you @CAPS3 that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is @CAPS4. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget @CAPS5. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be @CAPS6 @CAPS7. That game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain. Strategy come in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?	5	5	10
236	1	Dear newspaper people I think computers are good because wat if I have a family member that gose out of town and you want to stay in tuch and I dont have a phone then I can go-on a chatting web sight and stay in with them. When @CAPS1 bored I go on google to look up and pichers and play some games. You can look up one think and find something elsa, but it will cech your eyes. Computers are good were ever you go, it can look up for a project for school. Bur ween you are in school it can help you with spelling, and if u got to know wat contrey has the most people the @CAPS2 will find the ancer as fast as a snap. Computers are advanceing every year. Seart the @CAPS2 was just a screan and a mouse, now we got laptops that you can tack every were. People can get exercis if thay want and thay can enjoy nature thay can bring a laptop. But when you are exercising then you can go right to youtube and lison to some musick and wach funny videos. And thats whay I think computers are good.	3	3	6
243	1	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would life effect you if you did not have a computer? I strongly belive that computers have a great effect on people all around the world. It helps you at work for a job and at school. Computers also help students and adults talk to people. Many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is. With a computer, you can find out all of that information. Read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic. With a computer it is much easier at your job or at school. Just think, without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours. When you type a paper for school, you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct. If you write a paper by hand, there is a huge chance that some words could be spelt wrong. Work get finished a lot a quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends. If you rush on a paper, the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says, on the computer, you work is always going to be neat. You mcan e-mail your work to a friend or save it to your computer so if. you need to change something for a paper, it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over. Computers do not effect me in a horrible way because it helps 'me get my work done faster. Computers help people communicate with other people. By having a computer people can talk to other people. In many schools students ask their friend a question about homework. Without a computer, people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong. I like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans. When you are on the computer, you can go on facebook and if they are on, talk to them about what they wanted to do kthat night. It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them. Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with. Now with a computer they will have no issue doing that. You will finally be able to look up a place you want to go. Many people in this world like to travel on the computer you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place, you want to go, you will see if they easy way to get there and that might not he by car. i would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching. Now I can just go on the website and find out 'everything I wanted to know about that place. If a place is @NUM1 hours away, I would not want to travel that far so I would need to know if a place is close to where I live computers really tell you a lot about it and what the weather is mostly like. i use the computer for mostly everything I do. Comming through our minds have showed you what we have thought about the effects computers have on us today. We can make work a lot easier, talk to other ;people, and get imformation on places you want to visit somebody. The computer is a very reliable source for me and you have lost a lot if you do not agree with me on this.	5	6	11
250	1	I do not believe computers benefit society. Many people spend their life on their computer instead of exercising, going out with friends, or spending time with family. @NUM1? Of @CAPS1 will agree they spend at least @NUM2 hours a day on their computer. Which is unneccessary. Why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays? Because of a lack of @CAPS3. And who is the #@NUM3 cul? Computers of course. In order for more people to maintain healthy, there needs to be a lot of @CAPS3. When someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys in, how much @CAPS3 are they really getting? Plus, there are many different disorders in the world. @PERCENT1 inf will agree that with more @CAPS3, these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided. Too many people are choosing their computer overexercise and it them many health problems that could've easily been avoided. Secondly, everyone would agree that friends are essential in life. But now people are talknig to their friends online or in computer games instead of going to the them. Online there is much more which often break up friendship. Also, online you new people or make as many new friends. @CAPS2 you go and have many more friends, which makes life in general much better. Finally, you wouldn't wants families become would you? Well, this is one of the many effects the @CAPS2 members of a family get together which could weaken them as a family. Plus, husbands and wives could not talk very often, often leading in separation or devorce. This could make a child have in decide between a whole family to @CAPS3, friends, and family are essential in life, and computers put those in jeopardy. So take a stand and end this reign for good, stop the use of computers before it is too late.	5	5	10
267	1	To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 the joy of just clicking a mouse and all of the sudden you are talking with a friend you haven't seen in years. Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importances and plan things and a lot more. First, computers have become a vital part of education and research a like. Students at schools, elementary through college, are able to connect with much more information than without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago. Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the @CAPS2. I recently got a facebook account, and within a few days I had found and to three friends of mine that had moved away a distant cousin who had moved to @LOCATION1 that i haven't seen since we was little and even my great grandmother! The possibilities are endless. Email has also been very beneficial to society as well, as @CAPS5 helps people communicate and plan events, which brings me to my next topic. Lastly, computers help the @CAPS2 communicate with one another. the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our @CAPS2, one being @ORGANIZATION2; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. If not for computers this program wouldn't have been as succesful and beneficial as @CAPS5 has become. Also, is an amazing website that combines education with the aspect of @CAPS2 @CAPS5 quizzes you on different levels of general knowledge and for each correct answer, @ORGANIZATION1 donates @NUM1 grains of @ORGANIZATION1. When i am bored i sometimes go on, and so for i have filled over thirty bowls of @ORGANIZATION1, while learning at the same time! To conlude, computers have proven to benefit the @CAPS2 and all in @CAPS5, not only people but the environment, too. Computers help advance research, help people reconnect with one another, and help the @CAPS2 communicate, Who knows that computers will help us accomplish next?	5	5	10
268	1	Dear, @CAPS1 I would like to tell you something. Throughout the ages we have been evolving, from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly. With evoloution we discovered technology and in recent years we have been making new technologies rapidly. Some say that some technology like computers are bad, I think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about for away places. let you talk to people online and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers let you go places that you ordinarilly wouldn't be able to go to. If you were doing a research projects on @LOCATION1 and you didn't have any books what would you use? That's right, a computer the internet would have the facts you needed, so you could grade. While on the internet you could talk to friends and family who @MONTH1 live for away. The computer goes over long distances and connects both computers so you can bend writing almost instantly. Without computers you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people. Using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. It helps you with your hand-eye coordination. When you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body. Some people say that when you are on the computer you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. I myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too! I love computers, don't you?	4	4	8
275	1	Dear @PERSON1, Advances in technology and computers is a bad thing. When the computer company's such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1, make cool updates to their computer systems people do not want to shut their computer off, which is not a good thing. As a child did you spend all of your time indoors and online? Computers take time away from spending time outside, or exercising. And they affect very crucial family time. Computer advances are bad for our country and town. Now-a -days, kids would much rather spend time on their computers than outside. This can have a very negative affect. First of all, it is important that students see and feel nature, and last time I checked they can not do that on a computer. Children need to see animals, smell the sweet scent of flowers and feel the breeze brush against their cheeks. A second reason that going outside is important is for the sun. Even though the sun does have harmful days, it is still important for health that everyone spends some time in the sun. The computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous. Computer also take precious time away from exercise. If people spend all their time on computers, then do they exercise. Everyone is supposed to get at least @NUM1 minutes of activity daily, but no one ever spends that much time working out. Also, obesity numbers have increased greatly since the invention of personal computer and the internet. Obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to disease. Life with computers has lead to less people exercising and obesity rates increasing. Another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families. Family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family. Plus with encouregement from their family, many students excel in school and sports, which gives them graet self-confidence. Computers take time away from something that should be thw most important to everyone, family. Many people are affected negatively by computers. The technology takes very important time away from children and adults. It takes time away from the outdoors, exercising, and family. Yes, computers @MONTH1 make life easier, but they have a much more negative affect than they do a positive one.	6	5	11
277	1	"Dear @LOCATION2 press, I wonder if you know that @PERCENT1 of people out of @NUM1 surveyed by the university out @LOCATION1 agreed that using lap tops and computers had a very good benefit on their life? I agree that computers benefit society and every day lifes. With a computer, you can interact with people all around the world, they can help with school work, and make every day life eaiser. Five years ago I had to move from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION3. We had to leave all of our family and friends behind. However, with this great tecnology, we could e-mail them. Instant message them, and video chat with them, instead on having to face out money to make long distance calls. Theres many people out their like me. Who have friends and family far away, weather its family in different countries, old school mates and camp friends using a computer is a great way to keep in touch with one another. Using a computer can also more life easier. Moms taking care of their kids might not be able to go to @CAPS1 & @CAPS2 with one kid not wanting to get off his video games, the other watching their favorite @CAPS3 show. Thankfully that man and go online, pick the food that she and the quantity and she can get someone to deliver it. That mother also might not be able to get out and go shopping. So with her computer she can go to her favorite stores website and pick the clothes she wants. And then when @CAPS4 comes, a computer can be great not to worry about not having enough time to go and. A computers just have life that much simpiler!. Statistics how or people help online instant or going in. ""Computers are great, I can homework and know that if they to write planner than they we to and out. If, they can and more of information on the computer from @CAPS5.com, then they could find in their local library. You can find almost anything with search engins on your computer! Some people do disagree with the use of computers, or some also believe that some people abuse the benefit of computers and spend to much time on it and not exercising and enjoying nature enough. This is true, not as long as you stay reasonable with usage or your computer, it benefits you in many ways. Like I said, its great for keeping connections between people, simpling everyday life, and research for school."	4	5	9
287	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Your resources, your entertainment, even your communication with people might be fading. @CAPS8 you know a large portion of people think this @PERSON2 is harming our society. Well I will say I think they don't understand these benifit that computers bring us. Computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination is a perfect example. Plus, we use computers to learn about places we might want to travel to, or have a conversation with frinds or family living ways away tromus. Computers is an extrodarny piece or technology. First, I like to say everything that you do physically uses hand-eye coordination. Making dinner, riding a bike, driving a car etc. And unfortiunitly not @CAPS6 people are the best at hand-eye coordination. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had horriable hand eye coordination. So for his birthday I decided an getting him a computer. It's been @NUM1 month since his he had his computer and @CAPS8 he was trying to hit a baseball at his sons party, he moneged to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3 where he used to hit it @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6. @PERCENT2 is a termendous increase in only @NUM1 month! Just something @CAPS8 simple @CAPS8 a computer improved @CAPS7 friends hand-eye coordination a termendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far away places @CAPS8 the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you really want to travel up to the icey cold, and piercing winds of the @LOCATION1 just to learn about it? For some I'd say like that but what if you cant travel up the @LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions. I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry. A statics from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states ""@PERCENT2 of people wpould love to experience the thrill and excitement of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. But out of those @PERCENT2 only @PERCENT3 said they'd actually travel to @LOCATION2 to see them"". So you can see that @PERCENT4 of those people wouldn't go whether it be due to money or the cold. Thery @CAPS6 said thats why they love the computer. They can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold.Lastly, that better thing to do on the computer than with family you've never met before or don't get to see them. The editor for the @LOCATION3 Local states ""@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarly get to tell to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance ofter. So I use @CAPS7 computer, @CAPS7 parents and I now communicate @PERCENT1 more than we used to. I love the computer it helps keep me close to @CAPS7 loved ones."" @CAPS8 you can tell, thanks to the computer we talk @PERCENT1 more to his parents than he used to! In conclusion, the computer is a gracous device that is extremely benifital to people. The computer teaches us hand-eye coordination, lets us learn about places we other wise would never learn about, and to have conversations with friends or family that we generally dont get to see often. Now you go out and make anyone that says computers are a horrible inventions you tell them exactly why computers are so important!"	6	6	12
321	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on man kind. So many great discoveries and great topics have been found on the compture, studees have shown <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of famous in the united states has at least one computer in there house holds. There a great way look up important information withoout going to the and searching for hours, to contract others, and lets face it they make our a life a whole lot easier. Imagine this! your stressed and on edge you have just @NUM2 hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay. You have a pounding head ache and just want to quit, your probably in the libary reading through hundreds of books. Now imagine you being at home sprawled across your lap, all it takes is a few taps on your keyboard and bam! Instant information. Now how easy was that, thats one of the great impacts computer have made on us, humanity. Computers are terrific to learn things with a fast pase to it. I personally have used computers to @CAPS2 advantage you logon go to google type the subject of knowledge and its just like you have a personal teacher in your own home. A local study has been underway the have a groups, @CAPS6 A which has a libary full of books and @CAPS6 @CAPS3 a @CAPS6 with a @CAPS4 @CAPS5, The scientist gave them all the same essays, @CAPS6 @CAPS3 <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of student have passed with flying colars while @CAPS6 A <@PERCENT1@NUM4> passed with a @CAPS9 or higher. Thats important because higher grades, means higher test scores. higher test scores equal fundimg. I think computers are the best invention and is not imparing humans its evolving them. Imagine this! your sitting at home crying because your special other has moved far away from you well computers are a great way to reconect with that person. Computers have software were you can instant message, send emails, or even video chat with that person. For even some business man its an way to have meetings without flying @NUM5 miles. I have @NUM2 aunts that I cannot live without who are @CAPS2 strong base who I cant live without talking to for a day. Without computers I dont know what I would do. Scientist tool surveys that @PERCENT1 to the @CAPS10.S.A has family in other states, countries, or even contents, hey have to have some way to be in contact. @CAPS2 last reason is I know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier. Some jobs that have opened up giving unwadged citizens a sorce of income on computers. <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of jobs relay on computers. Imagine a chasier counting all the money, a banker having to take time counting one by one other peoples cash, a telemarketer calling with no way of information. All these ways and more that computers have impacted us. Now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability, contracting others, and last but NOT least made me and yours life better. Computers are a terrific way for human to adap to the fast life.	6	6	12
340	1	Computers, More and more people are using them. They are used to talk, for lesieure and many other things. But are computers a good thing? Computers can be a very good thing to have around. Besides practically unlimited information, you can stay in touch with your family using @ORGANIZATION1. You can use @ORGANIZATION2 word to make documents and powerpoint presentations that organize your ideas. Also you can use @ORGANIZATION2 excel to manage your finances! Windows movie maker allow you to contruct your own movies ifl you own a camera. Besides the obvious most helpful features, you can play computer games, watch mores and listen to music on a computer. Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are small and some can be very big. computers are expensive. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer. Also, many people have important information on a computer. Peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer rendering it imposible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence and drug use are all over the web. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over peoples lives. People spend too much time on facebook and not enough time reading or keepng in touch with family. Computers can be great things. Between their great features allowing you to be informed all the time and programs that or be great for managing buisness, it's no wonder almost every @CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I disagree. Yes, the cons can be annoying & sometimes serious. But if your smart enough to stay away from @CAPS2-@CAPS3, install anti-virus software, and never give away your information to an unamed surce, the pros outweigh the cons. So overall, if your smart enough, a computer can be a fun, convienent edition to your life allowing you to do more than you ever imagined.	4	5	9
342	1	"Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that that benefits society. As editor of the newspaper, you have the power to inform people about situations. In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following: the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, they allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, that has @NUM1 little girls. Every day in the morning before school @PERSON1 checks on the weather, on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school. However, one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Little did he know the roads were extremely icey. Sadly @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones. As you can see, the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room. Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states says that, ""chating online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp and many other places."" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school. Also @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. I believe that chating online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades. Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time. However teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing. Finally most jobs today use computers. For example my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also the chat can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer revolutionise the jobs of people. In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society. Please take my idea into consideration."	5	4	9
343	1	Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 and I am a @NUM1 year old girl; yet active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity. All of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay. I dont you want a happy and successful life?! I know I do!	5	4	9

361	1	Computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers help people in many ways. They teach people about history and faraway places. They also are a great way to yourself. Computers also are another way to comunicate to people for away it only a few houses down. Computers have a of knowledge and more is added everyday. Everyday i go on the computer i learn something new. You can search the word @LOCATION1 and instantly have millions of web pages in fron of you that all had new knowlage and exciting things about @LOCATION1. Computers are much faster than having to go down to local library and look for a book that has the information you need. You can also find diffrerent veiws and perspectives of a subject online. Depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events, which you cannot find books at the library. Computers have a amount of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things. Computers can also entertain you. There are many entertaining website online that you can go to when you bored. There are books and magazines you can read at anytime you want. If you like to read then check online, these @MONTH1 be a book you enjoy free of charge to read. Some people like to play games. On the computer you can find almost any game you want to play. These are board games, video games, strategy game, adventure games, and many many more than that. I could go on for hours listing at the different types. If you like sports you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports. You could find ways to improve how you play or you to play that sport. If you like to watch @CAPS1. you can also do that on a computer. Some @CAPS2.V programs put the diffrent episodes online so people can easily view them just by one click of the mouse. Computer can anybody who uses it. Computers help tech you things entertain you. but they also can communicate to your friends and family. Many programs let you to people through the internet. You could send emails to your cousin half way across the world. In emails you can attach pictures and files with text to communicate. These are various programs. IM means instant messaging, that means that instantly you message to another person using that program. You put a message in and away it goes instantly reaching ther person you trying to teach. Now thse are even more to communicate. you can make audio calls to a person using the computer. It is like a phone just not.Web cams make it possible to record and send video instantly, but can also uses to talk to one through a video call. The program connects you to your friends or family and you can see them thourhg a video. computers are a great way to comunicate with others. Computers help in a positive way. They give you access to an amazing amount of information. They can you. Computers also great way to communicate to people no matter how far away that person is. I would completly say that computers are a positive thing.	5	5	10
363	1	I agree that computers do benefit society because every one uses one or has one it helps you with important stuff the computer makes things easy. Computers, give exercise in a way it makes your fingers move faster. The computer is the best thing ever that happend to this world you can chat with your friends family, print writing play games. What can get better than that we can research a famous person google dead people look up pictures. But the computer makes you lazy because it makes you wana just sit there never get off of it its addicting to people but others just don't know the meaning of using or having a computer. If the others had an computer they would change there mind. You can go on myspace thinks to tom talk to friend family people from a diffrent town, state. You also can go on google yahoo, facebook, twitter the computer and internet is really fun and it give you a little exercise. And it helps you with your school work, home work, research of a country, place, house, vacation you can do lots of things. But then the other people have a point enjoying nature is good because it gets you healthy strong and it will get playing sports more and having fun outside instead of staying in side all day doing nothing staring at your computer screen not wanting to get sleep or going out side so both pretty much the same to me but I do with the first opionion because computers are the best!	4	4	8
371	1	About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature.	4	4	8
374	1	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that people who uses alot of technology such as computer are not good, technology can affect adults and even more is children. Children who go on chatting websites such as facebook are starting to see a difference which is in there grades. I found out children who gois on face book are starting to not turn in home work and there grades are going completly down, I heard a student say once he had got on face book he stoped doing his homework and reading his grade dropeed from a @CAPS1 t a @CAPS2 average because he was much focused on the computer than school and his reading. I belive computers can be really addicted to people the first time you get on a website it go's from once a day to twice a day and further on its as if the computer is sometime connected to you and we can let go. People who allow themself to chat online can also be a dangerous thing, young females and males think its exciting to chat with some one in a different state or city but its not exciting its very dangerous. Chating online is very dangerous because the person that you are talking to could have murdered people or could have kidnapped kids or could be wanied but we wouldn't know because on chat lines you dont have to put your fear name, you could put a false picture, and unknown age that's why in cases something go missing because they didd'ent think before they started chating. Another reason why using or being on a computer can be bad because it can lead to a strong distraction from you family instead of sitting down and asking your family now was thier day you'll be in a rush to go on the computer. The computer can also lower you test and quiz grades you can be on the computer for a maximum of hours that you need to be studying for a huge exam the next day and when you fail theres no one to blame but yourself because of your addiction to the usage of an computer. In conclusion @PERCENT1 of people have been affected by computers and its not a good thing you could miss a day out of work or you can be tired and exhaused because all your energy is wasted stay off of computers unless educational.	3	4	7
382	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1's benefit society imensely. They help us learn about far away places, they help us with our school work and the let us communicate with other people online. We need computers. Computers allow us to learn about other countries, people, @CAPS1 etc... How would we learn about places we might want to go on vacation? Or how would we learn about the places we want to see, and the places we want to stay away from? We need computers to do this. We would never even know of some countries if it werent for computers. Next computers help us with our school work. Sometimes we get project spend most of them involve research! Computers make this a whole lot easier on us. Also instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back, we can use online textbooks. Why give us extra work, it's a waste of everyones time. Instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone, you can chat online. Wasting minutes is wasting money. Who wants to do that? Besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 studens, say they prefer to talk online then to call someone. Computers benefit us by easy aces to info. Computers are a lot easier to help us with school work, than textbooks are. Lastly computers let us talk to other people online. Without computers everything would be so much harder.	3	4	7
387	1	Dear, editor @CAPS1 you know, @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer that do not exercize can develop weight problems and blood disorders? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far. If advances continue that number will increase and other problems @MONTH1 arise from it. Some other problems that we have @DATE1 that could get worse are, developing a weak immune system, and emotionally seperating yourself from your family. First, lets talk about obesity. Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being, basically, addicted to the computer. Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause you to have a heart attack. Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body. Which leads to, eventually, promote death. Dealing with obesity is bad enough, but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrable. In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally don't have very good immune systems. For example, a friend of mine is on the computer quite often, and has developed a weak immune system. Because of it he misses at least @NUM1 day of school a week. And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keep bad grades. Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea. So isn't it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea? Especially being that, children are steadily becoming obese, and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable? So I urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology.	4	4	8
401	1	Dear, @CAPS1 paper edattor we should stop because people arent doing anything their just staying home using the computer. Making there life worser they should make a day whith out computors and every one goes out side and gets exsesise. Wo could mapse the world better the more you. Exersise the stronger you get people livse computers because they could there frends play games thats but some time we have to go outside. Some times i like using the computer but a littile to much land that i dont get that mach exesersise and i hope i could stop from that and go out side and exersise more. We would have computers but we wont use it like for along time then spend more outside. We should only olw kids for only two or three hours a day. When there using the computer they use over like hours thats not good they should go out side thats why.	3	3	6
407	1	I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. All these things are good so why not use computers, we need computers. Do you think computers are a positive effect or a negative effect? After you hear this you might want agree with computers have a positive effect. Computers have a positive effect in so many ways for example: school, work, talk to other, and just get information. From different websites. If we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books. We would get information from the books but not as much as we would get from the computer. We probably would not know that much if it wasn't ofr computers. The reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands. That proves hand-eye coordination. We learn about places we don't live in like that? Had a earthquake we went on websites for that. You get to learn how it is in a certain place you want to go on vacation for. You get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity. Computer is something people use to talk to people and keep in contact. Now we have @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and others. We use that to talk to our friend and family. Some of our family or friends live in far away places so we use the computer to talk. If you have a e-mail teachers and people at work might have to e-mail each other to handle business. You can even get work for students at school so that way the can learn more and do different activities. You can even play games on the computer. You can explore nature on the computer. I think computer is a great way to learn and talk with others. Do you want your child to learn? Do you want your child to have fun? So tell me what you think! Computers have a positive effect.	4	4	8
408	1	I believe that computers have a negitive effect on people. Using the computer effects a person's time because the sit for hours playing online games, @CAPS1 also effects there heath because there not getting any fresh air or spending time with there family, lastly @CAPS1 effects there education because time they could be using doing there homework there on there computer. First useing the computer effects a person's time, @CAPS1 does that by wasteing hours sitting there when you could be outside playing or doing chores around your house. You could be helping your family or friends out but instead playing computer games. There goes all the time you could have been doing something good, wasted because of the computer. The computer also effects you heath because your in a room inside not getting any air. You're also not exerciceing and helping your body out. This could effect your emotional heath. When your on the computer your not talking to people and becoming social and you could loose connections with you friend and your family. When you loose your connections and become you will use your computer more and then @CAPS1 will become worse. My last reason is that @CAPS1 effects education because when you could be doing your homework and studing for an important lest on your on the computer learning nothing, then you will school and possably mess for ever! This is really bad because you were on the computer. A couple times I pushed homework aside to use the computer and my grades drops alot. So this is why @CAPS1 effects education. These are the reasons how the computer effects education, your heath, and your time. I know your thinking that computers could be used for education, but humans prefer fun over anything else and I hoped this helped you realized that.	4	4	8
448	1	"Computers are very enchanced pieces of machinery. With this high-@CAPS7 object comes knowledge of many different places and what is happening around the world. Next, typing is a universal way of writing that is much faster than hand-writen pieces. Lastly, @CAPS5 is a convenient and fun way to relieve stress by interacting with other users around the world. These are thousands of news sbrics, evey day of the year that do not ultimately get coverd because of limited are time on news channels. To quickly and simply get your news from around the world you can visit a website and lock at hundreds of stories at the click of a button. To add to that, you will get more in-depth news for these is no limit on room or space on the website. These will even be areas on the website to donate to the that need assistance. patrick @PERSON3, founder of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, stated"", @CAPS4 bring in billions at dollars in aid to people who otherwise would be in deep trouble, and the main source of all of this money is from internet websites.""@CAPS3 the internet, millions of people would not even know about these people who desprately need help. Typing is a quick and fairly simple way to write, that saves people valuable time. Teaches often assign writing homework, which takes about twice as long to hand-write other than type. Using typing would save you this time and allow you to continue on with other important tasks that are needed to be completed. Furthermore, typing is a mandatory class for many freshmen and previous experience is very helpful to the teachers and students. ""@CAPS4've had many students,""says typing intruder @PERSON2, and the ones that excel not only get an 'A', but also cut there homework time in half. Stress is a common problem in all age groups, and a computer is the best way to releive @CAPS5. Interactive game with people around the world will broaden your specturm to other cultures. You way use your typingskills to talk with others, and share your opinions with them.""@CAPS5 @MONTH1 seem a shock,"" says @PERSON1 at @CAPS6 @CAPS7"", but people who use computers an hour a day are much more culturaly advanced that the others.""To add to that, you can use video chat to talk to people in foreign areas. Friends, family, and exchange students are able to talk and see you through video chat. This greatly reduces parent stay of their children living in a foreign country.Many people"	5	4	9
451	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it. For a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives. Another reason is, if you need a @ORGANIZATION1 work-out or healthy eating tips, you can just print them out. And my last reason is if you're going on a far away trip but you don't know the way, you can just print out directions (@ORGANIZATION2). Say if you have a relative that lives all the way in @CAPS1 but you can't call them because you live all the way in the @LOCATION1 And if you call them, it'll cost you about @MONEY1 per minute. What you can do is you can contact them over the computer (webcam). And it's way better than just calling them because you can actually see them. Or if your on a business trip away from home, you can check upon your family. My second reason is, you can stay fit while being on the computer. You can look up @ORGANIZATION1 ""yoga"" poses. Or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer. And if you're on a diet, you can look up @ORGANIZATION1 healthy recipes. You can also get @ORGANIZATION1 work-out equipment that'll make (or keep you), nice and slim. My last reason is that if you're going on a long journey away from home you need to now the way. But, what if you don't know the way? You can go on the internet and look up directions. And that is way better because at least you arent wasting money on a @MONEY2 @ORGANIZATION3. And it is more and quicker. And the best part is that you don't have to keep looking at the @ORGANIZATION3 and program stuff. With the maps on the computer, you can print it out and actually keep it. Those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers. There are many things that a computer can do which is really good. You can communicate with relatives, stay fit/healthy while on the computer and getting maps. I hope that this opens up many peoples eyes. And maybe change a couple scientist's mind."	4	4	8
469	1	"Computers are progressing into our lives more and more. These machines help our world become an easier place to do. work, pay bills and even entertain ourselfs. @CAPS3, these things are weighed down by the negative effects like the online dangers, increasing  to reality, and the obesity problems we face. With our new advances people are spending more time sitting around than being outside, which udds more and more to obesity problem we face. Kids and teens today would much rather be on their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 account, than go for a run or shoot some hopps. Also, more and more ads are on the web for unhealthy foods making these kids more likely to eat more junkfood. Finally, the internet fools people into believing they can go on easy diet eat. and become skinny with no worries. Along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats. Viruses can hack you computer, steal you personal info and destroy you computer. You can have huge bills for things you didn't even buy! Cyber bullies are also a new and dangerous threat!. These people threaten and taught inosent people. I remember a story of a girl who took her own life because she was bullied by someone who turned out to be another girl and her mother. Finally, online predators are a great threat to teens. These people brain wash people, convince them to meet, and rape and kill them. Last but not least todays computers interaction with young minds increases ignorance with ads, and negleck of education and reading. Many kids even myself would rather be online than read a book or do homework. @CAPS3, computer can take over some people's likes, they will neglect school and other important things like homework or studing credting weaker minds for out future. Also, ads and website with false information can fall down our youth even more with ignorance and ignorant belifs. Finally, kids computer interaction can cause belites like ""you shout vote for @PERSON1 because he is black"" or other racist and ignorant statements. Computers help our advance in bettering the world and our understanding of our world, @CAPS3, certain aspects can create ignorance and danger for people yound and old, and their minds."	4	5	9
478	1	"Computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things. Many of @LOCATION1 spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday. Being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you. @DATE1 too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than doing other activities. Therefore, computers are not the best way to spend your time because you get less excersize, your school grades can lower, and your communication skills will weaken. First, when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends. In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, many more people are becoming obese, creating unhealthy genes to be passed on. Perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, see movies, and even to get a college education. Less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers there would be more free time for people to get outside, or play sports. Secondly, many kids and teens are attached to their laptop, and bring it everywhere with them. So, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Must chose to go on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 rather than opening their books. Plus, spending so many hours on a computer. less time to do their homework, so they just begin to not do any of it. Computers take away their time that could be used towards getting a college education, why waste them? Lastly, why talk on the phone or in person when you can just send them an e-mail or chat online with them? Many people @DATE1 are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face to face. This can cause a lack of communication skills, something that might sound good online, could sound absolutely terrible in the ""real"" world. This loss of skill, could lead to a generation of more cyber talk rather than @CAPS3. In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside, or hanging out with friends? Personally I'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer."	4	4	8
488	1	Computers have little to no effect on people. In fact computers help us out a lot. They help us in find @CAPS1, medical, research and to tell weather or not you have cancer. The computers that people think of are machines that sit in a room and is used often but not for its purpose. People use it sometimes for entertainment not research. There aren't just those kind of computers. There are bigger more advanced computers that scientist use every day. @CAPS2 computers do have an effect on us, but in a good way. Most of the time those people playing games or music are kids who are bopard. They use it a little too often. I anly play with it on rainy days when I can't go outside and play. Humans use computers mainly because it makes life simpler, easier. @CAPS2, it does make life simpler, like for example instead of handwriting a report, you can type it or intead of searching everywhere in a book, you can go straight to the information. One last example is; when you want to stay updated on your favorite sport team, you don't have to go to their game you just have to go to their web site. In my opinion I say that @CAPS2, computers do have and effect on us but a good reason. I'm a sports fan so I play a lot of sports. I use the computer offer for fun and research. It dosen't have an effect on me. It dosen't effect at all because I still exercise a play with my friends very often, like everyday. There is no reason to why people can't use computers quite often. Computers don't have a positive effect sometime, but it doesn't have a negitive effect sometime either. I exercise, enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too. I also use the computer often. Experts shouldn't be concerned with people using computers too much.	4	4	8
491	1	Dear, @CAPS1 Who would'nt agree that more and more people are using computers. The isusse is @CAPS2 bad or good for you. My opinion on this matter is that agree that computer are bad and people are spending. Too much time on computer. Also I agree with that because people are spending more time on computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend, And thats my opinion on why people spending to much time on computers. Cearly you can that people spending too much time on computer and less time exercising. I say because i rember a time when my you to spend most of his time on computers and not for school eitner he would story on for all most the whole day he would bring food up stairys and throw the plates on floor just keep eating and eating and go to sleep without doing any thing. He would do this day after day. when I go over his house it would be dirty after all those times my my to hold him to clean up he didnt after he ate I ash edition want to got for a you can @PERSON1 the of and caliores he would say no I can walk on the computer, @CAPS3 one day he became really part and the doctor said you obeased but do you think he cared no but we would try to push him ever day to exercision know he has dibietes. We told and him told him spending to much time on computers is bad for you. Another reason why spending too much time on computer is bad because you need to learn how to enjoy nature and get out scid. I rember a time when my friend would story in his house for day on a computer when I would ash him to come out sid he would say no all time, @CAPS3 one he to come out sid to get a new computer sofeware and when he opend door he got scared of the lite and run in side reason why spending to much time computers is bad for you this prove that get and play get active 	4	4	8
519	1	"Dear Readers, Computers have a large presence in the world today. Most people in the @LOCATION1 have at least one and the number grows still. These computers are bad for people. They cost a lot of money cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. Computers cost a lot of money. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintanence, they are very expensive. Dr. @PERSON2, a computer science expert, claims, ""The average computer costs @MONEY1. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with antivirus programs and other protection. Now we could be talking about @MONEY2 at the very least. With yearly maintanence costing about @MONEY3 per year, you can see how expensive these machines really are."" @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. Thats a lot of many going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems, there are health issues too. Computers take a lot of time away from people. When a computer is used, the user doesn't move around or exercise. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the @LOCATION1 has skyrocketed, but it's not just food, Some experts are now contributing computer use to lack of exercise, and therefore, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS3 matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but that could be a problem. It is a quite easy to find something out, or research a topic using a computer. Before computers became popular, people had to work and look for @CAPS4. Now that it is so easy, children @MONTH1 begin to think things come easily in life. @PERSON1, a pediatric psycologist, says, ""The mind of a child works in a such a way, that most things they encounter are absorted and become normal. If a child becomes use to the ease of searching an item on a computer, he will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not he @MONTH1 become frustated and not be able to do what is needed."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll takers agree that finding @CAPS4 on the computer is quite easy. What are the children of the world being taught? Life is easy, a false statement. Computer use is a growing problem. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problmes, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing. Computers are bad for the people of the world, they take our money, our health and the minds of our children."	6	6	12
522	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I have herad that you guys are deciding whether or not computers have a negative or positive impact on the society. In my opinion, I believe computers have a very negative impact not only to adults but mostly to students too. Computers in general can be distracting, very dangerous, and give people less time to excercise. Computers in total do not have a bad impact on people. Some people say computers are not distracting, well I say they are. Computers have varies websites such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework. @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are websites where you can chat with friends and see peoples pictures. These websites can be very interupptive when trying to do something important. For example, I am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying. If I had to choose between doing homework or chatting on @CAPS1, I would choose @CAPS1. But if you actually think about, are these websites benefitting anybody. Homework and studying can actually benefit you in doing better can benefit you in your studies and ferther on in your life. In total, I believe computers are a big distarction. When people go on the computer they go on without worrying a little bit. They don't know the danger behind it. These dangerous computer have people on it called online predators. Online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others. One website in specific that I herad was very harmful is myspace. This website is even more dangerous then @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Myspace is like @CAPS1 in a way but very dangerous. For instance, my mom told me that one of her friends daughter had a myspace and became friends with a guy she didn't know. Of course she didn't worry because according to her he seemed a nice guy so she gave him her number. Good thing her mom saw it, otherwise something bad would happend. He ended up being an online predator. Lastly, computer can make people unhealthy. People who stare on computers non-stop can make them not exercise. For example, not playing sports such as soccer, vollyball, and tennis. This is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy. This is why computers can make you not exercise. In conclusion, computers can have a very negative effect on people. It can be very distracting, dangerous, and unhealthy for not exercising. In total, computers cannot have a bad impact on people.	5	4	9
529	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I agree that the effects computers have on people can be very negative to people, but they should realize what they are doing to themselfs and what they can get themselves into. Starting with people are on the computers more then they are using the phone, this takes effects on people sitting around on their computers and not cleaning their homes and taking care of their homes; but instead they are on the laptops or desktops. Secondly parents and childrens spend most of they time on websites to talk with their friends for example webcam and aim, this takes affect people because they can go on the phone or meet them up some place. In conclusion, people, but mostly teenagers and a little bit of adults up to ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 like to go on different websites sum as myspace.com, facebook.com, formspring.com, and more this constart rumors and can end up in bad or goods situations this can be a horrified effection on these people that do this very often. Some people and mostly teens, and that can be caused it will always be a he say she say, this is why people should log off immediantly. Most importantly people should become aware of themselves or people they might know or might know, knowing this putting into negative situations @MONTH1 at them in harm.	3	4	7
530	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have a very strong belief that children and adults are spending far away too much time the computer. Please consider the following that computers have a negative effect on people. Furthermore, @PERCENT1 of parents agree with experts that @CAPS3 spend way too much time on the computer but less time with friends. @CAPS11 I was little I rarely ever went on the computer. But now my parents have to consult me to leave the computer multiple times. Ever since teens have joined @CAPS7, myspace, and twitter, they are addicted to it and can't stop going on it to @CAPS6 what their friends are posting. Physcologist @PERSON2 states, ""@CAPS3 who are on the internet for multiple hours a day, can't concentrate in school because their minds are on what they've going to @CAPS8 on @CAPS11 they get home."" @CAPS4 up, @CAPS5, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, @CAPS8 to school, get home, @CAPS6 @CAPS7. This is the daily reutine of a teenager in the @DATE1. Secondly, going on the computer constantly can cause health problems. @NUM1 percent of teens who non-stop use the computer have to wear glasses or contacts, because of overusing the computer. @CAPS11 I use the computer without a break for multiple have I get a terrible headache because my eyes can't take any more of it. ""@CAPS11 @CAPS3 stay up laye on the computer they are, have fatigue the next morning."" @CAPS12 pediatrician @PERSON1 and middle schoolers are very much the most popular users of the interner, because they are mostly very tired and @CAPS11 at school. People who stay up very late have very black saggy lines under their eyr, so if you see a person like taht they are a overuser of the internet. Most @CAPS3 who are very pole also never get to @CAPS8 outside @CAPS11 using the internet all the time. Lastly children are missing out on the beauty of nature. @CAPS3 who don't get enough excersize, cant think clearly becasue tehre is no oxygen in their brains. Obesity is begginning to tape a toll on children who only sit inside and @CAPS5 junkfood. Children who rarely @CAPS8 outside and excersize become overweight or obese. @PERCENT2 of children instratford almost never @CAPS8 outside and excersize. As I was in elementary school, we had recess but now in middle school we never have it. The only chnace we have to @CAPS8 outside in the @DATE3 and in the @DATE2 @CAPS11 it's warm."	5	5	10
559	1	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?	6	6	12
567	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers can be a good thing and a bed thing for many resons. First i think it's good because it can help school work like to do a research and for other things that you might have to do for school. A secound reson on why computers are helpful is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. It also can have people talk to their family member from a other country through a web-cam. All their computers can be realy helpful they can also be bad for your health and family. I agree that it can give less time exercising, instead of being on the computer you can go to the park or walk your and many other things then just bring on the comuter all day. It can also distroy your interacting with family and and friend if you stay in the house all the time useing the computers and your family and friends want to spend some time with you and your just on the camper. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper wher the reasons why i think computers can be a good thing and a bed thing. I mostly think that computers are a good thing because if we didn't have computers we wouldnt have most of the things we now have in the world if it wasn't for computers. That's why i think computers can be more helpful just depending on the way you use it and how much you use it. Those were the opinions i had on computers.	4	4	8
571	1	"Computers today are much different from computers back then. They help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I think that computers help people in many ways, like teaching a hand-eye coordination. They're useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they haven't seen in a long time and computer skills are required in the real world. Hand-eye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination. This helps because if one has to type a @NUM1-page report, then one who has good hand-eye coordination, or typing skills, ""can finish a report in @NUM2 minutes or so. If one has poor hand-eye coordination, well that @NUM2 minute report will take about a few hours. No one likes to be sitting infront of a computer for a few hours. Everyone has friends and best friends that they talk to every day, But what happens if that friend moves out-of-town, out-of-state or possibility out-of-country? They might be forgotten or never seen from again. Well, thanks to technology and the advancement of computers, people can chat online on @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, myspace or facebook. They can catch upon things, check out what's new, even see posted pictures of them. The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away. Who wouldn't want to talk to friends or family that haven't been heard from? Lastly, having computer skills is very, very, very important in the real world. Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programer for the state, or they can create websites for their own jobs. Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or @CAPS2 shows. That's big money there. No wonder schools have computer classes. It's to get students to have a good background of the computer. Computers are not that bad. They teach hand-eye coordination, lets people talk to other people online and can get people great jobs. Many educated people would agree that computers doesn't have a positive effect on people."	4	5	9
579	1	"Dear, Newspaper I believe that the use of computer is so horrorable thing for the people of the world. I think this because they don't exercise enjoy the great outdoors and have good time with family and friends. When you are on the computer you are not exercising you body. This is a problem because @CAPS2 this ""no exercising"" thing does stop the life span could be greatly shorten. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 this doesn't stop more and more children will grow larger and not healthy. So the children care more about the internet the being healthy. @CAPS3 expert @PERSON1 said ""@PERCENT1 of children in school today are over @NUM1 pounds in grades @NUM2, when it should be only a average of @NUM3 pounds or less in grades @NUM2."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the computer craze does not stop kids will continue not to go out side and get to have some fun. Smart parensts are wanting their children to have fun in the back yard. @CAPS2 children are inside and not out side they with not get vitimans from the sun. The experts at @ORGANIZATION1 said ""@CAPS2 the children do not stop going on computers then they with never see the true beauty of the outdoors."" @CAPS3 you can see nature is some thing children need. Interacting with friends and family is important for everyone. Because @CAPS2 one family member is having a health problem and has to go to the hospital no one is there to be with them because they never talk to each other. One year I found out the my great grandmother died of cancer. I had no idea that she had cancer. And I wish I was at the hospital with her. But wasn't because me and her never talked. Don't let that kind of thing happen to you talk and have fun with you friends and family. So @CAPS3 you can see that the use of computers is horrorable because you life can end sooner, your children get fat, and you drift apart from you friends and family. So don't let this happen to anyone else. Tell everyone."	4	4	8
582	1	With the click of a mouse, you can access the internet. Computers and internet are a recent innovation. You could probably find one in a common household. They've improved and gotten popular within the last twenty years. I believe they greatly benefit society. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate. Think about how life would be in the @DATE1 without computers. Different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources; such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. The computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it. It's as easy as that. Another benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to @LOCATION1 due to jobs. Thanks to internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them. Im sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messanger, or facebook, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convienent than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you. If we didn't have this connection with forgein countries, everyone’s lives would be different. Computers haven't just changed personal lives. They change the medical field too. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures. Computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis. This saves the lives of many people. @PERCENT1 of tests that have taken place to research a dicsease use a computer of some sort to break it down. The technology of computers has benefitted today’s society and has helped people achieve great things. It keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn. I hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today.	6	5	11
583	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts in people staying on the computer to much. The reason why is family and friends are distant, mood swings can occur and also being overweight, finally computers can do a lot of things @CAPS1 far. To be on the computer too much, your family will start to worry about you. If you were to stay on a computer for a whole day, taht causes people to think otherwise of how you are. Also if you were to stay inside on a @DATE1 and your friends come over but you say, ""I don't wanna go out"", there just drifting away slowly. Since I am a teen I stay up texting and talking and going outside and I hate to see on of my friend's on the computer when I wanna hang out. When I was @NUM1 or @NUM2, I used to always be on the computer for like days to weeks, until my friend's and family said don't let this get to you. I had a friend who was a good athlete and very funny and nice, but when his mom got him a computer, I didn't want to be his friend. When I was @NUM2 I use to get mad at everything if I couldn't use the computer, it was like I was a brat. Also I used to be big, (as in overweight) because I never went outside to exercise or in my own room. The reason being on why I stopped being his friend was he to get mad if I come over there to ask if he can come outside. Also when he did come outside he used to never do nothing or run because he was always @CAPS1 tired, @CAPS1 what I am trying to say is the computer can really change people in a lot of bad way's. The last thing which makes everyone change is what computer's can do now. For example, a game called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 can get you addicted @CAPS1 fast, you barely do anything elese. Another bad thing is @CAPS4, sure you keep in touch with friends but if you stay on too long, it's basically hooked you into it. Lastly online chatting room's or games when you can create a person to look like you makes you think that's gonna be your life from now on. Also people think that computer's can do anything it really can't, everything a computer can do is like a drug it's addicting. Well I just gave you a little thing of a lot of thing's a computer can do but to refresh your memory I'll say it again. A reason why I agree is family and friends seem distant to you at times you get mood swing's and less exercising, lastly what a computer could do now. Since you know now of the danger's that can happen I suggest you rethink about computers."	4	5	9
587	1	More and more people use computers in fact about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T has computers, everyone uses them. I think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing, jobs, and schoolwork. This is why I think having a computer is a good things what do you think? As I was say computers are good for emailing, even I.ming. lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is. You can just push that power button and tree to your coach asking what time you need to be at the feild. Also theres I.Ming, its wen you can talk to your friends online its a great way to comunicate and meet new people. Emailing is great, its so hi-tect you can email one of your family members who live thousand miles away from you. I once did that my aunt's lisa was in florida and i asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches and she did, they were eye catching. Next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs. In todays world everything is ran by computers for example each registers. A.T.M. and car are ran off of computers. So having it for a job is great. Lets your tells you to fax over a copy can do it the computer within a minute i know my dads job requires of he keeps it all to his witch on his desktop on his laptop. This is why most jobs have computers. Do you are one? Lastly, school was computers . For example my teacher on his computer atendence, homework and . If he didn't have that, he would be lost. Its also good for the kids too. Every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that. Did you know is a program were you can look at your grades and missing assignments? It's call power school. Computers are great for school. I think every one should have one. So what do you think about them? Are they amazing or what? I think are very helpful because you can use them for emailing, working, and school work. If it wasn't for computers we would really know as much as we do now. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T have them. Computers are gonna help you through life alot, welcome to the real world.	5	4	9
596	1	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think people need to see the realatey from computer's and the real world, they're a lot of people spending to much time on the computer and not spending enough time with there familys or doing things that are really important. While your on the computer your not getting any exsercise your not getting stronger your just sitting down. Thats one of the ways people get fat because there not moveing around just sitting down. When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on. I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter! But you really can't tell people how long there allowed to spend on the computer you can only give an opinon and hope they listen.	3	3	6
607	1	Dear newspaper, I read an article in the newspaper that said how people on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit. I actually think it’s a good idea about people being on their computers. I have a few reasons why this is a good thing. Whenever a student needs information on a certain topic, then they use the internet for help. Research is helpful because there could be a lot of sites on-line that could give you what you need. The topics typed into search engines will help find any information help to you. Whenever a teacher @MONTH1 need an assignment typed, you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day. You can also find interesting pictures on what you're learning about. Sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into. It would sometimes be a good idea not to search for something all night, or someones going to be mad at the electricity bill. Also, it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake. Using the internet doesn't need to be for work only. People use computers to shop on-line, check times for movies, and talk with friends. People talking to friends on-line is good because they @MONTH1 not be able to talk however they want in school, and you @MONTH1 not get to see them on the weekends. Teens who talk on-line usually talk with their best friends. If one friend on a group of friends probablly in the same town as you, then they could talk by using their laptops they bring anywhere. Then you could probably hear about something that you (and your friends) have in common which @MONTH1 be coming somewhere that's by where you live. So being on the computer to talk with friends isn't so bad. Students who are young, usually get to learn to type. This could help them in the future if you need to type up an assignment for school, a job application, or college application. Learning to type is good because you also get to see which keys are where and wont need to look at them alot. Soon, you would be able to type a certain amount of words in a short amount of time. This @MONTH1 also be help with reading and understanding big words. In conclusion, I think, computers don't hace too much of an effect on people. As long as they'er not on there for more than two hours, then they're fine. Using the computer seems to have more advantages than disadvantages.	4	5	9
610	1	Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 people think that computers are good for socity but I do not. Computer's riskes out weighs the benighits. My first example is my father. My father never turned on a computer in his life and his buisness is doing fine. My father and his father has all of their records in a safe. One of my fathers friends had everything on his computer. When a virus hit it all of his files were gone and along with his records. My father handwrites all of his papers. He says if i need to type something out i'll buy a type writer. Also on things like facebook someone can see everything that another is doing. This is were alot of people pose as someone eles and thus @CAPS2 people get kidnapped or killed. A very good reason is that when people have alot of personal information when a virus hitls that person knows everything about you that you put on. For exampel i was watching a show on discovery channel when a man hacked into a myspace acount and used that persons name to people and try to create a cyder to the pentagon, that person almost got caught but never was. So you can see why my family does not like computers. My family is always at the farm or in the barn working on we have no time to be on the internet the only thing you need it for is school work. What ever happened to the old fasion way no computer, no problems.	3	4	7
613	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are using technology. A lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability, others disagree. I personally feel that computers are an advantage but also disadvantage. I say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning. I say it is a disadvantage because a lot of people are on the computer and they don't get a lot of exercise. There are pros and cons to computers but manly cons. How long do you stay on the computer? @CAPS2 people find computers more entertaing than going outside and getting some exercise. Since technology is advancing, more and more people are going out to buy computers. A lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer, playing games and going on their favorite websites. That is one reason why children from the ages @NUM1 and up are obese. They don't get enough exercise. That also leads into people spending time with your friends and family. I know alot of people like to spend time with their friends and family. But what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family. Your friends might ask you to go to the park with them, and you say no. Your friends are going to start pulling away from you. You might end up being lonely. Being on the computer constantly can ruins your life. If you are choosing the computer over other important thing, then I think we have a problem. Going on the computer all the time can became an addiction. I don't think people realize it, but it can. I can take over your life. I say this because when you have an addiction to anything, it is hard to stop. It is possible to stop all by yourself but thats rare. Majority of the times it is best to seek help, I personally think you should take all of these reasonings into consideration.	4	4	8
640	1	Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Survey’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality.	4	3	7
661	1	In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether if for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends @NUM1 years of his or her life on the comptuer. Thats a total of @NUM1 years of life waste. Most kids spend all day on the computer on @CAPS1, facebook, @CAPS2, and youtube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids dont realize how short life is, they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with there family, or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the halarious video on youtube that got over one million hits. Also, as you @MONTH1 know child obesety is on the rise, they are more overweight kids then there are then and healthy. If a you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pamedemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for @NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be alot healtheir and have lost the weight I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisiness object. 	4	4	8
669	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the Use of computers. Computers can be fun and interesting, But, people are spending to much time on the computer. @CAPS3 opinion is you should spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I also think that @CAPS2 is easy to get addicted to the computer, I should @CAPS1 I was a person that spent @CAPS3 time @NUM1 on the computer and @CAPS2 wasn't good. You should be safe on the computer because now and days @CAPS2's dangerous @CAPS2 is appalling that people spend More time on the computer than with ther own Family. Don't you agree? Well you shoud, your society, family, and friend should be the most important thing to you. You shouldn't be spending your whole day on the computer, you should be interacting with the people around you. Now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family. That shouldn't be going on. Although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you. You should think about this because this is happening to much in the world. @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS3 school say their addicted to the computer, and @PERCENT2 of the people in @CAPS3 community say their addicted to the computer too. Those are very high numbers don't you think? This is terrible and should stop going on. The computer is like a drug, you can get on the computer one time, then your just going to want to stay on ti everyday all day. The first time you get on the computer you will be addicted to @CAPS2 right away. I'm not saying you should never get on the computer, but be sure you won't get too addicted to @CAPS2 because @CAPS2 can happen very easily. @CAPS3 mother always sayed be safe on the computer"". At first I didn't really @CAPS1 what she meant, but now I @CAPS1. What ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete @CAPS2. So, you should be safe and don't put any thing on the computer if you would want anyone else to see @CAPS2. Anyone can see what you put so you should be safe. Kids are meeting people they don't @CAPS1 and try to meet them. So you should watch out because the computer is the only place @CAPS7 you can lie. Now you should understand @CAPS7 im coming from. You should now agree with me and under stand that people should spend more time you don't get addicted and be safe."""	4	4	8
685	1	In this modernized world computers are key. They offer many benefits that enclude communication, enterntainment, and an education. These benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why I support the advances in technology. Communication is a large benifit with computers. Whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing business meetings computer offer a large amount of aid. With the modern technology that is provided with the computer, people can instantly send messages to co-workers or friends in a matter of seconds. In some cases businesses completly relie on the computer to function; for example, to have conversation with people accross the globe to discuss they are going to expand internationaly. Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable people to make plans with simply and effectively. The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment. With the internet the computer provides the users with websites that enable them to talk to friends, watch videos, play games, and more. The computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or a rainy-day. The computer enables people to stay entertained, and relaxed when needed. The most important function of the computer is education. The computer supplies the user or student with a wide variety of information. The computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that @MONTH1 be brought up in a class room. It comes to be very useful for research projects or even learning another language. The computer is a very beneficail when ti comes to education. The computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple. It has come to be incorperated with almost any daily task that @MONTH1 occur during the day. It would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder. The computer is a technology that greatly benifits our communication, our entertainment, and even our education.	4	4	8
692	1	I don't think that computers is the most positive effect. Because most computer's are not like that the computers are not the smartest but it does help you when you need to do something like a project when you have to look for pictures and when you need help with math you can use the calculator on the computer but the computer does not help you on all your subject's the computer only help's you on a couple of your subject's that is the main reason I use the computer. Sometimes when I'm doing homework I let the computer do it for me so it is eaiser for me to do and I look for website's on it they give you really good website's that is why mostly everyone use's the computer they mostly use the comptuer to look for job's, car's, or a house that is what they mainly use the computer for most people do not like useing the internet because they think it's cheating to use the computer.	3	3	6
695	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons for my answer is that there are many homework helper websites, the computer helps you learn about places you've never been to, and you can even interact with people all around the world. These are my three reasons on why I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get tutored. I remember in @NUM1 grade when I had a math midterm. I was having a hard time understanding the math. Then, I went on a tutoring websites and they taught me everything that I was having trouble with. I think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades. This is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Second, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn about far away places that you have never been to before. This would be useful for a school project on a country. Also @PERCENT1 of students in my school say that the computer ha s helped them a lot on school projects. The computer could also be useful for planning a vacation. Would you want to vacation to a place that you know nothing about? That is where the computer can help. All you have to do is search your destination and pictures and info will come up so you can make the right choice. This is my second reason why I think omputers have a postive effect on people. Lastly, I think computer have a positive effect on people becuase you can interact with people around te world. I have a brothter that lives in florida, but I can talk to him every day on the computer. Also, I can keep in touch with my friends anytime I want. I think computers help people develop better social skills. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think computers have a postive effect on people for better grades, learn different things, and talk to friends.	5	4	9
706	1	Computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people learn about news in the world, places and people. Computers can also help people communicate with each other. Computers can also teach hand-eye cordination. People who support advances in technology, believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I whent on the computer and looked up @LOCATION2. It told me @LOCATION2 was located in @LOCATION1. Then it showed me a picture of @LOCATION2, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fasinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of whay they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper, on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world. Without computers people could not learn. On computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away. Scientist did a study on how people communicate. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 said they used a computer to comunicate with other people. People can use a webcam, aim, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or aim. Writing letters is to slow, on computer the other person your talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye cordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall. Computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports. Computer should be part of societys everyday life. Computer have a positive effect of people and they can help people learn new things, like, places, people, and news in the world. Computers are very benefital to society.	5	5	10
730	1	Dear Newspaper, The invention of the computer has made a great impact on society today. Although many people would look upon computers on a negative note, the computer allows us to do essential task needed in everyday life. Many people feel that the applications on a computer are @CAPS1 keeps us away from doing other productive activities, but the applications a computer holds is neccessary for must tasks. Apps suchn as  the calculater saves time from doing all the work on a piece of paper. It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than @NUM1 seconds. Its a great for finding how much a tip is, financial reasons such as now much you have to save, or even dung same basic math or science homework. Another great application is note taking that can easily be typed. This application allows you to take notes by typing, which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper. Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz. The most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet. The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons. If you plan to go to the movies tonight, the internet will surely give you movie times, directions, and how long the movie will be. It is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such. Considering this, the apps are very useful. The computer is also a great device to use for learning. It allows you to look online about new subjects such as far away places or people @CAPS1 would our country be line if we were not educated on the outside world around us? It is also a great learning technique for research. Our teachers today gives us many projects and assignments to learn about new things, and @CAPS1 a great way to research our topic than on the computer. The fashion of the @NUM2 and @DATE1 is just a project I did last month. The computer allowed me to find the garment both women and men wore, @CAPS1 material they were made from, and even now they managed to buy and get the material. The research from my computer gave me a great understanding on my topic and helped me to learned the basics of my topic. You would probably agree that communication can be used in negative ways, but communication is @CAPS1 keep our world spinning. The computer device is one of the many devices used for communication. Email on a computer allows you to send messages to a single or multiple people whatout the need of signal or service. Blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feeling on education on a certain topic. The instant message is probably the must used by teens. It is quick. It allows you to quickly talk a person without waiting, for reply for more than days. In conclusion, the computer is essential to our everyday life and without the computer, our people would not function!	5	5	10
738	1	Dear local newspaper, I feel very strong about my opinion of what effects computers have on people as in it helps others communicate with one another, give people info about different types of things, and make people smarter. To me that sounds like something with a positive effect, would you say? First of all, as some people say it doesnt let you interact with family members. Yes it truely does you can interact with both friends, and family members by going to chat rooms such as aim, meebo.web cam meeting such as skype.com. So that throw that concern out or the window you work have to worry about that. Secondly, you get to learn info about differnt types of things such as learning about wild animals any animal like a giraffe, cat, rat or learn about different places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION1 etc... Also you could find all of this info at home in one day. Most important I would make people smarter the computer teaches you hand eye corrdinations for free. The computer can teach you about any career, or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes, if needed? To conclude computers have positive effect on people, it lets people communicate with friends and family, you get to learn about different types of things, and it makes people smarter. Even I was done reading this it I thanked the lord for computer, it helps us so much.	3	3	6
740	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that children are spending to much time on the computer for the wrong reasons. I say this because all young children and teenagers want to do is get on to @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all day instead of reaserching and things like that. I have three reason's why I think going on the computer for the wrong reasons instead of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friend is a @CAPS5 first reason is because it is very dangerous and there are sometimes kidnappers on the chat room. @CAPS5 second reason is because their taking time away from trying to learn stuff off the internet. @CAPS5 final reason is because the interact influences violence. There are @CAPS5 three reason, on to here more. @CAPS5 reason number one why I say people are spending to much time on the internet is because it is dangerous. Young teenagers and children all enter a chat room online. Most of the time that is bad because kidnappers lie about their information so that you can meet up with them and then they take you away. So instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking on the daily news or searching like that. This is why I say that the internet is not alway good to be on all the time if you aren't or learning about the nation. @CAPS5 second reason why I that speding too much time on the computer all the great sometimes is its taking away from your come in the and go to the computer instead of doing their homework on reading. @CAPS6 like computer sometimes more than they like is learned and thats not good because not knowing I could if they got up their is on the computer for educational games but they dont. reason why I am concerned that people using the computer a lot. @CAPS5 final reason why I am concerned about people using the computer to much is because the internet on the computer can influence @CAPS6 to be violent in @CAPS5 ways all games and going on yo all the that affects the world if they keep seeing violence and things in that nature frequently. I say this because in this generation when they see violence it gives an image in more need and then @MONTH1 think its cool to do it because it @CAPS6 like @CAPS3 more than a book on the computer more than a look. When young teens see violence on the computer @MONTH1 think it's cool. This is @CAPS5 final reason why I was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer. So these one some of the main reasons why I say that the computer is not always a good because people spend a much time on them.	4	4	8
758	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I belive that people are spending to much time one computors. I belive this and I have @CAPS7 reasons why. @CAPS2 first reason is that people waste money on it. Also every thing they get from the computer you get from book. And finaly @CAPS2 reason is because of the ""@CAPS8 crises."" @CAPS2 first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it. I belive this because of your electric bill and and @CAPS3 bill. The people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity. This is also true becuse of the constant charging of laptops or running of computors. Also they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to keep the @CAPS3 connection. So that bocome a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going down the dawn. @CAPS2 second reason for this is that anything and every thing you can get on the @CAPS3 you can get from books. I belive this because where do you think the website makers get there info from. Reading books also increase your knoledge so that at any time you can quickly come up with an answer. Another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information. @CAPS2 third and final reason for this is that we are all dealing with this ""@CAPS8 crisis."" @CAPS7 people every day are getting less and less active because of computers. This I cause less people to be phisicaly active and less fit. And the @LOCATION1 is suffering because of it. Less and less people are joining the army because of this crises and computor are sadly con triputing to the world wide crisis. I eagerly hope that @CAPS2 letter hase helped you see @CAPS2 point of view on this subject. To show that people spend to much time on there computer because its a waste of money, anything you can get from a computor you can get from book, and because of the ""@CAPS8 crisis""."	4	4	8
763	1	To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on, todays society. People depend on them a lot but same people disagree. I think that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very entertaining. They can help find long lost friend and keep in contact with them. Plus they can be helpful with homework. Please proceed on reading to see as why I chose these resons. Firstly, computers can entertain. The are thousands of games to chose from. Dress up to educational. Which are good for young children of age five through six. As it states in the writing prompt it teaches hand-eye coordination. In addition to my first reason, computers help long lost friends. There are websites that help you find people. For example @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and yahoo. These websites help keep in touch to, with family. If theres no phone then theres always the computer. Lastly, computers can be helpful with homework. Sometimes you don't even need internet theres a calculator built right in! But a nationwide website thats used and children improve from it is edhelper.com. This website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on. In conclusion, I think that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, keeps in contact, and helpful with homework. Please take my reasons into consideration.	4	4	8
765	1	Dear editor, I beleve that people should have computers, The resons are it dosen't take @NUM1 days to email. You can learn about faraway places. Also you can talk to people around the world. After looking at these detail most people are likly to agree. Firstly it dosent take @NUM1 days to email you can email someone and it takes five seconds to get to the other person. While regular mail takes @NUM1 day to a week to get to another person. When you email some one and then the email you back it saves the and government money. Email is much fasters than the mall or I like to call it snail mail. Another reson is that you would be able to learn about diffrent contrys faraway and near. Would you be able to about @LOCATION1 from you living rooms without computers. No you wouldnt't. Without computers would you be able to learn about the earth quake in chile. No you wouldent. Compters are modern day telivision for kids. Lastly you can talk to people on the computer there is many ways to talk to people like facebook, myspace, aim, and vidio chat you don't have to call some one on the @CAPS1 when you can jus vidio chat with them. In conusion computers are good. You can email fast. You can learn about foreinge contrys in you living room. You can also chat with people online. I think computers are good what about you.	4	3	7
790	1	Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is helpful? It provides useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as for talking to friends. If there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can help you. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer! These are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, an @CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home this will. Make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to cant up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost @CAPS10 plan on earth. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone phone number but don't have a phone book you can use @CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can see that computers effect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can help in multiple ways. Having a computer could make you have draw perspective of everything.	5	4	9
801	1	Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 you might heard on the @ORGANIZATION1 new, more and more people thing computers are the benefits of society. I personally agree with them. I think that theyare making people missing out of new things, missing out of meeting new people, and looking out on exercize. Time flys by fast. Things can fly over your head and you might not notice them. Have you ever ben on a computer for an hour. It might have felt you were on for @NUM1 minets. Many people ben on it for a hole day. You could of missed a year of stuff. New things like the new ipod nano with camra be invend and you would of not known. Also, the ipod. You could down load books andd read them on there. There also new things to try like jumping art of a plain or bungy jumpimg. You could be going to new place around the world. Traveling to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 or even under water. Even going to @LOCATION2 and having a melting, warm, right of the oven tayst cheese pizza. My mouth is grulling for just thinking about it. How many people do you know. What about on facebook or myspace. @CAPS3 not you should go to the park. Meet some people. Just going to a family house, you can be interacting. Everyone should be interacting with someone. Even two year olds need to interact with other two year olds. Thats they learn how to share @CAPS2, your not two anymore but its good to know someone. Learning how others think too. You @MONTH1 think your way in good and the other erson way is not. Thats called interacting talking about it. @CAPS1 you might see on news how many familys have someone in the familys having weight problems. Meny shows like biggest losers @CAPS3 it chanels are trying to help these people lose weight. But what cams this? It could be not eating right, or not excresing right. But the problem could do with computers. Many people are spending @NUM2 mins on the computer, than @NUM3 excersising. Just a quick walk around the lock can make you lose at leat @NUM4 callories. Other might rather stay on the computer and gain @NUM4 callories. And some deaths are around by a heart attack. This @MONTH1 caused by plack billed up or weight going. In sted of reaching for an apple many americans reach for that foods. I think we should still use computers but cut down the rtimes we use it and exercise and eat more. You might think after reading this letter. Thinking people wont lisen about excersing and meeting new people or palces. But, the one thing we can do is to at least insire one person. That person can inspire another person. This can go on and on. Little by little we can help people what they can do with out using an computer.	4	5	9
804	1	Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have an people are not good. They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before.	4	4	8
854	1	"My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. ""But"" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!"	3	5	8
905	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I, a member of the public is writing a letter to you to inform you what I think about on the subject of if people spend to much time on the computer. My first idea is sometimes people do spend to much time on the computer than usual. Its a problem because some people began to become over wieght & start to lose control over the eating habits. My second idea is computers do alot of things for us. But there are still alot of things a computer cant teach us how to do. So computers are helpful but they're not always find something to do outside but whats sometimes different with a computer. My last & final idea is people become to attached to their computers & lose sight of what really matter, such as exercising & fitnesss. Then people are angry when their computer chrashes & forget how to do things because their always on the computer. And those are my ideas on the subject about if people spend to much time on the computer but not as much time with friends and family.	3	3	6
912	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers were invented they have grown so much, which make a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people use them more. More and More people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who suffort advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but there are negative effects too. I believe that computers are a negative effect on people vecause people spend too much time on computer; not exercising, there are many dangers, and less interacting with family and friends. First @ORGANIZATION1 all, a negative effect computers have on people is that they spend too much time on the computer and that leads to less exercise. Recently, @CAPS3 spoke to a local @CAPS2 about this issue and she spoke out, @CAPS3 have one family computer and my son is the one who is always on it right after school to late at night."" This shows that many children are on a computer too much. I have to input that I personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours past. I try to cut back on my computer times, but it doesn't really work out. Sitting on the computer for hours everyday is also looking exercise. The hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising. someone's health is very important now. Spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people. Secondly, the most concern parents have @ORGANIZATION1 computers are the many dangers, which is another negative effect it has on people. Recently the new biggest site is facebook. So many people are addicted to it. Though, it isn't that safe all the time. Another new thing is oovoo or skype, which allows you to talk to someone with webcam. There could be a time when a teen ""meets"" someone on-line and agree to do things on the webcam for someone they don't really know to see. These sites aren't safe, and knowing youngs they can in danger. @CAPS3 spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are @PERCENT1 dangerous to young teens. All these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people. Lastly, another negative effect computers have on people is there is less interactions with family and friends. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 getting together with a friend people just go on the computer to talk. That isn't the same as an actual get together. I actually enjoy family parties. Seeing all my aunts, uncles, and cousins it so much better and fun. I do e-mail my family and friends when I don't see them, but I get excited when @CAPS3 have get togethers. Now a day it's not like that for a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people. Many people work long times and spend too much time on the computer, which takes time away from interacting with others, and that should be more important. The computer also, negatively effects people with interacting with family and friends. In conclusion, I see computers as a negative effect on people. Computers make people spend a lot @ORGANIZATION1 time have dangerous risks, and take away interaction time. I strongly suggest you look over my terms."""	5	5	10
915	1	"Do computers really benifit society? This has been a tricky question for years. Some people say computers are a huge help and it allows us to see the world through a different perspective; we learn more from computers and this vast increase in tecknology. Though others say computers are addicting, it is the @CAPS2 unsafe and unsecure machine to be using especially when it is left a lot of personal files on it while hooked up to the internet. Plus people spend more time on a computer than ever, missing out on thier families and friends, not being able to enjoy nature and the other simple things in life. Besides, if you want my honest opinion, computers should only be used as tools. ""The fact is many people look to computers as personal diaries or something to save files on or even something to play games on,"" says @PERSON2. ""They ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier."" This is really what computers are made to do, help us. It could be as simple as a @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or as complexed as a super computer but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier. Even if you tried to upgrade a computer it would still serve the same purpose, yet people still look on it as if it were still the next big thing in entertainment. Many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life. Ever since @PERSON1 made @ORGANIZATION2 the @CAPS2 popular disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 around, people have been using computers alot. Its not because he created the fastest computer ever. It is because @ORGANIZATION2 is selling world wide; for buisnesses, small companies, schools, even in entertainment. A few years ago they made something called the xbox @NUM1. It revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming. But whats the problem here? The problem is that because of @ORGANIZATION2 people are now more addicted to entertainment. When this happens people will start becoming dependent on a computer. Its not that @ORGANIZATION2 did anything bad but the fact that since @CAPS2 computers have internet, those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse getting all their information stolen. There is this one thing about computers that remains constant. Family and friends will find it hard to talk to there loved one when they spend all there time on computers. This makes comunication hard, and like I said before its very addicting. ""@CAPS2 of the people who don't have real friends will chat with people online not knowing who they really are."" says @CAPS3 @PERSON3. Making friends online is the @CAPS2 unsafe thing to do on a computer. Over @PERCENT1 of the people online are not who they say they are and people will often break away from thier real friends just to find this new ""friend"" they've made. So remember, even though computers are"	5	5	10
916	1	"Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1's the dillemant @CAPS2 that people are supporting computer technology and others are not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them everyday and it is very efficiant for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games, @CAPS3 effect that computers have is educational websites; games, and articals. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job. Primarily. computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as @ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide sarely for people all around the united states and other parts of the world. My father always told me, ""Computers save people everyday"". Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, @LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacherm. Mr, @CAPS4 his computer every single movning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purposed fealuired. Would you want all those people to lose ther job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't, @CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This is things like staying in town with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could ne relaxing to almost anyone. @CAPS6 is an example of keeping in town with someone else. For me, @CAPS6 is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website live @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my @CAPS6 deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give aduts and kids tree access to education. I remenber my old elementery school used to play many amusing math games. These were @CAPS5 my education grew greatly dae to this game. Games as these are used frecquently thoughout the world. In addition jobs have been lost from this had economy. However, jobs we hering found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers, computers are a good idea To conclude. I imploor you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student. for they are very important. Jobs use them everyday, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why the technology or computers effects people in a good way."	6	5	11
943	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home make it easer. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I don’t know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topc for school there is always an endless library of information @CAPS6 you turn on the computer. You @CAPS7 get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time, to get to a local library. Also, @CAPS6 you have a project in school that you need to type, it is helpful to have a computer at home so you don't have to use at short. This way, you have more time to get extra from teachers @CAPS3 on instrument in the school band. I can imagine that my grades would be @CAPS6 i did have access to the internet of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 at home. Have you over pare or document and had an of her and happens @CAPS6 you own a computer you can backup @CAPS7 you imagine on essay five pages and organized is boring, biut you wouldn't think so @CAPS6 it saved you from hours worth of writing! For some people, having a computer @CAPS7 make you money, and who wouldn't like more money? You can run a business online and avoid the hastle of manting a @CAPS8 your own space or building to run your business can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, you can refrain from making a trip from the store by purchasing items online. Then, the item will be shipped to your door. You save time and money on gas by doing so. And thise days, any way to save money is a good one! By having a computer you can boost your education.Keep yourself organized, and save money. Although it has many recreational purposes as well, it also can be very helpful in your life. And besides, is perfectly fine, to go online to talk to your friends once in a while, isn't it?	4	5	9
953	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 the world having a network where people can connect, learn and work efficently. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help @CAPS3 connect with far-away places, develop hand-eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area. @CAPS2 being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world, unable to enjoy the beauty of @LOCATION3 or send help to the starving people in @LOCATION2. @PERCENT1 of money donated to @ORGANIZATION1 an organization that assists in global disasters comes from online. Without the computer how would our willing people help the rest of the world, or even know about the rest of the world? Give our community the ability to reach out to the farthest parts of the globe, give them computers. Computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else. Playing baseball simply doesn't require enough focus. The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand-eye coordination that could save lives. @PERSON1, who trains the @CAPS3 air force weighs in on the effects of computers. ""They have made a great deal of positive impact."" he states. ""@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots."" @CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well? The computers we own train @CAPS3 as we use them to have reflexes and hand-eye coordination equal to the best of the military. Computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster. Before computers @CAPS7 and calculating took @PERCENT2 more time but now they get our work done quickly and without error. @NUM1 year old author @PERSON2 states ""@CAPS4 computer helps me type @CAPS4 writing a lot faster and it is done right more importantly."" @CAPS7 and typing is just more efficent when you are using a computer accountants, students and even the journalists for your own newspaper need the computer to work faster and more efficently. Don't stunt our community's workers, give them what they need computers! Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. Our community benefits from the computers that help @CAPS3 connect with far away places, give @CAPS3 hand-eye coordination and help @CAPS3 work quickly and correctly. So explain in your next article that we need our computers. Computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them!"	6	6	12
961	1	Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negitive or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising littele time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only away from that kids well be on facebook instant of eating a nice meal with thier family. My @CAPS2 always told me stays of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now wkids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it ells you where go. What happens when it braker? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must streach the negative affect of computers to. 	4	4	8
963	1	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers, alot of teens spend alot of time on computers, I also think this from my own experience and I surveyed @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class. I would first like to expand my idea of teens spend alot of time on the computer, some teens go on the internet and do homework or might check their emails others go on @CAPS1 for hours and got addicted, so they're not outside or doing sports. In my own experience I used to have a @CAPS1 and I woud be at it for the whole day and I woud miss out on hanging with my family and friends. So I deleted the account. But, I still feel addicted to the computer I'm always listening to music or chating with my friends or checking my emails like most people The things* And lastly else to @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of people a day on it, @PERCENT2 said that they spend @PERCENT3 of people. That they now go on the computer. These that just one @NUM1 grade class most students are addicted to it.* no matter what age. This is why I believe that people do spend to much time or the. Many students go on @CAPS1 for hours at a time and in my own experience I have been addicted to the comp. and @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class when I surveyed them there ans a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer. So parents please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer.	4	4	8
970	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society is much more different from what it was like twenty years ago. We have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please just like a computer. Our access to such a large network beings us together, can broaden mental horisons and keep many @CAPS5 hard workers on key point so that when time for work comes around, they are ready. Not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing well, but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms. Our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons. They vigorously build sley scraping towers, educational fucilities, additions to our health center, and even the very places we call home. However, when weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazzardous in the long run, they must still ramain at the ready when duty calls. Lately, there has been an advancement in technology to help chane opperators maintain their skills during their of season vistually. It @MONTH1 appear easy to the untrained spectation. To one it @MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a pull a few levers, and push a few buttons. However, there is in fact a persition to such a task. Pull the lever to quickly and the crane can go sharply in the wrong direction causing it to tip over. One of feild reponters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a @CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs at our builders. That just goes to show that @CAPS5 one does not keep such skill in check, they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site. I, personally, find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, @CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home, my studies would be near impossible. With @DATE1's economy going to a class outside & school, or even hiring a personal tutor, can be enough to effect anyones budget emensly. The internet provides an efficient low casting, or even free, way to help any language learner. One can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language. In @DATE1's society not everyone has the time to go to he library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in. Some @MONTH1 say that asking a neighbor about their home canbe just as afective, but that can awkward for those that don't particulary do well in face to face setting. However, havbing a complete at hand can make learning an enjoyabl experience. Once can find blog posts about someone's visti to there country of interest & even videos of their time there. Websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful. On the other hand, @CAPS5 someone were to be looking for and acception vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can be found as well. Some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive. One @MONTH1 have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives. Social networks on the web makes connecting with lvoe ones easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean. I hope that everything I have fare travel can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find way benefits to technological advances. Please do remember that technology can serve as a skill maintenance tool, educational, and as a connection for our foreign born citizens. Thank you for	5	6	11
977	1	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion is yes people are on the computer to much. I have @NUM1 good reason why I think people are on the computer a lot. @CAPS1 first reason is people are losing time. Second not that much engry. Third you just spending your life on the computer keep on reading why I don't agree that it befits society to people. People losing time to have fun. They do have any time for friends family, pets, and scuh more. It mostly adicaution to go on website like facebook, myspace, @CAPS2, and such more people just need to get off the computer and have fun outside. Mostly people dont really get that much engry. Some people are always inside they just need engry. Fresh our will help that maybe going to the gym or jog outside for a while. Being inside isnt really good for you. Just being inside just make you kinda gang weight. And then you wouldn't have anytime with your friends, and more only if your inside like always. Fineally you spend all your time at home being computer. And you don't have anytime, engry and such more. YOu spend all your time inside computer cool technology but you don't need to be on it @NUM2. You just have time for friends and family. Now you know @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benfit society. People are losing time and everything. People dont have anymore engry. And your spend all your time on the computer. Bye for now.	3	4	7
985	1	"Dear @CAPS1, "" Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me, i can't live without a computer."" @CAPS2 my many local in the town of @LOCATION1. For me, computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications. But they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine. I also think tha computer is important because it is where businessmen do their job. My favorite part about the computer are applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps. are great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state, @CAPS3. Easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and so many other endless possibilities, You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very fun to do things on the computer that you enjoy, and not have to research all the time. The second thing on the computer, is research. Researching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, But researching is educational, and I asked a mother with a @NUM1 year old, a @NUM2 year-old, and a @NUM3 yearl-old and she said ""The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. Its's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The best thing about researching is that, there are endless amounts of websitees that have information for us to look at, and enjoy. People that work and have jobs, are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them ar researching while working. People that work, are th ones that are basically on the computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc.... The computers are mostly used by workers for e-mail. My father is always on the computer, checking e-mails, typing something for this boss; and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because foe some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, they'are one of the best things created. They are the best because they ahve amazing apps. for me to have fun on. But they also provide an educational opportunity through research. And they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person that can live without one of these technological beauties."	4	5	9
1007	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers these days have made positive changes to all of our every day lives. People have made beter connections with family and friends, and even have the ability to make new ones. While social networks are great and all, computers can also make work extremely easy and proffesional-looking. They can also perfect the skill of hand-eye coordination. But with that in mind, is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are. Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @CAPS1. I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made, and friends have been reunited. And reuniting friends, you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button. Isn't making more friends and reconnecting so easy now? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from @ORGANIZATION2 that can make making slideshows, projects, and reports far easier. I remember making a @CAPS2 with my best friend back when we were in @NUM1 grade. All we did was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then we added captions to all of the pictures. We did an amazing, professional job on the project and received an A-. Though I understand that in the process of computer-usage, people hardly find time outdoors, the technological advance will enhance hand-eye coordination. Imagine this: You're up at bat in a baseball game. @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls is your count. Everyone is cheering you on. The pitcher pitches the ball and wham! You swing that bat and hit yourself a homerun! Do you know what skill was used to hit that ball? That's right - hand-eye coordination. So now while everyone is wondering what sort of effect the computer has, remember how easy that work was for me. Also think back to that baseball player. You know, the one that hit the homerun using hand-eye coordination. But most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you. The computer is a positive advance in society, and everyone should be assured so!	5	5	10
1013	1	I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day.	3	4	7
1042	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I took a poll of @NUM1 people and @PERCENT1 of them agree computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place, teach people hand-eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. Using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. Some of the ways I keep in touch with them are e-mailing, video chating, and instant messaging. Some other good things about talking to people online is if you're talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. Another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand-eye coordination. The ways of teaching this are typing, and clicking on something, @CAPS1 people, when they type, look at the keyboard. But, with pratice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. To click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. That, believe it or not, is hand-eye coordination. One last reason computers are good at helping people is it a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. Another option is , say someone is going on a vacition to @LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it. They can go on the internet and get information on @LOCATION1 with just a couple clicks of the mouse. Finally, say someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 for fun: They type @ORGANIZATION2 in look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. In conclusion, I deffinately think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons I have stated. People can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand-eye coordination, and finially, people can look a person or place up using the internet. This is my opinion on computers, I hope you agree.	4	4	8
1092	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. ""You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond. (did not finish)"	5	5	10
1109	1	Dear Newspaper, Computers benefit society because they teach people. They are also helpful because they solve problem that humans might have trouble with. They can also entertain us when we have nothing to do. They can teach people many things. They can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to. Actually @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 tourist research the area there going to on a computer. They help students catch up or fully understand something. One time I was having trouble with fraction, in math. So I decided to look up the way to find the answer and it caught me up with the class again. The computer can explain cultures from any where in the world. According to culture digest.com @PERCENT1 of people visiting a new country. Find out about the culture first. Computers solve problems that some people might not now about. It can solve a math problems easily with a built in calculator. @NUM3 out @NUM4 computer users have used calculator to help them solve a problem. They also solve geographic problems. There @MONTH1 be an about of date map but this is easily solved with live satelite maps. Map tools says there has never been a flaw in their system. Computers have a wide viarety of entertainment. They can play music. @PERCENT2 of teens get there music from the computer over a cd. Computers can entertain you with games. One day it was raining hard and I had nothing to do so I went on my computer and played minesweeper. This kept me very entertained. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for time.	4	4	8
1130	1	Dear Newspaper I disagree with the hole computer thing I think it's just a wast of money and it's a wast of time for kids. That will be the kids will get fat and kids will never want to go out side they will want to play video games, eat junk food. If you stay on the computer for to long, it can make your eyes week and it sometimes can give you canser and you can die from canser or you can get really sick and not die and you will hike @NUM1 sick year of pain. Mostly kids stay on the computer for mores playing stupid games and they will never go out side and they will stay in side for days and never go out side and play with there friends. When they get sick of there games they will want to try and hang out with there friends but they wont be able to they will be to fat and slow. My aunt died from useing a computer to much she had brain cancer and she died she lived for @NUM2 year with the cacer. I felt so bad for my cousin he had to watch his mother die all because she used a computer everyday cause that has her job. Therefor I state that computers should not be used for more than @NUM2 houre a day	3	3	6
1134	1	Dear sir, I belive that computers are great for society. There are lots of benefits to having a computer to use. You can talk to people online with instant message, it is a lot more dependable than a telephone or cell phones. Lots of time people don't answer thhe phone when you need them. With a computer you can send a message from the computer to the persons cellular device. You can lern a lot from a computer, suc as things about the world, people around the world, yo can lern things from the internet youre teacher can't even teach you. Then you can study and expand youre knolage. It is a problem if your on the computer more than you exersize but with techology today you can get exersize wile useing a computer. You can play music from it while you workout, of what moivie while running on a tredmill. Even though people go on the computer to much ways to exersize and use the computer at the same time. So there is ups and downs but in the end, it dosen't matter how much you use the computer, you can get exersize at the same time thats why I think it is a benifits to have computers today.	3	3	6
1160	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things, you can also find a relitive you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends, another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's and other devices. My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us alot of things. If you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things on on the computer you can look it up and find out. Another is you can find a family member you haven't seen in along time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer. Also alot of people @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again they cannot find them and fill close to them again. And they can find you if they relly need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friends releaves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and alot of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers their's no point of music. In conclusion I think computers have a good effect on people.	4	4	8
1168	1	"Dear, newspaper writer I think the computer has a posative effect of people because @CAPS1 helps people around the world learn to speak a different language, @CAPS1 helps people talk to their friends around the world and @CAPS1 helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to write a letter and send @CAPS1 out to people they work for or to their bosses that need the report in by the end of the day. Those are the three reason that computers have a posative effect. @CAPS1 helps people learn to speak a different language without spending a lot of money like using rosetta stone you have to spend @NUM1 us dollars but online you dont have to spend a dime. the best part is that @CAPS1 is free. The slogan for rosetta stone is ""I have spent less money than months of formal classes."" I think their new slogan should be is "" we have a better learning company than anyone else."" That is why @CAPS1 helps people learn a different language. @CAPS1 also helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to talk to their friends you can aim, web cast, and ever text to make @CAPS1 easier @CAPS1 talk to friends on the internet. The reason they created that is so people dont have to travel to far away places and spend money to tell a friend important news that is only one thing. So in conclusion you dont have to spend a lot of money to tell a friend something. The third reason that the computer helps people is that people san e mail theor boss that they are faxing their final repoet to the big interview for a new position in the place where they work, @CAPS1 helps your boss by making @CAPS1 easier to read and @CAPS1 better because you could be in japan and your boss could be in florida @CAPS1 will take like @NUM2 minutes to get to your bosses computer. That is why @CAPS1 is easier to send messages to your boss. The three main reasons are that you can learn a different language without paying a dime that you can talk to your friends easier and that you can send messages to your boss easier that calling him or her. Those are the three reasons that computers are posative."	4	4	8
1176	1	Dear newspaper I hear the more and more people use computers and I think thats so awesome because people talk online with other people. @CAPS5 they teach you how to use a computer. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Computers it the more advanced technology so its @CAPS1 the people is using it. I love to be in the computer all day because I always enter to @CAPS2 and talk online. @CAPS4 example some people like to talk with a family member the is not in the @LOCATION1 so they communicate from the computer. Sometimes I talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2 because I have @NUM1 years I dont see her. So I think talk online or using the computer is important. @CAPS4 example even grandma have @CAPS3 and she talks online with her family members. I think the using the computer is not a bad benefit because it helps you be in communication with your family or friends. That is why I think the people is wrong saying the or is not. Secondly, it teach you hand-eye coordination my grandma is old but computer and @CAPS4 example my grandma a nice hand eye coordination because when she goes to the letters she just ress and all she is correct. think computers have a effect on people. It @CAPS5 helps people write better and better. @CAPS4 example I love and when it write I dont need to go to other I write king of @CAPS5 the helps me with my eye and hand @CAPS6 is the it helps you find faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example on @ORGANIZATION1 you find what ever street you want. It @CAPS5 help you find in the computer about people. @CAPS4 example if I have a project I find the information on @ORGANIZATION1 about people or places. The computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people. I think is a positive effect on people. Finally, I think the computers are great benefits society. One reason is the you could talk online with people. @CAPS5 it teach you hand-eye and the helps your brain and sight. It @CAPS5 helps you at your hand movements. @CAPS6 reason is the give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example I have a project in @CAPS7 and I have to learn and search about forensic doctor and I search everything on the computer. I think the computers help your brain think more and computers are advanced technology. So I think their benefits our society.	4	4	8
1183	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think Computers have a bad effect on people for three reasons. One they can really hurt your eyes, two it is not safe if you have little kids in your house. Finaully three you will never see your family or friends if your on the computer. The first reason was computers have a bad effect on people is it can really hurt your eyes. If your always stareing at a computer screen all the time you can go blind. And with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes. The second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home. Like you can be watching adult movie that little kids are'nt aged enough to see if can have a bad effect And it has a bad effect on people because you will have no and if you have a little kid in your house he will always be in and he will probaly hear something really, really kid like music, @CAPS3 if you have a kid house The reason was computers have bad effects on people is that if your always on a computer you will never see your family and @CAPS3 if you are always on the computers you will miss out on the And will never you never see and don't @CAPS3 a rent on on the computers. @CAPS3 what you look And keep the little kid with you in the house. And last get off the computer and go see your family and friends. 	4	4	8
1214	1	Dear @PERSON1, Computers are necessary and benefit our community. They do a great deal to help make our lives easier. There is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another. The benefits of our computers are they connect us, the spread news, and they make every day objects work. Computers connect us in so many difffrent ways. Where would businesses be without computers? Most modern day businesses are run by computers. Owners can now have businesses all over the world. With computers a business in @LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @LOCATION1. They can have live video chats together. With the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world. Even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers. Now a days we do a lot of online shopping. This is an example of how stores connect to their customers. Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations. This can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop. The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. With all these computers many social networking sites are born. The most popular right now is @CAPS1. Students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries. We have a live chat on @CAPS1 or even @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is instant messging which is, well, instant. With a simple click people are connected no matter how far apart they are. Therefore, computers conect people. Computers also broadcast news. Without the computers most of us would not no about world news. This includes the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 they would be in alot more trouble. They would not have all of these donations. Also computers even broadcast national news. Almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too. Anyday now they will be completly online. This will drastically change how we learn about news. It would just be a click away. What would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds. Science also benefits from computers. Phones now can be personal tws, inernet, and messaging devises. Phones are just a tiny version of a computer. Cars also have computers put into them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Also, in cars there are computers to run just about everything else. So, there is not a day where we do not incounter computers. In conclusion, computers benefit us in so many ways. They conect us deliver news, and are in almost all of our technology. Could you imagine life without computers?	5	5	10
1231	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have good effects on people such as letting people talkto family or friends that live faraway. Computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world. My first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world. This helps you if you are going on vacation to foreign country you can learn where the test historical sights are and you can also learn where the best hotels are. If you have a project due on a foreign country you can search it up and it will give you all the data you need about it. My second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live faraway. This helps you keep in touch so it doesn't seem like you don't know them any more. Computers can also let you talk to your friends that live faraway and if you want to hangout it would let you talk about which days are good for you and them.	3	3	6
1243	1	Dear all computer lovers, i do think you are all spending too much time on the computer. yes, it is good to go on the computer and learn new fact, watch funny videos, and also basicly everything is on the computer these days. But most people spend to much time on the computer. you need to be doing three things, enjoy nature spending time with family and friends and most importantly, exercise. In this letter I will be explaing why you need these things, wich you cant get on the computer. First, i will be explainig why it is important to enjoy nature. Sometimes, enjoying nature can be difficult but if we all look closer it can be really fun. Some examples of nature are trees, grass, the fresh air. But I am sure all of my fellow teenagers would agree that, that is very boring we would all rather sit and watch tv. Some examples of making of making nature fun is instead of looking at a boring tree, you can climb the tree and maybe you can go outside and play with your dog and lay in the grass. One example of my favorite things to do in nature, is when I say up all night I run outside very early and lay in the grass, breathe in the fresh air and watch the sun came up. Secondly, and every importanrt that you get off the computer and spend time with family and friends. Fa mily, can do @MONTH1 things with you and I know that I am very happy when I am with family because they always make me laugh and most importantly my family loves to party. Partys are always fun ecspecially when your are with family. Freinds are also great to be with because they make you laugh have adventures and are always there for you.	5	4	9
1247	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, ect. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloose you to draw or biuld. I bet the even help young children became smarter by biulding things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad econimy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and bretheing you can find broken bones or tomors, you can biuld briges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most importen and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camra for or save a life by fing were they crased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter.	4	4	8
1253	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers are bad because you will be wonign to do no homework because people are playing to much computers and they are getting aditivf to the computers and it is dayise because you mit be talking to people that you don't now on thr computer and it is the vary dagis because it is the sam thing as haveing a myspace on teh computer it is vaery dangish because ther are dad people that be going on the computer and people be pating bad stuf on the computer.	2	2	4
1256	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 the world has changed so much, for the better. Technology has become so advanced, there are new cures for for different diseases. Computers are one of these great benefits. They let you communicate quicker. You can keep up with family members and old friends. You can also talk to different people who live in another state, country, or continent. These a quote that says ""communication is key."" I'll put that into more details in my next paragraph. I remember one time long ago, the only way to communicate was by letters or you would have to walk. Now wih computers with just one email or an instant message. Someone can get your messgae in. By sending a letter it can take a while. Even if you and call some one they @MONTH1 not be home or answer. But you can get emails and instant message ways. It also doesn't cost to send long distnace. Which will be bring yo my next topic. A profressor at @ORGANIZATION2 once said ""Computers are taking time "" But, if you think about it what it's actually doing is reconnecting with family members and old friends. For example, you @MONTH1 move and not be able to see them again. Then, you get a new phone number and forget other people number. If you have a computer you go on this great social networking side called where you look up some old friends name and distant realtives and you find out that it's really them. Than they you to other family members and before you know it you all to other again. Now, I'll bring to you my @DATE1 topic. The world wide web is a big place were peolple from all over the. On the world wide web you can meet some new people who not live in your state, or country. But, you find that you are starting to click when you meet this person they @MONTH1 be of a different rare. Thats ok you can learn new thing about a different cuture. While you two @MONTH1 have something in common you can share other things you like to do which you can try, so you're learning something new while having fun at the same time. Now you'll see it's time you get a computer rather than never have the experience. With a computer you can communcate quicker. You can reconnect with distant relatives and old friends. You can also talk to different people who like you."	4	4	8
1257	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you dont even need a keyboard. Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. We'll computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the vireses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parcore. Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They to, might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a buisness that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more.If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us suesede is great.	5	4	9
1260	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in the @NUM1 grade in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 In @LOCATION1. I'm writing to you because I heard that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In @CAPS1 opinion I think it benfit society. If you keep reading I will fell why it benif society. @CAPS1 first reason that computer have a positive effect on people. For example, when I see @CAPS1 older brother go on the computer he look much smarter on it. That @NUM2 out of @NUM3 member of @CAPS1 family learn thing from the computer. @CAPS1 second reason that it teach hand eye coordination. For example, when I play games in the computer @CAPS1 hand are the ones doing every thing for me. (@PERSON1 example is that we I wacth the game @CAPS1 hand are roating) @CAPS7 @NUM4 of @NUM3 of human play games in the computer and let their hand do everything. @CAPS1 third reason that it give people the ability to learn. For example, when I was using the computer use too teach so much that I'm go on most of the time. @NUM6 of @NUM3 student study in computers and they learn about thing that they never knew. Also they have the ability learn more on the computer. Some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer. However, I said that computer help people learn about thing that happen in the word. For example, they could larn about the war that going on and how people are risking their life for this cause. In conclusion, In @CAPS1 opinion it benefit society. Computer have a positive effet, I theach hand eye, and it give people the ability to learn. I think you should put all you support in the problem.	4	4	8
1271	1	The computer is a great achivement of man. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other capabilities. Even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world. It has negatively afect to people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Along with that they are being socialy active. The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people. It would be great if some how the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should wont to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just dont let computers control your life.	4	4	8
1273	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chating on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative, so in aim a problem I still have yet to find out. I asked question like ""what do you do at home?"", ""are you a computer geek?"". (@CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a comcast commercial) and some who don't know what a computer is (not commenting). I am here to teach about the benifits of exercising and not the un natural ways of a computer. Did you know people can loose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse dont believe me try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get , give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick for example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorsed the depression effected his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1 @CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infecte and could have ended his life. I believe this was from lacks of communication and this happens everyday to everyone just open your eyes and relise what a computer can do to a man or woman. (@CAPS5 was remaried to bonnie and now carrys a scars on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many, do people spend to much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neibor see what they think. I relly hope you consider my argument."	5	5	10
1293	1	Dear local news papers, I'm writing to tell you that people on the computer is not a bad thing. Would you enjoy being bord? Or to enter tained while learning something? Being on the computer helps with hand eye coordination, you can learn about amazing places, and even talk friends. Hand eye cordination is good because it good. Save millions of people in war for example my grandpa went into the @ORGANIZATION1 and @NUM1 people were firing at him but he had good hand eye cordination from the computer go it saved his life less people will get hurt like getting your hand gramed in the car door. There would be more to do. The more something just as important as hand eye cordination is learning! On the internet you can learn about anything and everything. if you learn about far away places you will be able to widen your conversation people will think your smarter and you'll feel good, not only what other people think you sin truelly get smarter. Most importantly you can talk to friends! If you are taking so your friends it can build up your self asteam and when you go to school you'll social did you know @PERCENT1 of people do better in school if they comunicate online? Don't you wish every day you could be proud of your self? Well talking online helps! This is why im writing to you to share all my ideas and concerns. I hope you concider them and share them with the rest of the world.	4	3	7
1296	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have some opinions on technology is going these days and about how many people shun the idea of further advancement for the understandable reasons that it brings people away from family and that it draws people's attention away from the rest of the world I do see their point but I'd like to make a point myself. While statistics show a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities people also find more things to do and now that the world is more concerneD for the environment you will probably see people coming outside again because they heard about some new environmental actavist group to join or they watch a movie that makes fun of live action role playing and decide to give it a whirl. My point being that you never know what your going to discover in the media and its better than sitting outside all day with no insperation, waiting for your parents to get home and give you information from outside you tiny world. The other item I will mention is the music industry and how it is revolutionized with more advanced, and different ways of listening to it in fact the only problem in music today are the artist and how they take advantage of recording studies and on occasion another just to gain fame! Without doing anything but sit back and lip sync. But the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now. So why not advance and invest in the music industry, it will provide entertainment and fun for years to come. Advanceing technology is the music industry actually is probably good for the economey as well I mean if we didn'@CAPS4 have new @CAPS3 to bell to people every year that would be a huge decline in stock market prices not that were not in a crash right now but it wouldn'@CAPS4 be any better. That goes for cell phones too and any other piece of hardware that gets frequently upgraded it's just good for buisness. You see I belive that the point of life is joy so whats better than settling down with mabey a date some candlelight and a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V most people will enjoy just sitting down and watching the telly it's easy to relate to. The television has evolved in many good ways it's a way to lay down and unwind learn about so many different things mabey watch a show on @LOCATION1 it makes you feel like being there without actually being there. I helps us get updated on current events shows things that we want to do and shows us how to do it. I for example have learned so much from.	5	4	9
1297	1	Dear @CAPS1-republican, @CAPS2 do benifit society in a positive way, but they also have a negative affect. Computers allow people to chat/voice chat/video chat with family members in other countries that would be very expensive or impossible over the phone. They also provide learning experiences with many resources at your finger tips. One posotive affect of computers is that they allow you to connect with people around the world. Programs like skype and allow you to video/voice/ chat to people around the world at no cost. Doing such the phone would be very expensive. It gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see. Another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides too you. The internet has just about every piece of information possible. Doing a research paper go to wikipedia and topics you'l find information. The internet can prove to be helpful. The @CAPS2 offers you many good mind/puzzle games that you could not ordinarily do. There are alot ;of good things on the internet. Many things that help get your mind flowing. Cant afford the newspaper? Read articles and stories right on the internet. The last reason I believe @CAPS2 have a positive affect on people is because it replace. Many people, instead of going to the @CAPS3 will go to the @CAPS2. No matter what are you doing, you are usually doing more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1. That is why I think computers make a posotive affect on people. Computers are sure to be our future. You can play games, voice/video chat and even read the newspaper.	4	4	8
1303	1	"Dear Local Newspaper On the subject of computers; Their pros and cons, I would have to say that both sides provide veru important reasons why you should and shouldn't use computers, I think that computers are very important to many students just like me. First of all computers help me and my fellow classmates with many asisgnmenrs. Some of us simply don't have the time to go to a library and look for a book that might nit even posses the information needed. On the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more! It also helps to develop your hand-eye coordination some peopel say ""you can learn hand-eye coordiantion outside too? Although that is true, typing is very fats and neat. As you can see my hand wriitng is not the best but I type very fast and make little mistakes so I do not need the neatest hand writing ever.The way I see it computers are the fastert way of doing alot of things. So if you spend time writign neatly you might nit even be able to go outside and see nature. my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers. Sometime the easy way isn;'t always the best way thats why we must have balance. Do not infrom people to stop using computers but to balance thier time with them. Everything is good if it's balanced. for example, coffiene, In large amounts it is rather unhealthy but when you need a small you turn to caffiene and it helpd, same with computers. Besides, computers are now made everwhere, trying to get rid of them is simply unreasonable. We are already in a recession we dont need more trouble. I prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative. So you see comuters are evry helpful to some balance is the answer!"	3	4	7
1326	1	"Dear trained readers, @CAPS1't you agree that more and more people use computers. Well I @CAPS2 because it gives us the information we want to see. Recently it has been brought to my attention that some people agree that some people @CAPS3 themselves don't really use computers. Without a dout I firmly believe that people that dont use computers should start to use them. but I can understand why same people don't use computers. Maybe they dont know how to use one have better things to @CAPS2, or can't afford one. First of @CAPS5, they dont know how to use one. I remember when my friend was over and I was on a computer. and he @CAPS4 ""@CAPS2 you know that some people don't know how to use an computer?"" And I @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 who?"" the @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 me, I dont know to use one."" I @CAPS4 well I'll teach you. Since then @CAPS5 my friend does is go on the computer. One day he says to me because of I want to work with computers. this is one of my reasons why people don't use computers. Second of @CAPS5, have better things to @CAPS2. @MONTH1 be someone has a game. for example, I mostly have how time to go on the computer. Usually I have a basketball game or practice I get home from practice and feel exhausled, @CAPS5 I want to @CAPS2 is go to @CAPS6. why parents come have not wanting to @CAPS2 anything. I'll tell you why. Because @CAPS5 that haved They @CAPS2 @CAPS5 day. This is another one of my reasons why people dont use computers. Third of @CAPS5 can't afford one. Some people dont have a lot of money to buy a computer. They have to say it. so they can live in a house. When parent's children asle for something parents shoudn't buy it. They buy it so you dont feel hurt. When I'm a @CAPS7 im going to make sure I have enough money to buy it. If not then I guess that child is out of luck. So dont be going where bragging your computer because some can't afford one. This is my last reason why people don't use computers. this is why some people don't use computers now in days. Because they dont know how to use one, have something better to @CAPS2 and can't afford one. By the way; @PERCENT1 of the pupils of @ORGANIZATION1 dont have computers."	4	4	8
1333	1	Do you think computers are handy? I do believe they are very handy. Computers offer many things like Online shopping, @CAPS1 and even @CAPS2.V. Online shopping can be very helpful. Say you don’@CAPS2 have a car. Well you can go online and buy whatever you need at the store. People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games. You can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping. That is why I think computers are helpful. Chatting on the computer is great. Now facebook, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate the @CAPS15. On @CAPS6 you can follow famous people like @PERSON1 the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receicer. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people accounts. Chatting become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. you @MONTH1 believe its pointless but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer. This is also easier when maybe your in the car for a long road trip then you turn on your laptop and watch any show you @MONTH1 went @CAPS17 on the go is technology at its higher point. Thats why computers are so convienient. So now you have read how helpful, how its a neccessity, and the computer is convienient. Now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the @CAPS15.	4	4	8
1352	1	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years, the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising, and enjoying nature. Is this good or bad? Technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park. Computers do have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage exercise, advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature, and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world. Firstly, computers are full of great advertisements. Some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising. Studys show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, whereas only @PERCENT1 of kids with computers do not get enough exercise. These statistics show that computers are better for people's health than they are thought to be. Next, computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world. By doing this, people's intellegence will increase because they will learn new facts about new places. Also, people will be happier because they enjoy travel. Lastly, people's jobs will benefit it they're business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet. Finally, the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer. Social sites such as facebook alow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled. Webcams allow people to talk face to face up close about the new gym they joined. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people say they have a better social life online then out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise, encourage travel, and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world. Technology is there to make the world a happier , healthier, and more social place. That is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world.	4	4	8
1361	1	"In modern society, @CAPS3 is rare that you come across someone who doesn't know how to basicly operate a computer. According to the statistics project known on youtube as ""shift happens"", most children in the @LOCATION1, @PERCENT1 in facts, have used a computer by age four. While @CAPS3 can be debated that computers are bad, i firmly disagree. Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. they have helped education, reconnecting, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and i hope that after reading this, you will too. At my schoo, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. Wheni look at these amounts and addit to what i know about computers in other @CAPS1 schools, @CAPS3 is clear to me that computers have helped the education system. Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button. There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. Also, teachers can put their grade books in their had drive. This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade. As a student, i think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways, but mostly in those above. At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. There are social networks such as facebook, twitter, and @CAPS2, that are valuable for finding your friend from @DATE1 camp. Let's say you have been connected with someone, and you've just found out that you got a promotion. You want to call, but you don't know the hone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at @CAPS3, ask for a phone number!) @CAPS3's always great to talk with old friends. Computers have helped @LOCATION1 make that easier. My friend recently purchased a sony laptop. She liked not only the features, but that @CAPS3 was an energystar, or eco-friendly. Now a days, computers have been made green in the battle for the environment. Paper is saved with online encylopedias, newspapers, journals, etc. Not only that but computers are needing less and less electricity. You save green and are green! Today's society is helping mother nature not only in our actions, but in computers too. In my opinion, computers are helping @LOCATION1, not hurting @LOCATION1. They have assisted education, social reconnecting and the environment. We must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer."	5	5	10
1366	1	Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs @NUM1 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer @NUM2 its bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go me go on the computer, but she @CAPS1 makes me go outside and run around @CAPS1 people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger chilld the wrong ideas. For example I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad peole post videos and the little children could see then and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time and with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad.	4	4	8
1375	1	"New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers is a benefit to society. Most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them. No matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eys off the screen. Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isnt' all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicans put together. If you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plety of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing whats going on. Do you like to stay organizes I personally, think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people need the computer to do their job and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working humans is a larger amount. So, thing about it, if computers weren't made, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would not have, jobs, or they would have to keep everything down on paper which @MONTH1 be a catastrophe. After a while, you @MONTH1 want to back everything up by copying all of your photos, files, music ect. to a @CAPS4 so you dont loose everything if your computer shuts down. After reading this, don't you agree with me, that computers are a benefit to society? There are many more reasons but this paper had alot. I hope you have realized that without computers, the world wouldn't be as it is today. Thank you for your time. "	5	5	10
1377	1	Wouldn't you like to find a @NUM1-star hotel or resteraunt with a click of a button? I know I would like to. So should we keep using computers for the good of our society, or not use computers to exercise more? Computers are helpful to us by doing work that has to be done neatly. It also helps by accessing and surfing the internet to more useful stuff. A computer is very intelligent and not only can came in a boring, heavy, boxed shape. Computers are also in some electronics. If you go on vacation and forget to turn off the lights, you can use your hand held computer to turn it off. Communication is pretty easy on a computer. All you need is computer (of course), a microphone or headset, some speakers, and a special software. After you have all of these, you can connect with the rest of the world! Talk to loved ones or family members through your computer. If you want, you can also get a web cam. A video camera used on your computer. Then you can see others face to face! If you do not have anything what I just said, there is also texting. Just use your computer keyboard to type and send a message. Your computer can also a lot more things. You can play mindless video games! Your computer must have the right specifications to play it. Sure it might be pricey to	4	4	8

The computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know. It also lets you communicate with your family, friends, or other people you need to communicate with. It can also let you see disasters in other countries and teach you about the world. Computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways. Computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know. If you're in school and you need to @CAPS1 research, well there you go, you have a computer to help you.

Another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them. If you have family or friends that live far away or in another country, then you can communicate them by computers. You can easily webcam with them or e-mail. This is very easy and this way you can stay close to them. This is also good if you @CAPS1 business online. You can @CAPS1 your job and talk to the people you need to talk to. If you ever have to arrange on emergency meeting and don't have time to call the people you need to, then simply send them an e-mail and your set for the meeting the next day and so are they. This is a perfect way for communication and business. My final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and you really wanted to see them, then you can go on your computer and see the news and learn new things and see what bad things have happened. Also if you live some where that isn't your home town, then you can go online and see what is going on at your hometown and visit for any special occassions.

Computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries. If you have a computer, then that is great. If you don't then you better go out and get one because these computers are awesome and can @CAPS1 just about anything you need. Stop waiting and get online or go out and buy one.	5	4	9
1393	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society."	5	6	11

Its now or never to decied @CAPS1 you want to waste your life over a computer. @CAPS1 you use your computer to much you can be at risk of becoming obese. You can become obese for @NUM2 reasons. You aren't exercising while you are sitting. Since you are sitting not doing anything else you start to eat a lot of snacks. finally @NUM2, is that you can lose the ability to walk as well because you aren't doing anything with your legs and the obesety makes it hard to walk anymore. The time has come to decide.

1410	1	Dear @PERSON1, The use of computers is not beneficial to our society. I fear that many kids will suffer from child hood obeasity, this is because of the inactiveness of so many teenagers my age. They @CAPS1 could be enjoying life outdoors and staying active, but they choose to sit infront of a screen all day, everyday. Researchers have proven inactiveness is at large due to many, facebook, mysape and twitter users. These websites are nothing but trouble, other than being unhealthy, teenagers all over are being cyber bullied, to the verge of suicide. Many are not aware of the several pedifiles and creepos these sights carry, which can lead to abduction, rape or worse. By staying active and being outdoors with your friends could save you from these dangers. Go outside run a little, you would be amazed how much a little exercise can help you. Also I firmly believe time should be spent with your family, doing family activities and eating dinner with your parents. By doing this you become closer as a family, and it could help you make healthier choices keep exercise. I believe by following these simple steps, staying active, staying off the computer and spending time with the family. Is much more beneficial than learning how to type, or talking to your friends. Using the computer leads to cyber bulling, and dangerous people, living healthy is the way to be.	4	3	7
1427	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone."	6	5	11
1436	1	"Dear @CAPS1, you sit down at the computer with a glass water and an afterschool snack, possibly an after work snack. You log on to your many accounts, open some chat boxes with your friends & start researching for your project. As more & more people log on to technology, they seem to come out with new things for computers. Some people are missing out, & dont see the negatives, like social relationships failing, procrastinatting, lack of learning & more! Beep! one new @CAPS2 message. On the computer you can talk to your friends & family, but sometimes people are on so much that in real life relationships fail. You cant type a @ORGANIZATION1 message or hide your feelings behind a screen. Also for kids when they get older, many jobs require customer service, and if you only are good at talking to people on the computer, it cant help you. Whatever you say on the internet can be read & posted anywhere, any site, any time, whereas in real life its really you talking. School are learning are very important too, but sometimes I know I have homework but procrastinate and say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 do it later, i need to check this out!"" putting my learning to a stop. Some people dont like school, but its very important in a persons life if you like to be successful, you need to balance school, learning, computer time, and dont forget exercise & possibly work! Computers can be helpful with research & guides, but facebook or twitter is going to slow you down. So buckle down start that research! Chatrooms, @ORGANIZATION2, email and other things can be harmful to you. There are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on. Its very dangerous, and someone can pretend to be someone there not. Also, computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome. There are many bad things that result from computers. Many times in your life youll need to find a balance. Dont overlook the negative or you could get hurt. Computers are nice to have, but be careful not to whittle away all of your time on it!"	4	4	8
1440	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. First, computers are a great source to do school work on. Computers let you learn more information. In addition, computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society. My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with. An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assainnment to do that had to be typed. Its impossible to type an essay without a computer. Further more, if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and their is no time in your day to go to a library, the computer is a great source. Now doesn't that make sense? Computers don't just help you with homework, but many people go to college online also. My parents don't have enough money to afford me to go to college, ""says @NUM1-year old @PERSON1,"" so I take free course online and they work great! ""@CAPS1 it obvious that computers have a good effect on people? In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great place to look when you need information. For example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area. The computer is an great place to look at updated pictures, and learn about your new hometown. Sixty-nine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home. People @MONTH1 also want to learn basic information about bears or bees is my belief that the computer is a great source to do learn infromation obviously, computers have a great effect on people and it benefit society. Lastly, computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends. ""I have my whole mom's side of the family living in @LOCATION1. When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them. I feel closer and part to keep in touch with them. i feel closer and part of one big happy family,"" @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2, says. People who have family living in other states, countries and even other countries, don't get to see eachother every day of the year @CAPS2 is why computers can help, the people keep in touch. Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days, weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them of ten. A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging. Therefore, i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society. to sum it all up, computers benefits society and have possitive effects on people. Computers are great sources to do school work, they give you information your looking for, and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends. Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and possitive effect on people and benefit the society. Thank you!"	5	5	10
1443	1	Computers have been one of technoligy's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfall. Originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places, computers have been proven to do quick the contrary. Computers are dangerous devices, and are targeting young, wholesome kids. It is the main reason why society is today, predicting that this future generation is wobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation. These devices, the source of this mayhem, must immediately be removes from society because they take away the true benefits of life, have harmful effects on our health, and support some of the country's deadliest predators. Firstly, computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood. Since @DATE1, the amount of adolescent users has shot up @PERCENT1. Amazing ly enough, @PERCENT2 of parents polled admitted that their children spend at least @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. This takes away the pleasures or reading, exercising, spending time outside and hnging with friends and fmaily. These negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society, especially teenagers, the most frequent users. As a result diet and exercise are curtailed, raising the obesity number by @PERCENT3, and lock of ourdoor or family activities have promoted anti-social @CAPS1 this alarming rate out fufture generation @MONTH1 indeed be balancing on a cracked foundation. In addition to limiting diet and exercise, computers are also the source of yet another act. As long as the computers are plugged, they emit invisible wares of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are linked to diseases and cancers. Use of computers have to cause brain-tumors and leukemia, asw ell as brain disorder and cancers. Leukemia, when caused at a young age, is difficult to cuse and stants the child's development. Children exposed to at least @NUM2 hours a day to @ORGANIZATION1 compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are @NUM3 times as likely to develop such possibilities. The ultimate prevention to such risjs is to to the rest of such causes, computers and it completely. Lastly, computers are harmful because they also a deadly we open. As an adolescent unthinkingly says the web and chtrooms, they are at risk of atteck by thousands of children predators prowling the web. Computers contain extremely valuable and secret information, such as names, birthdates, genders and even social security numbers. With one click, acfepting a strongers inivte, the online predators hack into the child's computer and obation such valuable information. Or the predators @MONTH1 be less postive and attack directly-asking questions to the child themselves. In fact, a familiar story tells the unfortunate fare of one local @CAPS2 girl, who unknowingly chatted with an online stranger. This online predator smoothly invited her to the mall, where they moved. A couple devastating, weeks later, the girl's reamin in were found, burned, as the last deadly act the predator performed on the teen. Three for, computers are simply too dangerous, a predator's thumbbook as they search for their next victim. by removing the computer, you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well. It is amazing to learn that technology's greates advanvcement, the computer, can unleash such harmful effects. Lack of engaging activities such as exercising and reading are stunded by the ever distracting computer its electromagnetic radiation attacks our health and lastly, it supports the acts of the thousands of cruel, sneaky online predators awaiting your child on the web. By removing the source of all these troubles, those acts can be prevented and society @MONTH1 begin to the pain for reform.	6	6	12
1444	1	"A large amount of people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees this technology benefits society. I think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways. This very useful technology has a positive effect on people because, it allows people to send, receive, and research a vast variety of information easily. @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to get information and get it more quickly than reading a book about that specific topic. They say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker. My cousin and I were both given the same research paper to do. He used several books to get information on the topic and I used the computer. The project took me @NUM1 days to do, while it took him a whole week to complete. @PERSON1, computer programming expert, said, ""Computers have made receiving information so much faster. I vehemently believe that everyone should own this device. Moreover, computers help with communication. There are many ways to keep in touch with people over the world, like email, chat rooms, and websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These websites are a great tool to keep in touch with family and friends or even fans. @PERSON2, lead singer of the band @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, said ""@CAPS1 is a way to talk to the fans directly ad post updates about upcoming tours and albums. Not only isit great for bands but it is great for college students. My older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away. The computer can also help with business. Meeting can be done through @ORGANIZATION2 or a different webchat service. Emails are a great way to send information. @NUM2 of business meetings are held over the internet has benefited work ethics. Please heed my advice and use the internet and computer. It will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information."	5	5	10
1446	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect. 	5	5	10
1447	1	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, computers are a wonderful tool and they bear many positive impacts on society first, computers have created numerous @CAPS2 forms of communication. Also, they have enable us to create a @CAPS2 age in research. In addition, computers have given us amazing @CAPS2 ways to entertain ourselves computers have a incredibly positive effetct on people. One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans, is that we have developed many @CAPS2 ways to communicate with people all over the world. First, one fantastic program such as @CAPS5 (instant messaging) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people any where in the world, and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face to face talking, second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we don't live in the same town, and I'm sure a similar experience has occured to you or someone you know. Finally, the popular program of facebook has changed communication forever. People can now see things go on in your info whereever want. Although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research. One example would be our phenomenon search engine, google. Google to almost everything with help people in finding schools now use computer resources such us @CAPS6 which allow in research to the fact that there is so much availbale on the. In addition, computers have created many opportunities for people to learn more because of the billions of web you in existance studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people have found a website conataining information relevant to their research that was than a book. Computer are the reason that research has contuined to thrive and @CAPS2 continue to be made. Finally, computers have established amazing @CAPS2 entertainment for people of all ages. First, video websited such as youtube have created a place for people to watch music videos and creative films just to enjoy themselves. If you can't get tickets to a concert you want going online to watch music videos by that person is a much cleaper alternative, second, jaming websites are a less expensive, but if you go online you can play similar games at no charge. Finally websites with appropriate funny stories posted on them are a fantastic way to get the laughter of a comic, without leaving your couch wouldn't you prefer to stay home, rather than going out when it isn't necessary? computers are an incredible way to achieve quick, un expensive entertaiment in todays economy. In conclusion, computers impact proper in many positive ways. they're established now forms of communication, research and entertainment that will forever change society. Therefore, I invite you to join me to demonstrate the icrredible strenght of computers.	6	6	12
1449	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefits the society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and it teaches people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world throughout everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the @LOCATION1 has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school I know that from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study in a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer know that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That's because with all the and websites it will teach us hand-eye coordination with I'm just having fun. Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy to use it. That's ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, than nothing does. As I have shown, computers deffinitly do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because it gives people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand-eye coordination. In conclusion, computers have a strong effect on people today.	4	5	9
1463	1	Dear Newspaper: I have just read your recsent article on a weather computers are helping, or recking society. I think it is helping because without the internet I can't learn how to do things such as clear a the proper way. This takes time to learn but out over internet I learned it quickly. If you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you. There are many other uses is you just can't find your family is counting on you. You can do two things, you can panic and let everyone down, you can go or the internet and save. But all I have wasn't to the real. The computer does effect how people exercise I know what you are. but you have. Clear enough. The internet does effect how you exercise. It's pros how to better and more affective ways to healthy. There is also cons; some of the con sinclude hot. All of these can lead to different things like going or. it isn't, its only a bad thing when your. In conclusion just do the right things and you will be healthier than ever.	4	4	8
1467	1	"Almost everyone in the @LOCATION1 uses a computers at one point in their life. Computers are a way to teach hand eye coordination through programs, games and typing. The internet can be used for researching different far away cultures, as well as someone's own lifestyle. This compact well made piece of technology has been belaming more and more intricate. Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will be the down fall or support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand-eye coordination. Since the time children are in grade school, they learn typing on a keyboard. Special programs help kids learn the necesary skill while enjoying the practice. When I was small, a mere fight years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to barnes and noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed ""type to learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons as well as teaching children to type is general, teaches hand-eye coordination in high school, college, and the job world. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resemes, and applications. In this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand-eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, bejewled or car racing teach the skill and much more advanced games for example, world of war craft need perfect coordination can be through typing and games, both on the computer. Though some experts are conserned ""people are spending too much time on the computer and less time..enjoying nature,"" you are able to learn about geography, travel, and nature. One amazing on a computer is the world wide web. This consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and information arte you in an upcoming geography uses? Are you planning a trip the for you do you need to find a definition for the word ""cognitive""? of @CAPS1 pertain to you, a legitamite website house your and all you need to do is search. Instead of having to travel to learn about special wonders, for travel prices are expensive and you can simply, click and type to and amazing at your searching on a computer, you can learn about long ago cultures and rituals. Information you would find at museum @NUM1 years ago. @CAPS1 complex simple to use technological a world of pictures simple, art and history right at your fingertips."	5	5	10
1478	1	"Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathmatics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other contantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors. Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. They make it easier to see their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Lets say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away. You would halfway have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home. There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the raln forest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever changing sands of the sahara desert. You could learn about the greeks, archemedes, ancien egypt, or pacman, with a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together. So think, are computers really harmful?"	5	4	9
1482	1	More people tend to use computer's more than going outside enjoying the weather, and I think people should less time on the computer and more time interacting with whom ever. People spend most of their time talking to people on any websites/playing online games. I think that it's a bad habit, people of all ages spend their time doing that when they can do something fun, but chose not to. Parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous. There has been many people who have been hired. Raped in websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many other dangerous websites. In be more I would say that children and adults talk to strangers and think they know that personso well, meet them some place and get killed or anything because many people lie they age. And who know that person can be a fiftey year old woman or man. Say their a teen and end up finding you That is why parents should not be let their children be on period of time and should be on. While you reading this I hope you understand why it's rong and take my suggestion under and help us young kids to (thank you)	4	3	7
1486	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I understand that more and more people use computers, and that can have a good side and a bad one. Do you go on the computer for hours every day? That could be bad. I believe computers are good thing, but only if they are used properly. Hopefully when I'm done, you'll see where I'm coming from on this matters. Everyone is on the computer these days. The problem is, many people are on way too much. They say they are working on hand-eye coordination, but in reality they are wasting away their lives on a chair. They do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big, happy family. They say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and viruses. Bad people are out there, and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day. Things like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you. Yes, being on the computer definitely has a bad side. But there is a good side as well. That is, as long as you are not on too much. It does improve hand-eye coordination, if you play the right games. And it can teach you things, too. Many websites have true information about place or things so you don't need to see it to know about it. You can be helpful. It is also an easy way to purchase items. You can just order them. Most importantly, you can have fun. So, what is your side on this argument? Do you think way too many people are on the computer. Or do you think computers can be great, as long as you're careful? I, for one, pick the latter one. What about you?	4	4	8
1492	1	Dear local news paper, I think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age. Starting at thirteen and up through adulthood. People spend hours at a time on the computer when they canbe exercising or doing some type of activity out doors. Computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away form them. Spending so much time on a computer can really damage a person posture. It is said that when some get on a computer a state of comfortbility comes over them and they lean over with their backs bent and they there for periods of time. Imagin a person being cramped in a tight space for eight hours and when that person gets out they all their joints and muscles being stretched from that point of tensions. This is what we do to our bodys when we get on computers.	4	4	8
1495	1	Dear @CAPS1, I agree with the experts that people spend to much time on the computer, people should be exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. But people are so lazy and would rather be sitting and doing something on the computer and if they dont start doing other things instead of being online they could become overweight. My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercize. Seriously people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy. My second reason why I think people should spend less time online is because you should be spending time with your friends and family not ignoring them because your doing something on the computer. Thats just rude, so why dont you go and have a family game night or go out to eat with your family and you could also watch a movie, go skating, or even go to the park with your friends because thats a lot more fun than being online all day. My last reason why people should spend less time online is because everyone should have time to just read a good book honestly just walk down to your local library and check out a book because reading is way better for your brain than doing stupid stuff on the computer. So in conclusion, in my opinion I think people should spend less time online is because if you dont get enough exercize you can become over weight and lazy, and not spending a lot of time with your friends and family is just rude and reading is very good for you unlike staying on the computer, well that is all I have to say for now.	4	4	8
1502	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe that with too much use of computer it will have bad affects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also use a lot of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad affects computers have, but their not all bad, without them life might be a little harder. Playing computer games, and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them everyday. Online poker could be dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in debt. Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop. It's a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addicting too. There's a website that called addicting. I guess people don't know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 goes to computer? Thats almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic chrisis I don't think enery should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people any need. If everyone didn't need computers to communicate and everything there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. I understand emailing, and facebook. But don't get out of hand with it. Isnt being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or excercise rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not excercising. I remember when I was younger, everytime I went to my friends house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most @CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I would define they rather excersise or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer it can have bad affects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family?	6	4	10
1512	1	Dear Local @CAPS1, I have been infromed that people don't get to talk to friends/family, enjoy nature and exercise because of computers. Well computers benefit our life. The first thing about/ computers is communication. People can use @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and etc. The social networking groups are for abilities to talk to friends, long distance or close and family enjoy research. Just because @CAPS11 use those internet websites doesn't mean @CAPS11 can't go outside and enjoy activities. This leads to other objects called peortables. As technology advances so does our skills. Every year more electronics are made and most likely are portable such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6 phones, @CAPS7, and etc. Many of these companies let us take these devices to allow as to do everyday things. With @ORGANIZATION1 creater of the @CAPS8 @CAPS11 can use this internet/music @CAPS9 for everything. for example, I visit my grandparents and I decied to my @CAPS6 phone. I can talk to friends on my @CAPS6 phone by texting and visit my grandparents. More of this opplies to and @CAPS5 @CAPS11 still all go outside and enjoy life. exercise is something @CAPS11 should yet to. If you stay cramed in your house @CAPS12 fun. @CAPS11 need to cheer up and go outside and play sports. @CAPS11 could get included in and join activity. @CAPS11 also can have videos online to show us how to exercise or use yoga. Most of use portables which goes back to my last paragraph. Exercise is big and @CAPS11 all should do it. What I'm trying to say here @CAPS11 can use computers and electronics and exercise with fun one in all. If you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate.	4	4	8
1515	1	"Dear newspaper editor: @CAPS1 are all living in the age of technology. There are many useful devices that help us live our every day lives. The computer is a major help. @CAPS1 can talk with relitives from different areas and you can surf the internet to learn new information. @CAPS4 you can playing games with people from ground the world. The computer is a great divice. Almost everyone has a relitive that lives in another state or country. Well you never see them because they live far away right? With a computrer you can talk and even have a face to face conversation with them. @CAPS2 can bring your family closer together. For example, my family just got a new computer and @CAPS1 have relitives that live in florida that @CAPS1 almost never see. With the computer my dad talks to them almost everyday. Some people that I have talked to said that ther are excited to see their relitives or friends more often. @CAPS2 has brought them closer together and made them better friends. The internet is a wonder place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics. When kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 saves time. @PERCENT1 of kids said that when they are doing a project the best thing to use would be the internet. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 helps the kids work faster so they can spend more time outside or hanging out with their friends. Another thing you can do is learn about recent events. For example most local newspaper have a website that you can visit. Even if you local does not you can go to other websites like ""@CAPS3"". They have recent events that happen around the country and around the world. The internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life. Every kid gets bored when its a rainy day. So they can play games with people from around the world using a computer. The are many websites that have fun games that are fun and enjoyabal. You can @CAPS4 become with people from other contrys. My friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 play the computer and they have alot of friends from other contrys. I think that its cool that you are playing the exact game with another. Person in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, @CAPS4 most of the games are safe and fun to play. Another thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your home town. I have many times playes games with @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @CAPS2's a fun thing to do during a boring, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful divice thats benefits us and helps us with our everyday life. @CAPS2 allows us to connect with family in far away places and surf the internet for new information. @CAPS4 you can play games with people from around the world. Its a wonderful divice and lets start using @CAPS2. "	5	5	10
1523	1	@CAPS1 you know we all like computers and we all use it for all different tyoes off things like to chat or to do work and most importantly to fine something but computers are in a way not that good for you especially if your computer is your life, one reason I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are on it for when you are on it for along time you get hungry then you get some snaks and by the time your done using the computer gained. A pound no imagin how much wiget you will gain if you do that every day alot! My next reason why I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are the computer too long your eyes start to hurt and your hands start to cramp and everything starts to hurt to much typing and looking at the same thing for along to can make you have eye problems and can also give you something in your hands and then you will not to be able to do anything with your hands for along time because it will start hurting. My last reason why i think computers in a way are bad because it can mess your computers up it can over heat or just down because you have ben on it for too long. It can also get a virese then you will just have to get a whole new computer @CAPS1 you can see there are plenty of reasons why I think computers are kinda bad	4	4	8
1531	1	"Who in the world would say a computer is useless. No one, computer are one of the most useful device ever made. I think that computers are perfect and can help you build skills. I have @NUM1 reason it build skills, fast information and fun. Now lets get started with skill. Skills are things you need to have if you want to pursue a career. You can learn skill from book, tv and computers. For example i learned how to type rapidly on a keyboard from a computer on a game called type to learn. After a week of this game. I was typing like a pro. The computer also has chess to help build stragety. Just ask my super smart english teacher @PERSON1 ""she say that chess build's character and strength your mind. Moving along, i want to talk about how you can get information in a instant with computers. Experts say that it the number one way to get iinfo badly. I know i argeed with that, after study for a test on @LOCATION1 carver in my book, but one of my pages was missing so. I used my computer not only did i get my information quickly. I had gotten more information than the book. The next day i passed my test. @NUM2 percent . You how useful a computer can do. Finally, i want to talk to you about good old faishon fun. As you know are perfect for building skill and get information, but you can away alway use a computer for fun. Do you know anyone in the world that can say the computer is not fun. No you can't because everyone in the world use the computer for fun stuff like online game, video and talk to people. Thanks for my reason about computer building skill, having info and fun."	4	4	8
1535	1	Here is my @CAPS1 I think computers are useful and here are my @NUM1 reasons one kids can talk to their friends @CAPS2 they are punsied. My second reasons is people can go on the computer @CAPS2 they are bored for ex: @CAPS2 a kid beat all teir games and @CAPS2 they are bored they go search for new ones to buy, my final reason is @CAPS2 people want to look up something for something 'like their project but @CAPS2 the labireey is closed they can just copy down the thing they need. My first reason is, kids can talk to their friends on the computer @CAPS2 they are grounded for ex: I was grounded in @DATE1 for slapping my cousion in face but I still got to talk my friends kthen we are still talking but the only way to trick your parterents are to tell you are aking your friend about homework. Myh second reasons is people can go on the computer @CAPS2 they are bored for ex: @CAPS2 a kid beat all his games and he is broded te can go serch for new ones to buy or rent them or play downloadable games for the computer. My final reason is @CAPS2 someone wants to look up something for his or her project and the liebreey is closed for information and copy it down for your project. My conclusion is we need computers to survive without them we will be in the stone age still.	3	3	6
1556	1	Dear @CAPS1, Computers play a huge role in society. Many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and I think that is bad. Instead of being on computers, I think it would be best to spend time with your family. Exercising and enjoying the outdoors is also a good time consuming activity to do. Studying, school work, and jobs are also important things people should be doing instead of being on the computer so much. Family is very important in life and some people take advantage of it. Instead of being on the computer all day, spending home with family and doing activities with them could be more fun. For example, most teenagers come home from school and go on this computer to talk to friends or play games instead of talking with this parents about this day or anything. By spending time with family you not only learn more about them but you can become closer and be able to talk with them about anything. Nature is a beautiful thing. Sure you can see pictures of nature on the internet, but! is is not the same as the actual thing. By outside, and enjoying nature, taking walks, runs, or even hikes, you can get your exercise. Exercising is a very important thing in a persons life, because you need to be fit to be healthy, and by being on a computer all the would happen. Adults, and even some teenagers have jobs in. While some jobs involve computers, most do not. No one can get in job by spending all day on the computer playing games. I talking to people. Teenagers well and do while playing game talking to. Computer are all the time. There are plenty of important activities, such as, spending time with family, enjoying nature, and school work and jobs. Computer are not necisity. We lives, so I think use should using them	4	4	8
1557	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 tired, lazy people sitting on their computer and wasting their life bacause of it. The issue to with is do you think that people are spending to much time on the computer or not. I strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer. And, here are @CAPS2 reasons why, people are spending less time exercising, people not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt you probably know that exercising is at least somewhat helpful to life, @CAPS4 if people are sitting home @NUM1 on the computer with no exercise, it is going to cause people to gain an excess amount of wait. Because the more they just sit around. And do nothing except the computer. The more they're going to be and the more lazy they're going to be. So they're not going to want to do anything and really it's just a waist of life. And, in some cases it can cause depression. Just ask a local resident who says "" @CAPS2 mom used to be on the computer all the time and did nothing with her life,"" and @CAPS3 she became depressed. And, soon after, killed herself."" @CAPS3 more and more people are going to become like. I know that a lot of people like to be outside when its a nice sunny day. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 somebody on that day in a room, with their eyes to the computer screen. Because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 if that was someone you loved. Doing that with their life. I'm pretty sure you would try to do something to help them get off that path. Just ask another local resident @PERSON1 who says, ""I remember coming home everyday, and there was @CAPS2 mom, no shades up, pitch block, it was like a dark cave, and she would sit there for hours on the computer wasting her life, and I remember asking her how long has it been since you've gone outside, she answered, its been almost two months."" @CAPS4 I know from @CAPS2 family that there was a family member of mine who was a ""computer junkie"" And, I remember at a family get together @CAPS2 aunt was the only one who could never come. Because she was to busy on the computer. And, she"	4	4	8
1558	1	@PERCENT1 of all people in the @LOCATION3 have computers. This number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer. It help us communicate better get imformation quicker and entertain us. Computer have a very positive effect on us. With the invention of the computer, more and more people can communicate quicker and eaisier. For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, @CAPS1 you have relatives who live across the country, you could use webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world. You can learn alot more about other countries culture and other cities way of life. Finally, @CAPS1 a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, the relationship just gets better. The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet you can findout how tall a maple tree is or , how to lose weight. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities nature walks and new and exciting excersises. When students need information on a school project, they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it. When the computer came, people could plaly games, watch @CAPS2.V. and movies, and do business. @CAPS1 you missed you favorite @CAPS2.V. Show you can go online and watch them. @CAPS1 you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, e-mail comes into place, and you mail will never be slow. And finally, you can play many, many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination. With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. Theres information quicker, communication better, and entertainment better. All of the search were in a very good world.	4	4	8
1562	1	The importance of computers in the modern world. Computers now and days are popular thecnology now and days computer are a bigger calculator. The invension of the computers were a very short cauculator. It's like a mother begin in your house. Lot of people have different of computers are more improve more faster and more high quality. The computer are now and days are improving their technology, every day there a billions buying computer across the whole world but that does not mean that there the best quality but the people are fighting for better modern inversions.	2	2	4
1575	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people. Since I have two computers and one laptop I have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer. Everyone should have computers, because you can look up different things, you can play games like checkers with the computer or against somebody else, and the last reason @CAPS1 that you can chat with people from different states and even countries, because I know everybody likes to talk to one another. Everyone should have computers, because you can search different things. You can search places and people. Basically, you can search anything on the internet @CAPS3 you are on the right website. One time I wanted to go on the web and look to see @CAPS3 there was a in @LOCATION1. I went to ask.com and typed in ""@CAPS1 there a in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1? It said yes, and then it showed me a @CAPS2 of information about. It told me the address the phone number and the name of the manager. Looking up places in sometimes. Everyone should have a because you can play any types of game. You could play internet game checkers, solitaire and even freecall. @CAPS3 you don't any types of games you can always go on gaming just games up there. Since I use the computer everyday onto all. When I was six years old we a driving game. Since I did not the website all I got to play was checkers on the computers but one day logged onto it and played my first driving computer game. Everyone should have a computer, because you can chat with people. Instead of always using your phone calling and texting people raising your phone bill, why not use your computer and chat all you want without wasting minutes on your cell phone. I know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone. Instead of doing that just go on the internet find a chatcom and start chatting or bloging with your friends. One time I ran out of minutes on my phone and I didn't have internet. I asked my dad @CAPS3 I could use the computer. He said yeah, so I went to a local chatroom on the internet. My friend had an acount there so it would be easy for us to talk all we wanted. I joined in and we chatted until @TIME1. In conclusion I think everyone that likes to look up places, play games, and chat should have a computer."	4	5	9
1584	1	Alot of people have different ideas on if they believe computers benefit society. I for one believe that computer are useful for many things. The first reason why I believe this, is because one a lot of schools will need them for students, to do projects. Second they have computer gamed to help kids learn. Third I believe its a good way to just relax. The first reason why believe computers are good is because many kids in school will need them. In school we have a lot of projects that we might need type or get a picture. If we didn't have computers there would be no way we could do that. Also if we do persuassive waiting pieces. We would need a computer to type it to make it looks better. Many people might say we could all just write it out. But I believe that typing it might be faster and neater for some people. The second reason why I believe computers are good is because they have many good games to help people I know that have many different games text not readable Computers are good is because it's a a good way to relax. Aint of people get home from work or and are very tired. But instead of just going and sitting on the couch for the whole night you could go to the computer and do a fun game for a little while. Many people say that watching tv and going on the computer is the same things. But if you play an educational game once in a while it might be ok. But then you can do something fun on the computer every so often. In conclusion I believe computers are good because one many kids need them for school second they have a lot of educational games. its a good way to relax.	5	4	9
1586	1	"Dear, Newspaper People should use less time on the computer because it effects their lifestyle. Instead of using their computer all the time they shoul exercise hang out with their friends and family and just enjoy nature. First of all computer's can bring a lot of obesity to the @LOCATION1 because it bring lazyness and it makes peole not went to exercise. If people start to exercise at least around @PERCENT1 of lazyness will go down. They should at least go out for a walk instead of using all their electrity. Also around @PERCENT2 of your electrity bill will go down if you go exercise instead of using computer. Secondly people need to start enjoying nature insteed of being on the computer at the time. People should go green and start recyling and not worrying about what somebody said on ""myspace"" or ""facebook"". Also if we started recyling and worring about nature @PERCENT3 of the earth would be greener. My last reson being their should be more friendler family time enstead of computer time. Computers just make you break away from your family and friends because your worrying whats happening on the internet. @PERCENT4 of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends. In my conclusion these are my reasons being for people so they wont use the computer so much and so they can just kick back chill with your friend and family, exercise and enjoy natur"	4	3	7

Computers help us communicate, research different topics, and have just plain fun things to do. Computers make it easy to communicate. Things like ""@CAPS2"" and ""facebook"" let us talk with each other. Some @MONTH1 contest ""@CAPS3, use a phone or go out."" @CAPS1 if they're away on a trip, or live thousands of miles away? With computers everything is easier. Computers allow us to reserch topics @CAPS5 need for classes or work. ""@CAPS5 can get alot of detailed information from thousands of sites. Sceptics might ask the question ""@CAPS6 not go to a library."" Some of us might prefer to stay at home. Another reason is, that it maybe snowy, or the library is closed. @CAPS1 ever the reason, computers make reserch fast and easy. Computers also fulfill a great need to entertain ourselfs. Games sites like ""facebook"" have become very popular. They can provide us with emotional release from the everyday world. A pontential argument might you ""@CAPS6 go outside?"" The weather could for bad and your sick. Computers are fun, education and a communication wonder. should find the good in computers and @CAPS1 they could do for there."	4	4	8
1628	1	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you.	5	5	10
1637	1	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a benefit to our society. These computers are an advantage to our learning and knowledge. By using computers students can get there work done quicker and more efisent. While typing your report on the computer you might spell a word wrong well every computers has spell check. Also you @ORGANIZATION1 need to look up a word because you don't know the deffinition all you have to do si go to @LOCATION1 and type in the word and automatically you have the deffinition. You @ORGANIZATION1 have been given a book report so you can go online and copy and paste @CAPS2 do @CAPS2 no @CAPS2 want let you but @CAPS2 you had a piece of paper and your pen you could write @CAPS2 down. A computer has made the life of a school student so much easier. You @ORGANIZATION1 need a job but cant stand, walk, talk well you could get a job working on a computer. Computers allowed more jobs to be made and replaced. Without a computer how would teachers get mail sent to them without wasting paper. Sure a computer uses electrisity but paper wastes trees. Anyway you think about @CAPS2 the computer is a good thing to invest in. Going to college not everyone has enough time in a day to drive to school, well with your computer you can go to school right online. So if you don't have money to by a back pack you don't need one your mates stay right where you left them. So a computer is a good invention. @CAPS2 has made life quicker, eco friendly and even has saved trees. On the brightside @CAPS2 has even produced many jobs. Last minute things can even be online. Each computer bought has given someone else a new expense.	4	4	8

1645	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @DATE1, computers are a big part of our society. They are an advance in technology, and they have some positive effects. However, computers have more negative effects on people. They take away and diminish @CAPS3 time, interacting with family, and seeing the world. First, computers have a negative effect on people because they diminish @CAPS3 time. People are so caught up with computers, their desire for @CAPS3 starts to fall. According to a @ORGANIZATION3 survey in @DATE2, for @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer a week (roughly @NUM2 hours each day) had an increase in cholesterol and slowly deterioating muscles. ""Computers distract people from their needs"" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people get this amount."" The leading cause for this low number? ""technology,"" she says, ""@CAPS2 computers, which take away all of the motivation and time people need to @CAPS3."" @CAPS3 is vital, and computers are taking this away from society. People shouldn't have bad @ORGANIZATION1 because of this negative effect: computers. Second, computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family. @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people say that computers take away from their family time, reports Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. This is not of all good, especially since @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to eat up time, it also cuts of communication, something extremeley important in graving children. with this, family bonds and relationship are ruined as wal. It affects interacting with family, and puts hates in family bonds: computers haved negative effect on people. Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world. When you're on the computer, it seems like the entire world is in your computer screen. But its not. This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notedly become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net. The cure? Traveling, or even talking walks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of their world in which they live. They have to make important descions for themselves, their children, even their country, and staring at a computer screen wont help at all. It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, it takes away from people seeing the world, something actually very important because it affects people's desicion making as well as future generations. People need to realize these bad effects, and majorly decrease their computer usage."	6	5	11
1647	1	Dear newspaper, Technology is a very useful thing But is also a bad thing, it makes people lazy on . A computer is a multi-use tool. Along with this people cango on any website . Anything, as in research or personal reasons. First off, let me point out that computers are useful multi-purpose tools. Computers can also, @CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people. A lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end. Students sometimes go home and strayht oor tug computer instead of doing homework. Moreover, computers can help you pay bills. Do research, or maybe just for fun play games. There is an ulimeted number of websites & to cp on through to hep you with many of needs. Uploading family pictures from your last vacation? its simple with most computer soft . Finally, computers is kind of like one . They can even become a blank just waiting for a pinest of insparation.	3	3	6
1653	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer? Computers have a negative affect on people! You could be damaging your sight, time should be spent playing outside, and it'll make it harder to talk to people in person. Do your eyes tend to hurt when your finally off the computer? Whether or not you playing games or typing articles your eyes @MONTH1 strain to keep up with a small font on a website. I remember the time when I read an online novel and my whole body was ready to go and play. Except for my eyes. Instead of playing sports games on the computer you should get up and play one outside! When your on a computer, your most-likely indoors. Did you knew a person should be be outside for at least @NUM1 minutes to get there vitamin @CAPS3. Your net sustaining the right amount of vitamins you need daily, at a computer screen. Do you ever find it easier to talk to someone on the computer, than it is in person? Your not the only person that thinks that way. If you get off of the computer and talk to one face to face you can improve your social skills. At first it wont be easy but its worth it in the long run. By now you know that computers aren't really giving off a positive effect. There hurting your vision, limiting your outdoor activity time and making it harder to talk to people in person. So come on put down the mouse down and find something ""hands on"" to do!"	4	4	8
1663	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that people could use computers all the time and never get off. Well I don't. Think about all the negative things that could happen. Like spending less time with your family, getting addicted, and unhealthy. People who spend all there time on the computer forget that there family is there. For instance, I remember when I was little and I was on the computer and I forgot that i had family members with me, so I missed out on all the fun things like going to the mall or park. Certainly, playing on the computer is fun but woudn't you want to give some attention to your family. Almost @PERCENT1 of people in other countries be very lonely because all they @CAPS1 is play on the computer and forget about other people. You woudn't want to be like these other people right? I never thought playing on computers could be addicted. Lots of people in other countries can't last a day without playing on computers. Some say almost all the people that play on computers all day, day to night have died because they bairly eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. Imagine you life being ended because of addiction on computers. I remember when my friend told me, ""don't be on the computer to long you might die,"" and I thought it was a joke. So think about going on the computer all day and night. Not but not least, some people aren't treating their body properly. For example, some people playing on compters forget about eating, sleeping or walking around. This tends to make people's legs num and make people's stomach hurt alot. Imagine not eating, sleeping and walking around for a day. You woudn't even want to try this. Now is the time to decide, wheither people should be able to play on the computer day to night. Also all the negative things that can happen like spending less time with family members, getting addicted, and being unhealthy. So get right up and decide."	4	5	9
1684	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extreamly bad for you, and we need to take percaution, and worry about eye protection vertual harrasment, and that there are dangerouse people on the @CAPS2. Eye protection is important. Although computers are hurting them by, the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes. Also if you look for too long it could make them tierd. I can tell you from personal experence that glasses are un-cool and some people get picked on for it and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you can see as well as you did befor. It's glasses or even going blind. Vertual harrasment is another thing to be aware of. Over the @CAPS2 you could be cyber bullyed by kids you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not know. For example, one day you could be on @CAPS3 and be talking on a chat room and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or even just plain remakes. Witch brings me to the, sexual harrasment. Sexual harrasment if extreamly can make people feel usually bad selfs. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding there rase, there gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra percaution when seeing sexual harrasment. Sexual preditors are a parents biggest fear to kids. Sexual preditors are everyware, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS3, or even your neibors and wile kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do there extreamly un-safe. This is why you @CAPS7 put any personal information on the @CAPS2 not your adress, not your birthday, not your cell or house numbers, nothing not even your town. Also sometimes its a little dangerous to put your last name. So be very carful on the intrenet. When you see sexual harrasment, or someone being followed by a sexual preditor report them! and be safe.	4	4	8
1700	1	"What is technology? Technology is defined as anything that helps enhance our way of living. Technology is all around us. Our beds, houses, televisions and even chairs are all forms of technology. There is one form of technology however, in my opinion, has revolutionized modern day living as we know it. This form of technology is called the computer. My outlook on the effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive. Just think of all of the things we rely on this device to do. There is one thing, however that really sticks out in my mind; @CAPS1. The computer is perhaps the greatest form of @CAPS1 the world has ever seen. E-mail is basically sending a letter to a friend without the hassle of mailing it out where it might get lost or stolen. E-mailing is two simple steps: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Not only does it lower the risk of the letter not getting there, but it is also much quicker. You hit the ""sen"" button and before you know it, a new letter is sitting in you friends inbox. Another method of computerized @CAPS1 is my personal favorite, instant messaging. Instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away. And it's okay if you decide to go get a soda while you are instant messaing because unlike a real conversation, that isn't rude. These are just two methods of @CAPS1 that the computer enables us to have. Tehre is a variety of other that, much like these two, enhance our way of life. I believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing: the internet. The internet makes everything we do on the computer possible. If i want to gon on the computer and do research on a topic, the internet takes me where i want to go. With millions of different websites, the internet has endless possibilities. If I'm interested in arcade games, I can go on the internet and play them. If i have to write a science report, then i can go on the internet and collect research. If i want to listen to music, tehn i can go on the computer, look up a song, and listen to it. And guess what? If i'm looking for a funny video just for a good laugh, then the internet can find me one! The internet is perhaps one of the greatest things ever invented. It's just another reason to love the computer."	4	5	9
1709	1	Everyone loves staying on the computer. I would be surprised if one does not. I believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that is also as enjoyable on it is. People learn too much on it. It changes peoples whole life. The computer is like a disease or a virus that controles you and gaining your freedom from it perfectly possible. I understand that some people @MONTH1 not agree with me, however I propose that my side is the best. This is horrible. How can it? It distracts people from their life. I makes them blind to enjoy nature. Spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease. The hard part is to get in your freedom is being able to know that it is ocntroling you. That way your door to freedom will be open. The tecknologie keeps you away from having fun, doing homework from school and having fun with friends. I know that you can break free from it because I once experienced the same thing. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed. I has so many information in it you wont even think a person it. I know even more than . However it is also very foul. Once I came up on a very horrible seen on the computer. I my i can shut it . Michines have a mind that it our and anything it. Changing a persons life is not easy. You become complitely new. Sometimes those changes are good sometimes they are bad. But a michine can make you change in ten minutes. Once you see what you like on it or what you want you can change. If you see something and you want it so bad. I you cant get if then you will be forced to get it by stealing. It is a very horrible thing to learn. All you have to do is learn to controle your self. Machines are a very bad influence on people. There are book if you need information. Computers make you lazy you don't have to read or anything it does it for you. It take over your life. You become . It teaches you bad thing it changes your life. What path would you take	4	4	8
1723	1	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you think that computers have bad effect on people today? I know I don't. Over @PERCENT1 of people today have a computer. On a computer you can find great things about a place and people. If you don't have the best handwriting then you can type it and computer can help you look stuff up. @CAPS1 you want to go and look you your favorite hockey player? Instead of going to the library and hoping that theres a book on him. You can just @ORGANIZATION1 his name and hundreds of different websites using will came. That will save a lot of your day and it will save a lot of you money. If you go on a family trip each year to the sum. Place you need a change? Then you can look up another place online that @MONTH1 has the same features but it @MONTH1 be way closer then going to @LOCATION1 each year. So, if you have a computer then you can look places you @MONTH1 want to travel to or look up cool facts about your future sport player. If you have messy handwriting and its getting harder and harder for your teacher to read then you can just learn how to type it up on the computer. At least @PERCENT2 of students in schools today are getting zero on homewrok or test because their teacher can't read their hand writing. If you type it up on a s computer then you will spelling or grammar as you ever you for sizes and color as pictures are make your grade high to the fact you little more work into you die. So, to all the people who think that computer help anyone well reasons why computer can help someone. Computers can help kids find something or can help them computer can also find video about your favorite player or about you favorite hockey players give warning not the playoffs. You can find all good stuff online. You can find your favorite song for your cellphone. Over @PERCENT3 of people get the song from the computer. Also the computer can play the favorite song on the computer. For example if your favorite band was drop kick murpheys then you can @ORGANIZATION1 that are you will find all of their songs. Alot of people think that computer are not good for us. But, I say they are wrong. You can find info about there future person they can look up there. If you have messy handwriting then you can go and type it up lastly you can songs, video, and much more when you browse the web. For example, @LOCATION2, @MONTH1 be there very own website. Computer can help kids find info better we type your paper sloppy.	5	4	9
1726	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you know that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? Computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. Computers are taking away family time, exercise privledges, and time spent on school on school work. ""@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!"" @CAPS4 mom's will say this to childeren at least once as week, the answer that is @CAPS4 common is ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 childeren from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer weather it's playing games or talking with friends. This is on issue that needs attention. Families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother that is always playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with @PERSON1 play computer. Aport from spending time with family computers take away @CAPS6 kids exercise privlidges. One example is that last week it snowed and I wanted my neigbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me but, she said had to finish a level on a computer game and it was realy important. This proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise. A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to @CAPS4 people except for @CAPS4 teenagers would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actualy spending time with them. Lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen. When does homework got done? I took a survey recently among the eighth grade and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of the people that don't do their homework are due to spending too much time on the computer. In my science class a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. I asked him why one day and he says it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. @CAPS5 time spent with family, @CAPS5 exercise getting done, @CAPS5 time to play outside, and missing homework assignment are alot to sacrifice for ""@CAPS8 one more level."" I you want to help me get childeren not spend so much time on computer, write on artical on this important issue in one of your newspaper and please consider my ideas."	4	5	9
1753	1	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer? Too many is my geuss! They are warping the minds of people all over, and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, and say that computers help children who are in school. That @MONTH1 be true, but honestly only a couple decades ago the average student didnt even own a computer, and school were teaching the same materials without the usage of them. Also, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays, and I'm sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools. Another reason computers @MONTH1 not benefit society is because of the dangers of them. Sexual predators sworm the internet, and many people talk to strangers over the internet that @MONTH1 be harmful, without even realizing it. A third reason computers @MONTH1 not be help society @CAPS2 you can see, I feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society, for many reason. I hope you can agree with me 	4	4	8
1754	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like @CAPS2 you were to write rection on computers. They teach @LOCATION3 faraway places, help build hand-eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk online. Computers are part of everyday life and needs to be told about. First, computer let @LOCATION3 learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. One of my mom's friends, They decide to move to @LOCATION2 she didn't like computer so didn't look at @LOCATION2's laws saying, I'll find out when I got there. ""@CAPS2 did find out the laws she didn't find enough cause cause she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few monthes after her last arrest she came back to the @LOCATION3 where she could deal with the laws. @LOCATION2 is a buetifull country and all of arrests were accidents because she didn't know the laws. Ten minutes on computer searching the laws in @LOCATION2 could have kept her in @LOCATION1. Next, comptures improve hand-eye coordination. From a survey @PERCENT1 of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. @PERSON3, a gym teacher at the @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 of these kids that spend time on the compture are weak and need to get some exercise.Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT2 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS5, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS5, the people agree with what @PERSON2 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but @CAPS2 you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, @CAPS2 you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because @CAPS2 you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS5, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS5, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever @CAPS2 you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot! From so many students having greater hand-eye cooridination they will enjoy what their good at like tennis. @PERSON1, a professor of the human body at @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Technology helps hand-eye. Many who use computers more than others to be greater at @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and games along those lines."" This shows how hand-eye and exercise is linked to computer. Furthermore, computers help @LOCATION3 talk with other people. When a child goes to college they will still be able to email their famlies and talk to them. Talking with others by computers makes the world go round. World business need computers to contact eachother to decuss plans on how to move toward economicly. Lastly, computers are useful and should be useful more. They teach @LOCATION3 of faraway places, improve hand-eye coordnation, and let @LOCATION3 talk to other people. @CAPS2 an article is made to show the pros or computers, more people will experience the wonders of them."	5	5	10
1782	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers are a good source of technology. The reasons which I am fighting for tell why, kids are in school more than half of the school day. Parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. To begin, kids are in school more than have of a school day. How could children stay on the computer when there in school learning? They can't. In school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around. After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. Computers don't have effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away. Parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online. Lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. If you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. Also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too! Another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports. We need our information! To conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider because, mny other people would be shy to wirte this and get it published in their local newpaper! I would like to say computers are not interacting with family, friends, nature or anything of that sort. We as a whole need computers to do daily life things, without be able to go online, or save files we would be lost! So I will say again to consider my ideas. Thank you.	4	4	8
2992	2	When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves, because their the ones thats going to the library anyway.                 I believe that everybody is intitle to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed.  For example, some music could be offensive; therefore, I'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries. I'm saying the offensive music should be removed	3	2	3
2993	2	Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are, and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read? I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves.     Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays. If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it.     Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man. Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action. Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face. Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her. Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living. Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting. @CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life.     Just think all that I have told you about, gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people. these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves.	3	3	3
2998	2	Dear news people,     I am qriting to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it's a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.     I don't think it's fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fare and it's a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb.     So to rap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waist time and cause a problem that's my oppion about this problem hope it is yours to.	3	2	3
2999	2	I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 them. Some @CAPS1 feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having. @CAPS1 often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those @CAPS1 can get the books and @CAPS2 them to help them solve there problems.     If the books etc are offensive then, the @CAPS1 who think they are shouldn't get them. The can't control what books are in the library. Some @CAPS1 have problems and some of the books can help them. Alot of @CAPS1 I know dont think that alot of books are offensive. Its eather they want to @CAPS2 them or they dont.      If @CAPS1 think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it. @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 all kinds of books and some dont even like to @CAPS2. For the @CAPS1 who like to @CAPS2 they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with. If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to @CAPS2.      I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. Im sure that they wont do anything about it. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For @CAPS1 To @CAPS2', and to understand what there life is and how to fix it.      You have to control under the books. You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf. In conclusion I think that @CAPS1 should deal with it because they cant control it	3	3	3
3014	2	There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you. Some of these materials @MONTH1 be books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; @CAPS1 people like informational books. Everyone is different in their own way. The material they choose to read is their own choice.           How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or innapropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it their decision to say that some things offend people?                       Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someones music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. Theres a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it.      Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left? The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want. Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy	4	4	4
3017	2	Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive.      The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it.     Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else.     Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves. Never	4	4	4
3020	2	Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even @NUM1 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too.     Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else.     In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading.     Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.          All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc.     But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 thier children get away with everything.      One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world.     So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them. Please think about what I have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this	4	4	4
3022	2	Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books @MONTH1 be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.     First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, @NUM1 year old boy, growing up in an all white town. Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child.      Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about.     Libraries are open to people of all age. It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area	4	3	4
3041	2	There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.     First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof. High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted.     Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone.        Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games. Their lazyness causes obesity. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons. Children being obeast causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late.      In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures. There still time for change, so lets do something about it. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for good	4	4	4
3049	2	Do I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be romoved from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, I think they should be romoved from the shevles if they are found offensive to some or the majority of people. Some can be a bad influence on younger kids. Some can be offensive to someone's race or religion. It could also be offensive to people based on who they are or what they do.                                                                                                                  Some materials should be romoved because of the kind of infuence they have on younger kids. Some books can have violent language and actions in the book. Most magazines have inappropiate articles that they should not be reading or even looking at. The music nowadays are very explicit and do not need to be in hands of kids. Some parents don't even care about the music but it is one of the biggest influential things out. So that's one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be romved from shelves.                                                                                                                                       There are a lot of music and movies that are very offensive to certain races and religion. Hip @CAPS1 is one of the most explicit kinds of music and is very offensive to all kinds of religion and some race of people. Movies are the same with music. Magazines have certain articles that are racist and certain articles that are very offensive to certain religions.                                                                                                                 A lot of magazines have stories about celebreties that are very bad, sad, and private. In the past there have been some celebreties that sued some magazines and newspapers that put the wrong story out or something too private out.                                                                                                               Those are just some ways and reasons why certain books, movies, music and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. No one knows how people feel abouit themselves or things around them	4	3	4
3058	2	All throughout the world there are libraries.  Librairies have all different kinds of materiel stacked upon shelves.  Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not.  I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves.  Yes, i understand some of this material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this.     If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, ect.  I think they should be able to keep them.  Just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone won't like it.  Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions.  Isn't that what makes the world go around?       Adults @MONTH1 have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library.  I understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material.  If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries i think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go.  That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not.       We go to school for a vast amount of reasons.  Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent.  While we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us.  If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies.  We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday.  Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it?     There is alot of different kinds of material in libraries.  Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate.  I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it.  I think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm	3	4	3
3089	2	We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen  @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way.  Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics.  Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway.      If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it?  Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited.  They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words.  This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean.      However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music?  Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand.  Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things.      In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored.  Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines.  Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians.  There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out	3	3	3
3096	2	I belive that they need to keep every thing and gain more. Their is so much to luearn about. The more information you have the better. I for one think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information. Thow you can not trust every thing in one, You can still find many facts about what your wanting to learn about. On the other hand, Children should not be able to reach or see some of this. I could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about. The fact is they need to have people watching the stuff so kids wont get in it and we can still lurean and find out new things. Not everything should be hidden. The more you know could just save the world.	1	1	1
3117	2	Going into a  @CAPS1 everyone has there own opinons as to what they should see on the shelfs, and what should be put out on the shelfs for everyone to see including children of all ages. Some people @MONTH1 agree that there should only be thnigs that is age appropiate for everyone, others disagree.           In my opinion when im looking at this topic, i think that there should be books for everyone to read no matter what the age group, but there should also be a kid section. If parents are so concernced about what types of books their children might see at a library then they could just put them in the children section to view those. There is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety types of books out.          When it comes to looking at magazines, movies, and music i still have the same opinion to a certain aspect. There should be able to be all types of music out on the shelfs, because its not like people can listen to it by looking at the @CAPS2. But my opinion on the magazines, and movies could vary. There is a certain extant for movies, and magazines. I think they should all be aloud on the shelfs, minus any pornography.           The reason i think like this is because, kids should not have that big of an affect on what they place on the shelfs at a library. Parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at , and pay attention to them. But when it does come to the pornography that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library. There is some where to draw the line, in any situation and thats where i think it should be drawn at a library.	3	3	3
3142	2	Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just the few different types of books out there as well as the magazines and music we listen to. With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us but, some of the people that go there are not adults. Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with there parent/guardian. I believe that even though there are some books magazines, and music not attended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive.     Everyone once in their life had to atleast experience something unpleasant. But knowing our world today, we simply can not hide from those things but yet face them, we adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive unlike what our children or other children can do. Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well. It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us.      If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area. And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they @MONTH1 sit and read there favorite books as well with you by there side where you can watch there every move. And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see.      Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life. Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn there heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said. But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they @MONTH1 read and things they can't.     Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and @MONTH1 not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library. If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit and go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you an expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library	4	4	4
3143	2	To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive i believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This book or music @MONTH1 be offensive but everyone is intitled to their own opinon. People have all the freedom to read, listen or watch anything that is approperite to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what @MONTH1 offend others.      Also from my own exprience i have read a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the stadges of our history where they were salves and were hung for their punishment. It @MONTH1 offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others @MONTH1 find it interesting to go back a learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are rascist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy. If you chose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that @MONTH1 offend someone then it shouldn't be removed, if you would like to read, watch or listen to anything that @MONTH1 offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it.        Therefore, i conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves. Everyone @MONTH1 have their own opinon or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries. It is for their own benifit, not for yours. It is up to you to decide wheather or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsable and have to removed anything open to the people that @MONTH1 just be part of our background	3	3	3
3148	2	i believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. The reason why I say that is because of our first amenment which is freedom of speech we should be able to put anything in books, magazines,music,movies, and etc.. The other reason why we shouldn't take them off the shelf is because we should be able to tell if the book is good enough for your age or your viewings, depends on your point of views.     My first reason is the first amenment which is freedon of speech. The reason why I say that is because we should be able to but what ever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way shape or form. Also, if we start taking stuff away because of censorship in books it will go farther than that and it will come to a point where the first amenment will become cease.      In my culmination I have made my point that there shouldn't be any censorship in anything because of the first amenment. I also said the reason why we shouldn't have censorship is because it's another way to express yourself or your point of views.	3	3	3
3149	2	You know when you find a @LOCATION1 book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind see. Or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word. I see it more better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them stuff like will make the child think that's how your suppose to act and talk. Here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines.     First, in deal with music children word immate act they see and the words the say. One good example is rap music: their song have cuss words in them and believe me when I tell you this that I have to constantly to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this. In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines.     Second, with magazine some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are ment to be seen where children read. an example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from magazine I found a magazine on the table and it show three of the cast members from @LOCATION1 in their birthday suits. I thought what in the world is this doing at my school they should have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud. What do they think it want bother any kids' parent about it that I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had a something that at there school.     In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them.	3	3	3
3150	2	Freedom of press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown. To censorize the right to write freely about ones outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past.     Before todays technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to recieve one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information, they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone.      In the brilliant novel, @CAPS1 @NUM1 a man who lives in a distopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediatly taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and distruction as in the novel.      Having the right to know about your countries history or what is going on in your current government is critical in shools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf perminatly, there would be no more books. Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good.      Books are a history in themselves, no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavory or the possibility of a complete government take over. In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply chose a more ficition novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, however they can exagorate certain events and without the actual book or cite it came from, one could completely alter the publics view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it.      Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off ones talent is a privlage. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrevelent, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always strech the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people. The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades	4	4	4
3166	2	Every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience.  Unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it @MONTH1 not be something that they are supposed to be reading.  When an author writes a childrens book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult.  Also when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the authr is talking about and can act maturely while reading it.  Although some novels @MONTH1 not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not they way to fix that, and it is a big mistake.     As humans we are given certain freedoms, and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press.  Authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about.  If they choose to write about subject's that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries.  Even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are. If you take those books away because your scared that a child might get ahold of one, then your taking away what certain people enjoy reading.     Due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors.  They have a children's section made primarily for children,an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read and a teen section for everyone in between.  By having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books.  Having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it @MONTH1 be, and cutting out certain books all together.     If a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want.  If a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive.  Instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like.  If a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out.     Censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered.  Whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries	4	4	4
3169	2	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views.     A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightnement. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on @CAPS5 but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? @CAPS1 goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another.      Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inapropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not aloud to roam the library without an adult. @CAPS1 is a very prominant rule because it sets boudaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults.      Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries beacuse they are found offensive becuase @CAPS1 is censorship and it takes away our rights.	3	3	3
3182	2	There are many diffrent people in this world, who have many diffrent oppions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc., @CAPS1 because one person dose not perticualy like horor movies, that dose not mean that movies stores should remove horor films from there shelves. as creepy as it @MONTH1 sound. there are many people in the world who are slasher film freeks. the live and breath scarry movies. I myself like @CAPS1 about eveything out there. i will read any book of listen to any type of music, it actualy widens my taste in certain materials. i feel like everyone should try new things. Say growing up your favorite books were @CAPS2 The @CAPS3. and you would like to shaire your childhood stories with your children. BUT @CAPS4, books stores took @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This is nonsince. many people like many diffrent things.there is no reason to only sell what you like. otherwise your busines will fail.	2	2	2
3195	2	Library Censorship     Everyone has their favorite book. But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it? Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain.     As americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music. But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as an american citizen.      Personally, I hate rap. I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings. But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it. Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed?     One of my favorite series is the @PERSON2 series, by @PERSON1. It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growning up by depending on @CAPS1, and it helped me do the same. But because it is a @CAPS2 series, should it be removed from shelves? Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive?     Although some wish they could elimate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work. However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it. Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid. Libraries are suppost to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive.	4	4	4
3202	2	Books that are found offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. Books tell stories fiction or non-fiction. Many books that @MONTH1 be found offensive are historical. These books could include topics such as wars, eras, people, ect. Everyone has the same rights to read any book they want. They also have the right to not read the book at all.      Books that are taken off the shelves of a library because of one person, or a group of people, being offended henders the ability of someone who wants to read the book, to read the book. We, as people, should not be able to take this right away from other people. They should be able to read anything they want. If someone wants to read a biography or history about @CAPS1, they should be able to.      The topic of @CAPS1 and the @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 be found to be offensive because of what they stand for. If we look at the topic as purely a historical reference not as a story to be read for enjoyment there will never be any offence in these books. These stories have a large role in history. If we do not learn from their mistakes, history @MONTH1 repeat itself. History is around to be studied, even if the topics might be offensive to some people.     Political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story. Such as in To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4. This book has many issues when it comes to political correctness. These issues include; the killing of an innicent man and revealing the flaws in our judicial system, the use of the word 'nigger' to describe the black characters, and the racial unequality of the @LOCATION1 duringthe @DATE1's. These issues would deffinately be offensive to some readers, but this book is an award winner and uses history as a guide. The situations in this novel are ones that could be real. They are things we must learn about, so we do not repeat them.     Another story that fits quite well into this topic is @CAPS5 @NUM1. This novel is about a world where all books are burnt. No books are allowed to be read by the people. This book reveals the removal of offensive books to its exteme. No matter who you are or what you believe, there will be some topics that you find offensive. If we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library. A library is not a library wihout its books.     If we allow books to begin to be removed from the shelves, we will not be able to stop it. One day we will end up like the world in @CAPS5 @NUM1. No history will be know but what is passed down. No more stories will be here to entertain us, but the ones memorized. No books will exzist and this world would be terrible without books.     Books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. The taking away of these books takes away the freedom to read anything you want. It reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish. Political correctness should not take the place of our own freedom, and as long as we keep our books on their shelves, it won't	5	4	5
3211	2	All people have the same right to read, listion and watch different materials. To be censored should be no one choise but your own. For some one else to tell you what and what not to read is by my openion very wrong to do. If we would censore everything we did we would have a city and nation that would @DATE1 slowly.   Any givein word can offend any certain person. The people that they offend are in my oppioen are the dead weights of our country that are just holding us back from fully ecpressing our self, the colorfull words that we @MONTH1 use can be offensive to one persson yet perfeectly fine to another. It all depends on the indivadual that likes or dislikes the word or readings. In my observations of people reading and dislikeing it because of it harsh and colorfull words is most offen people that do not fully express them selvs and our yet much more senitive. I think this also goes agenst freedom of speech. We were gaven that right so why wouldent we use it? Why wouldent people want us to express ourselvs? I have no idea why any person would want to take books,music,movies and magazines away from us. If every thing went by one mans rule of what to and not to read we would down grade as a country and @DATE1. Therefore i strongly advise not to take any books off the selves. The majordy of the people agree with me to not be censored and only the sensitive people that they offened will just make there own chiose not to pick the book off the selves,not to listen to music, And pick up the magazine. the right is ours and thats how is should stay	3	3	3
3223	2	There are different types of books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders in libraries. Books can be fiction or nonfiction. However, books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read. So therefore, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf.      Who picks out the books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders? The answer is the customers at the library. The authors of the books or items did not. The authors gave the decision to choice between books or items. No one can blame the authors. Also, there are different kinds and different types of writtters or artists. Writters and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear. People should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be nonfiction are fiction.      My next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offensed someone but not to others. For example slavery can offensed a colored person but to others it is just a historical event. People need to know what happened in the past with historical events. People need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not. Therefore, people should not try to remove it.                    If a child checks out a book and their parents let them, it is the parents fault. It is there fault because parents let their child check the items out. Also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then complain but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf. Like I said before, one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it.           Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not to remove books or other source off the shelves.	3	3	3
3226	2	Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed.       Take music for example, there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it.     Movies @MONTH1 be different. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it.     Books @MONTH1 be the only exception. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about. which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else.       There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision.	4	4	4
3251	2	If everyone in the world could permantly take a book, movie,music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive would there be any of those thing left for us to enjoy?      I personally think that if people could do that they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? No, it might not be, so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanatly so no one else can read it? I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it.     If anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people? I dont think there would be. Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. Thus it shouldnt be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it.     On the other hand I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that has offensive language and that they would not want there children hearing or reading that but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then? You can just take that person out of the world.     So I guess the point im trying to get across is that just because you think its offensive and dont like it doesnt mean everyone in the world thinks that. To end my acticle I want you to think about whats offensive to you @MONTH1 not bee the same for others.	3	3	3
3253	2	If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.      As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.      However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, @CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests.      This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their @CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.      I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or @CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened. This is why I feel books should stay where there are	4	4	4
3255	2	If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material.  Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction.  No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way.  Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional?     Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others @MONTH1 have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way. Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion.     The cenorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong.  You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it.      I go to the library once in a while,and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel  the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down.  I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me?  I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that someone else's opinion and not my own.      If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it	3	4	3
3270	2	I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language.     Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it.      Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them. I think that cencorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere.	3	3	3
3282	2	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3:     @CAPS4 I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries.  And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation.  There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate.  Many people have differnt opinions then other people. Everyone had a differnt point of view and sees things differently.  Ecspecially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.     I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate.  The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it.  And if she finds it not approprite then she has the right to take it off the shelf.     If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not apropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library.  Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area.       I have actaully had an experience with this.  At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate.  When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books.  The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library.  So she had a great idea.  She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk.  If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book.  It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldnt even see them.  And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.     Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material.  Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in.     I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone.  Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too.  I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme.  There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoyes the stuff there.  There should be action,adventure, humor, love, etc.  Talk to people and see what they like.  And just because one person complains, dont take it out right away because to another person they might love it.  Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped	4	4	4
3283	2	i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc.	3	3	3
3332	2	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I do not believe they should be, but that is my opinion.     It is pointless to remove them from the shelves because the children are going to see that kind of material outside of school, so why should we remove it? Music, movies, magazines, and books all have material such as; racism, murders, innopropriate language, etc. When we find materials, like those listed before offensive outside of school, we stay away from them. We ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive.      Movies and books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are sometimes found offensive to some people and if we remove them from our libraries then we can not have references for when we right essays over those topics. It would be hard to get the right kind of information off the internet because not everything is correct on there. One hundred percent of factual books is correct. You will have no worries then.     Therefore, I do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed. It is a pointless task to do. Children see it outside of school and stay away from it then so they can stay away from it in school also.	3	3	3
3333	2	Censorship in Libraries      I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Just because some people think it's offensive doesnt't mean all people think it's offensive. Some people @MONTH1 like the content it shows.        I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view. If something was removed every time someone would walk in, then there would be no library. A library is supposed to be a variety of books. It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes.        It is important to offer alot of variety because if a library doesn't have alot of variety, then the library would lose all kinds of customers. A library doesn't want to target just kids or teen through aduts. The library wants to target all aspects of people. Even if it means that some content is innapropriate. All books are innapropiate if you look at them in the wrong way.       I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Everyone has their own point of view. A library should have a variety of books. Not just one genre a person wants.	3	3	3
3336	2	Their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship. From past exsperian with censorship I found out it can towne down a book. In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1 for exsample the books are being burnt and it is causing socity to fall apart. Censorship is from people with a more ethnich back ground that dont want the kids to grow up and see unappopreat langue.      The most recent book that I have heard of geting censored is @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The main word they are removing from this book is nigar because some people fined this word very ofinceve to their race. The comittys are trying to remove the books from school shelfs.     I think we should not have censorship just because parents do not want their kids to hear the words in school or read them when eventualy the kids will learn the words on their own or hear the words some were eles. The kids can even learn the word from their own parrent or from t.v. I personaly think that comittys should stop trying to censor every thing because they wont be able to sencer how adults talk when they are around chindren and younger adults	3	2	3
3339	2	There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do?      Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music	4	4	4
3341	2	Libraries should have whatever they want in the library. Everyone has their on thoughts on things. If you don't like what they have on there shelfs then don't go there any more or pick up something you like. Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else.      Materials, such as book, music, movies, magazines you can't just start taking stuff of the shelves just because there offensived you. The only way I would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right.       Libraries hold almost anything anybody needs materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everythings for facts. So don't start taking stuff off your shelves. Teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is affensive, if you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts. No one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you taking of offensive.Libraries are open to any one that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about.       Music everybody has there on type of music you can't just start taking music of because you think it's offensive. Most people have there own type of everything.     Children is there own person you can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life. They get older you won't be able to tell them want to do or want not to do. If you keep them from a book or etc they might end up reading it in the long run. Keep you kids safe is inpormant I understand your kids are going to expirects things you don't want them to. Just by taking offensive stuff of the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't fine them some where else.      I could understand if the books or magazines were offensive to you because it was about your family, But of time your going to have offensive come up in your life. That means your going to have to not let it get under you skin or get over it.      Things get under people skin to easy. This is why the world don't get along. If you don't like something don't me around it. Fine something unless to read about. Thats what I do if I don't like something.	3	3	3
3374	2	Have you ever found a book offensive? Many people can say they have. They might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text. When this happens, people stop reading the book and other books in the same category. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone has opinions, what would be left without books?     At my public library, citizens of my city can request certain books, movies, music, or magazines to be put on the shelves. We are very blessed to have this available because if someone cannot afford cerain books, they can always rely on the library. Many people have been very thankful for this system.      If certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive, what would happen? More people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest. Everyone is titled to their own opinions. Just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library. There are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library, that does not mean you have to read all of them. There are also many different genres of novels, movies, music, and magazines. Everyone has interests in different types. If people all liked the same things, would not life be boring?     In conclusion, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries is they are found offending to certain people. Everyone is titled to their own opinions. If a specific book is requested and one person finds it offending, the book should stay in the library. There are many different genres of books, music, movies, and magazines. Imagine if the library did not have a certain type of novel you enjoyed, would you continue to go?	4	4	4
3376	2	Materials should not be removed from libraries. It should be left up to a person to decided what the see or view. Books, music, movies, etc., are materials used by everyone and for some a library provide a haven where the can get there hands on such things only and no where else, so shouldn't try to take away any of these things from any body.     One reason why certain materials should not be removed from libraries shelfs is that there will always be some subjects, and materials that a great many people will argue shouldn't be seen, and there will always be other people who feels differently. And if we allow them to be taken away you will only be taking away a person own choice, which is something we all should strieve not to do. Also just who would be left to decide what material should be removed and what material shouldn't? Is there really one person who could make a such a choice for everyone? Also there is no way everyone could agree on what material should be removed, so by trying you would just be providing something more for everyone to argue on. I believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother.     Another reason why in libraries certain materials shouldn't be removed is that by removing certain materials you would be interfering with education. Books, movies and other such things are used for learning even weather people realize it or not, and the more oppuntunties a person has to learn the better. And who are we to decide what a person decides to educate themselves about? There has infact been times in history when people in charge have wrongly decide that the public should not be educate or know about certain things and it was wrong then and it would be even more wrong now in our modern society. A society that is based on learning and knowledge, a socity that in situration should not hinder a persons ability to learn.     Also I realize some people @MONTH1 argue that for young children some materials are better left unviewed, but that's is where parents come in. It's there resoponsibility to decide what their children read or see and not anyone elses. And so there is no reason why anyone should interfere with a parents choice as long as it is in aggrement with the law.      These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't be allowed to decided what materials and subjects are put on their shelfs. For some dicsion no one can make to satify everyone and to be in the right. Therefore it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves.	4	4	4
3377	2	I do not beleive that certain materials such as books, music,, movies, magazines and ect. should be remove, unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books. Because some books and movies are bad to show little kids. But i think we should have anything, that teaches you something in the labrary. plus people have to do reports and homework on some books, and if its about something with a little cussing and kinda graphic it should be ok. i think if the library have these kind of books, movies, music and magazines they should let you if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher that you need that book, or some kind of rule that lets you choice any kind of book but with permission.     The library's would have more people going if they had more books and better ones. Because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have. So it just depends on the situation. There is a lot of offensive things out there, it doesnt mean you can keep it away from people. They will find out anyways sooner or later. I think its unnessary for the libraries to do that. I always hate when i try to get something when you find out you have to be @NUM1 or older or have an adult with you. plus some people dont have computers or enternet excess, so they cant look up things easly. They have to drive down to the library to look something up and if you are lucky they might have the thing you are looking for at the library, but if they dont that sucks. So thats my opinion about have offensives things on the shelves.	2	2	2
3378	2	People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries. They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why.     I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen. let them do what they want to	3	3	3
3380	2	No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. You have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to. Certain books, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed just because someone else doesn't like it.     If someone of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion, then they have an option to not read or look at it. Something that someone might find offensive might be interesting to someone else or they might have to do an report or project on it. There's no need to discrimanate against a book or movie just because a certain religion group or someone as an individual doesn't approve of it.     It's an public library that has materials on display for the public! Any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please. A library is open to the public which means people of differenrent races, beliefs, religions etc., is going to come through and it's a possibilty that they're going to see something offensive or that they don't like. They have the option of either picking it up and reading it or the option of not paying it any attention and ignoreing it.     The choice is theirs to either let someone elses's opinion actually bother them or not let their opinion matter at all and just keep doing their own thing. People have to be strong enough to rise above all the negetivity and keep doing thier thing and keep believing in what they believe in. It doesn't matter if someone hates or have hateful things to say about you or your perticular. Don't pay them no mind at all.     I know you think censorship should be in public libraries, but that isn't fair to the people that are maybe being offended but they don't have to read it if they don't want to. They need to learn that in life there's going to be people that don't like. Even peoplr that @MONTH1 have hurtful or hateful comments to say about you. Learn to be strong enough to stand tall in what you believe in and don't let haters or other peoples opinions bring you down	3	3	3
3392	2	Everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship. Some people don't like books and movies with profanity in it, but some other people @MONTH1. Also somebody @MONTH1 like the scary mystery books and movies, but others @MONTH1 not. I think all movies, music, and books are acceptable.     I can understand why some people @MONTH1 want to remove some movies or books from the libraries. They want to because they are inappropriate, but the thing is, they are not inappropriate to everyone. A lot of people like the books and the movies with profanity in them because it brings out the real in the book.      Personally I think that some magizines need to just stop being made. For example; @CAPS1 magizines are horrible to me. There is nothing but nude women in there. I say that the women don't respect themselves enough to cover up, but there are other opinions. Others @MONTH1 think it is creative and beautiful how the women look in the magizines, and it isn't jus magizines it's movies also. More and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies.     Everybody has their on opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want. I think if you are offended by a movie, music lyric, book, or a magizine don't read or watch it	3	4	3
3398	2	Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries? Censorship in libraries are a touchy subject. Many people with young children believe that some books should just not be allowed in the libraries, while others believe that because it is a book, no matter what, it should be allowed to be in the library. Who knows, someone @MONTH1 need to write a paper over that certain 'touchy' book. I think, personally, that as long as the book is in a proper section, it sould be okay for a person, of the right age, to be able to get that book or other material.     The libraries should have a certain area for children's books and another area for adult or teenage level reading or material. This way, there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager. The library in the town that I live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers. This way, young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading.     If people are concerned about someone being to young to read or view the material, the library can also put an age restriciton on the material. This way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material. The people who are of proper age will be able to get the material, however.      Libraries are very important sources for studing in many people's lives. If people did not have a library, they @MONTH1 not be able to research a paper, or something else, that they need to get finished. I feel if people do not like the material that they see in their local library, then they should just not look at it or borrow the material from the library. I do feel, however, that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stuble upon a book with disturbing material. There, in my opinion, needs to be a room with said materials that children have, in no way, access to. This way, children are not able to access the material, but they are still able to go into the library without their parents feeling that the children @MONTH1 see something unsuitable for them.     I feel that those people who love reading should be able to go into a library, and not be afraid of if they are going to see a book containing material they believe to be unsuitable. I also feel that if I need to research something that is deemed, by others, to be offensive, I should somehow be able to research my subject. Also, if I was the author of a book that was said to be 'bad,' i would not want my book to be taken away, so that no one could read it, or study and learn from it.      I do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly. We all have the freedom of speech, so why not let the authors of the materials have that same freedom. There are procautions that parents and people who do not want to see this literature can take. Total censorship, I feel, would not allow for people to broaden their minds. If people just take procautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials, that someone worked very hard on for everyone to see	4	4	4
3414	2	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, do not need to be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive.  There are multiple reasons to back up this statement, including an accurate quote from author Katherine Paterson.     People build their character through their reactions of how people treat them.  For example, in life sombody @MONTH1 offend another person, but that does not mean the offender is going to dissapear after doing so.  How does this relate to libraries you might ask?  Books and movies do not need to be taken off of shelves in libraries if they are found offensive because there are a lot of things in the real world that are offensive.       It is your choice in what you want to read, listen to, or watch.  Just because you @MONTH1 have the option of checking out something you do not think is appropriate or is offensive, does not mean you have to check it out.  Some people @MONTH1 enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive.     You @MONTH1 be wanting to argue, 'But I don't want my children being exposed to such offensive materials.'  That is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections.  If you happen to come across an offensive book in the childrens section, then do not let your child check that out.  It is as simple as that.  Trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time.       The quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', by Katherine Paterson, is a perfect example to conclude the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelf.  She is saying that if one person is allowed to remove a book, then anybody else would be able to have that ablitiy as well.  Therefore, a book that @MONTH1 not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it.  Eventually, there would be no books left.       In conclusion, if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, simply do not check them out.  You do not need to get rid of them because somebody else @MONTH1 want to check them out	4	4	4
3424	2	Regardless of if we are speaking of the religous demanding books such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series to be ripped from our shelves or @CAPS3 wanting to burn the @LOCATION1, books can always bring about controversy. In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so.     Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future.      Imagine the impact if the @CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the @CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place.     While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading '@ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music @MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they @MONTH1 speak a message. To a creationist @PERSON1's views @MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they @MONTH1 be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own.      We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another.	4	4	4
3428	2	First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. We have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time. From the @CAPS1 regime of @LOCATION1 to the banning of @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 empire. It always is a terror that falls violently.     Farenheit @NUM1 was written by @PERSON1 in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity. The human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told. In this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book. Their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness. As if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end.     Man must know his foundation and where he comes from. All it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf. Eventually they all will start coming down til there are none. The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous. When the malignant being is the government itself.     This all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions. What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? We have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it.     I, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. People have the right to know everything. Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so. Let man choose what is intolerable to him. Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. All freedoms are taken away by that one word. The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. The communists censored everything inside the @CAPS4 @CAPS5.     History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. The people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes. Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies.     A word is simply a word. People will always have their own views on everything. Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. The day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want. It is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest. What will become of the uncertain future?	6	4	6
3434	2	Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1'm writing your newspaper company this letter because @CAPS2 the same way Katherine Paterson feels, and we should not be able to have any of the following books @NUM2,and any sexual books. Because they can scar a kids mind forever, so in my opinion any books with thatstuff in the book should not be on the self for any public library. Also we should have more sensory in books with inaproprite speaking because it can give a person a change in thought.Also let me give you a example,lets say a little boy asks were the action books are, the libarien would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading this books an the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book an my big brother said it a good book too. And in my opinion that is all I need to say.Sincerly your customer @PERSON2.	2	2	2
3437	2	If you get offended because of a book, magazine, music, or movies than don't read, watch, or listen to it. America shouldn't be censored.     Censorship should be fo young childen. If your grown and get offended by something having the '@CAPS1-word' on it then don't read it. If a movie drops the '@CAPS1-bomb' then don't watch it. i completly disagree with someone wanting to remove vulgar words.     I don't get offeneded by swearing because its usually used in a funny way, like telleing jokes, or it makes a crappy song good. Censoship is helpful, but vulgar things shouldn't be removed from society, and it never will.          More often than not, kids learn cuss words fom paents or friends. If you don't want your kid to cuss or be surrounded by cussing then remove them from that situation. It's the parents responsibility to protect or 'censor' a childs environment.	3	3	3
3438	2	The books in the libraries that I have read so far dont seem like they would be offensive to anyone and I havn't really listen to the music in the libraries or watch the movies and the magazines seem fine to.  That doesnt mean that there isn't any of those that can be offensive to other people but if there is then I think that they should take them out of the libraries but I think if someone found something like that they would probably just put it back and not go there again.     If they took out every book, music, movies, and magazines that people thought were offensive then I bet alot of them would be out and that wouldnt be fair to other people because maybe they want or listen or read or watch them and they would be really mad if they found out they was taken out because other peoplr thought they were offensive.  Some people would probably understand that some of those could hurt someones feelings or be offensive to other people but then theres other ones that dont care.     I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad and I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and gettin their feelings hurt or anything but if there not that bad then I don't they should be gone and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in them.  If thiers ones that are really bad and if they stayed in the libraries then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries and sooner or later less and less people would stop going.      So the best thing to probably do is just take them out and keep the people that keep going in the libraries because alot of people enjoy reading and thats what they do for fun and they would be really upset if they couldnt go no more over something that stupid	3	4	3
3452	2	Do you think that certain books should not be shared with certain poeple? In all honesty yes, let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting. No matter what the content that the book or @CAPS1 contains it's their choice, there is a power called freedom in this world. One might think that if you are able to read and comprehend the words that are wrote in that book or sang in a song, then yes read and listen to anything you want.     If a young person such as a kindergartener picks up a book about sex you know there is no way that child will be able to comprehend it. So yes any books should be left on the shelf at libraries, open to anyone and everyone who are willing to read them. Its not that you have to be mature enough to read a book its that you have to understand it and are able to read to get what the book is trying to say. Yes some things parents don't want their children to know, but this world is filled with awful things and they are bound to figure some of those horrible things out sooner or later. Reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before. Both books and songs are a way to express yourself and everyone should express theirself in some way.     When it comes to movies that's a different story. Those movies are rated for a reason. On a rated @CAPS2 film i could see @NUM1 year olds on up watching it, because by then those kids have been in high school and everything sexual and perverted have been put into their little heads. Also most have been in sex education class. Blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too. So yes let @NUM1 year olds on up watch rated @CAPS2 films. The one thing that isn't suggested is taking a little kid to see a film that isn't rated for them. Say a parent took a @NUM3 year old to see a scarry movie, more than likely that child is going to be scared and scarred from see blood, stabbing, and sexual content.    Movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for. When it comes to music and books, they are wonderful learning tools also good for expression of ones self. So learn, experience, and express. No matter what your interested in freedom was gave to you so use it	3	4	3
3475	2	I as a student, a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book, should be allowed in any library.  Books, express feelings, emotions ect., the same thing with movies, music.  I we don't have them how will we be able to learn anything in this world. Each book out there has an explanation, a title and a reason to be read.  Today millions of poeple read more ad more because of all the books out there.            I do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different.  It doesn't matter what the books about, some might seem offensive but everyone has something that they dislike.  There are many poeple out there that get deffensive over things, for example certain people, animals, countries, different skin colors, cursing and even sports.  We all have our own opinions, if you do not like a certain book because it has a content that you don't like then it's simple don't read it, others might like it.  Movies, books, music, magazines, etc., should be allowed anywhere	2	3	2
3480	2	Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age?  No it is not the whole situation of wether or not libraries should have things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to certain people due to there age should not be an issue.  My reasoning on that is not because of how it @MONTH1 influence people in a bad way.  Then again it @MONTH1 influence them in a fantastic way.          Thats how people find out who they are such as, what their interested in, what they like, and what they want to do.  If it wasnt for establishments such as libraries most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves. People would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others.  People should be aware of some of the content in books. Just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups.  Movies and cds are more understandable do to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicans and actors @MONTH1 use.  Except in a book its not what other people are doing and saying its what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interperating it.  It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it.     Thats why the whole situation of wether or not libraries certain things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to a certain age group, but instead having the ares labeled on what the category is to know before looking.  So therefor that is my views and beleifs on why or why not libraries should be restricted to certain people.	3	3	3
3482	2	All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age.  The books on the shelf are arranged or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first.  I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, mvies, should be removed due to some of the graphics in each reading material.     Every bookshelf should be arranged by age difference and spread apart from the other books and or bookshelfs.  If a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books, less children would pick up the wrong book.  If children would understand to listen and follow dircections on where to find there specific age appropriate books, less accidents of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur.     If children would take the wrong age appropriate book off the bookshelf, I would think that their parent(s) would be responsible and take it back and get the right book for their child(s).  If parents would be responsible for taking action, their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf.  Wouldn't children understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back, that they would learn not to do it again?     I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material.  The books on each bookshelf are or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first.  All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age.	3	2	3
3484	2	I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books, music, movies and magazines. Some of the books people need to know about. Take the consentration camps for instince, people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happining again.     I think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed. So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger. They can be in danger by someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of jews just because they look diferent. Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesnt mean they are not human. So keeping them in shelves could help our future.     Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply dont listen/watch them but let other people who is interested in them learn. My mom thinks that bloody-scarry movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but i told her that thats what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever.     In conclution, we should keep some of these bad books, music, movies and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horible historical events form happining again	3	4	3
3494	2	NO, I think books and ect. should be tooking down off selves if they are offensive! It's a free country and they have they will to freedom of speech. No one can think for nobody so everybody's going to have their opioin. As long as it's  apporiate for the enviroment and its surronds ,there should'nt be any  problems.                                                                                                   If we took down the books people said offened them we would'nt have any books left. Everyone has their own opioin about things and diffrent views. It's most likely that someones goin to get offened. In some cases it makes a person better at wat their doing to be offened. Some offensive things are part of @CAPS1 and shows how things progressed from back then to now. What's a child without it's @CAPS1?             Out of all the people who should be mad or think they should be offened is the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ,but their not complaining about the books and etc. then no one should. You know jus as well as I know that most of the movies are about how we got whipped and sold back in slavery.Books about how only a couple of us made it. Magazines about how we sex and kill each other. Papper telling how are black communties are failing.                So in my opioin, no books should be tooken of the shelfs if there found offenisve. It was going on before we got here and when we leave it's still going to be going on. It's apart of @CAPS1 and there's no better way to find out about things if you don't see it yourself. People always saying kids should read more. What's to read if you take all the books down thats offensive?	2	3	2
3519	2	Some books are offensive to some people. But eveyrone has the right to read any book they want. I believe we shouldnt censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find offensive from the beggining, find another book to read or talk to the teacher.           I have had my experience with books who are offensive to me. Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. But that same book i have read might be interesting to other people. Whatever doesnt @CAPS1 you makes you stronger, right? So don't take a book in a hurtful way. Books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people.      I had poeple come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience. Specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. I told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her. Thats all you have to do and not make anything big about it.      I also read the book, 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2', which is censored in some states because its hurtful to some people. The story is about a white family trying to help an @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man who was accused of raped when he never commited such thing. That was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him. Its a great story about what black poeple went through in earlier years. And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive.      He got harrased and his children got harrased but he still fought with all he had to save his deffendant. I am a @NUM1 year old boy who when he read this book knowing who had a heart and who didnt made me cry my eyes out. It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is defenitely one of the best books i have ever read and also the only one that got to me. It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway.      I feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people. They might not even test it anyways. They might just say its gonna offend this kinda people and thats it. How do they cokme up with it? Do they let everybody read it once? No, and they should just leave it whoever doesn't read it doesnt have to or they can talk with their teacher. Its not so hard to decide to censor something when its only your opinion. Thats why i would look into the opinion of others.     All in all censorship shouldn't be allowed. It ruins the oppurtonity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. Let the kids read atleast in highschool when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want	4	4	4
3527	2	There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward. But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect.      People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid. I'm very into music and some music I dont listen to because of the things in it but I dont let that music or magazines change my option on things. I dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them. I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. If people can get offended off of a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things.      With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies	4	4	4
3581	2	Hi im henry and I agree that if there are books in a school libray or a public libray that are offensive they should be removed. im a type of person who belives that offensive books shouldnt be in librays because i ahte seeing people upset or mad  because they read a book that effened them. That inclues magazines and movies and even music.       myself henry has read a few books that has effened my self or has made fun of black people and i have black friends. if I could have it my way i would have all books like that out of school librays and public librays. And i say that because little kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff and neither do we. thats just like music now days you turn on a radio station and people are cussing and making fun of other colored people. Also you cant understand what there saying half the time. They need to put on music that u can understand that doesnt have cussing in it and that you can understand because some kids like to listen to music.     magazines, I look at alot of magazines my self but there all like coonhunting magazines or four-wheeler ones lookin for tires or somthing like that. but yes also the bad magazines need t go to that way little kids arent looking at them. also it mite help some crime to stop to. I say that because people look at magazines that have shooting in then and that have crime in them to. So people see that and there like i wanna try this somtime. so then they call there buddies and say lets try this and most of them do then there in trouble. so i think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things mite change. make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids. you could even try and make some good health ones that advertise good health for people and teens. To me things would possibly change if we get all the  naughty things out of book,magazines,music.     Movies, this is a big one just about all the movies are bad. There are some good ones out there if u look. but i dont know how we could change the movies by anycahnce at all.     That was my opion on things. i hope it all makes sense about how i feel and how i think about things.	3	3	3
3585	2	Should we take off books that are offensive? I think that we should not take them out if they are offensive. If we do take off the offensive stuff off the self then there are not any more on the self. If all of us could take off the book, movie, or music that in fensive to us then there will be no books, movies, or music on the self.     First off all, there will be no war books, movies, or music on the self. All the hippys will take the war stuff off because they dont like war. They will say that it infensive on them on take them off. I think that we should read about war and witch them because it is a good way to learn our mistake. If we don't learn the mistake of war we will lose and we wont learn how we loss and we will go into war over and over again we will win some and lose alot because we wont learn how we lost.     Secondly, all the music that are good and bad will be taken off the self. All the mothers that are to protactive they will take them done. It have bad language in it and a bad theme to it. If they take them down how can the football players, solders, and fighters can be ready for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to and get pump for the fight.     Finally, they will take out all thethe books of star wars and forgetten ralms. Some people don't like them because they think that it wont come true and they will take them out and say that it infensives them on there thinking wise. Star wars is a good book and movie and forgetten ralms is a good book maker company.     All of this is why i don't want this to happen. All the good music, books, and movies well go away and the people who like them well get mad.	3	3	3
3598	2	Reading it is a joy to some and a pain to others. Do I think objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or taken off the shelves? There are some things that could be censored, and others that wouldn't be worth using if it was censored. However, yes I do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored. I am going to tell you why they should be censored, and what should be censored.     The types of items in the library that shouldn't be cleaned up.  A perfect example of those items are historical documentaries or historical books they have no other way to get the information needed across to the reader or viewer. There are other types of library items in the library that could be censored. Like there are some magazines and movies that show uncensored scenes or pages that are not need to make a view across if there even is a view to get across. I think a movie, book, or a magazine should only be uncensored if it is trying to get a point across. If there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library.      As people can see library there are circumstances where a book, movie, or magazine uncensored is very useful in getting information. There are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive. If you ask me if I think censorship is important in libraries than I would have to say yes and no. I just gave you some reasons why I would say that. The next time you are in the library looking for a book ask your self one question is it to offensive to be important.	3	3	3
3599	2	Have you ever imagine goin to the libary and getting a magazine from the shelve and you find it offensive and you cant do anything about it? Well now you can say what ever you want because Katherine Paterson and me when to a libary together we pick out magazine from the shelve and it had alot of offensive stuffs we did not like. We went to the lady infront and she dint even knew this magazines where there.  She got really mad and when back to the shelve and there where alot of magazines with offensive ritting, pictures and even comments. We got all of the magazined anf threw them away. In my own opin i think these kind of things thar are offensive like movies, music, and magazines should be remove.     They should be remove because it a bad influence to the younth, and it gives them a picture in there head and they do it later or maybe say it to the plubic or even so it in there homes. They should be remove because its getting alot of people in to trouble and making them do what they see of it, this is getting to kids and they becoming more violent to there school, friends and even moms. We have to remove all of these offensive stuffs becasue we see these every where and its easy to find like in the movies it getting to the piont where you see naked girls in every movie. The parents have to do something about it to because they are the one who are buying them and then leaving it every where in the house and its easy for the children to find it.     We have to be more care full about what we but or what we read because you can find it offensive and then your kids @MONTH1 read it and they would think another thing. So next time you buy or go some where and you find some thing offensive talk to the manager or the supervacer about taking it off. That why i think they should be remove	3	3	3
3621	2	Should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive? Personally I don't think they should be. If @CAPS3 is something in the book that is remotelly offensive towards children then it should be put under a section for adults only.  Most libraries I have been to have different areas for each age group. If @CAPS3 is a book that is racially unexceptable then it should be put in the adult section not anywhere for children.      When a book is being questioned if it is offensive or not they should review all the possibilities of how someone @MONTH1 comprehend the story to see their reaction with it. @CAPS3 are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so @CAPS3 is always a place that the book can go to. Most of the questioning about a book is the language in it. For example, in @CAPS1 we just finished reading the book '@CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 is a lot of question if the book should be read in schools or not because of the 'n-word'. It is a very harsh word, but it goes with the setting and the background of the story. When someone is not sure if a book is acceptable or not they should take in concideration what the story is about and whether or not the word is needed or not. In many cases the unexceptable thing @MONTH1 work along with the story.     If one book is being questioned about something wrong with it then shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned? If something is not allowed for one item then it shouldn't be allowed for something else. It is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it. I have read many books that have certain words that don't bother me, but someone else who isn't use to it @MONTH1 not like. Some parents don't want their kids hearing foul language or inappropriate stuff from the type of music they listen to. It all comes down to who reads the book or magazine, and who listens to the music. Katherine Paterson makes a very good point about how if we start taking the books off of the shelves then eventually @CAPS3 wouldn't be any books left on the shelves anymore. Just becasue something has a bad word or phrase in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken away from peoples enjoyment!	4	4	4
3622	2	If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' @CAPS1 you asked why you were not allowed the same answer was always givin, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again they would most likely have said, '@CAPS2 if I wanted you to know then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it?     Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things. How would it change things if those movies, @CAPS3's, or games had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them?  What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive?     I would also like for you to think about the child you @MONTH1 have or @MONTH1 plan to have, would you want your child to be subjected to such things as '@DATE1 The @NUM1' or '@CAPS9 and @CAPS10' as a @NUM2 year old? Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence? Then they would never see them and to some that @MONTH1 be what's right, and for those of you who think that I have some news for you, those kind of movies are still made today.  '@DATE1 The @NUM1' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that i could throw @CAPS6 you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language. They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies.  There are @CAPS11 movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them.     You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them. But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes.  What would there be left to watch?  If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch, @CAPS12 the @CAPS13 and @CAPS14-@CAPS15? Not only that, but what movies would you watch, if all movies with something offensive in them were removed then you wouldn't have anything left for yourself.  Every thing that you might like and/or think is funny in a film, but don't want your child to see is gone.     My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that @MONTH1 be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see.  Instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them, but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music. It's what I'm sure your parents did you, and I know it's what mine do to me, and guess what?  It has worked so far, so why should we change it?	5	5	5
3629	2	People from all over the world have many different opinions. If someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it. Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it.     One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone @MONTH1 feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read.     Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth. I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not.     In my own opinion, I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny.     Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do.	4	4	4
3641	2	I believe that if you are at a library or movie store, or where ever and there are books,movies, magazines, or cd's that you think are offensive that they should most likley be taken off of the shelf.     Have you ever walked into a store and seen something not approprite for little kids, and you get a little embarassed yourself?I know I have at least one point and time in my life. Which is why I believe that it should be removed from the store, or at least the shelves.     I always try to think of how my grandparents would feel if they new what kind of music most teen's are listening to today. There is so much terrible language and talking about violence and bad things that really just isnt appropriate for anyone to hear, or even talk about.      Some people feel differant about this, and some people take it a little to serious, but you have to remember everyone has their own opinion	2	3	2
3668	2	Libraries are great for multiple reasons. A library is the place to go if you need to do research, meet with a tudor, find an interesting book to read, find that one song you've been looking for, or pick out a new movie to rent for tonight. However within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get. Censorship in libraries is a topic that comes up every now and then, and people will debate over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing to have.      Personally, I think that censorship can just be more unconvienient for some. For example, when I was in the ninth grade I was assigned to do a research paper over @ORGANIZATION1's. However this topic turned out to be a challenge to research because the libraries I went to did not offer many books or resources over @ORGANIZATION1's because it is seen as an 'inapropriate' or 'offensive' topic. Also, the librarians wouldn'@CAPS1 let me check out some of the books because of my age. Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren'@CAPS1 going to let me proceed with my research.      I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access. If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themsleves to avoid it. Rather than just getting rid of it all together.      The same goes for any form of media. If there is a @CAPS1.V. show that you don'@CAPS1 like, don'@CAPS1 watch it. If there is a song that you dislike, then don'@CAPS1 listen to it. It is that easy. I know I do it all the time. People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives. When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is @CAPS2.K. and not @CAPS2.K. for them to see or hear. Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidlines, are set and the child understands what they are.      In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information. Any information. Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer. I think that libraries should'nt have to feel responsible for censoring items that @MONTH1 be offensive. It is their job to just offer information	4	4	4
3670	2	Libraries are plase that you can get a book you shute be          oergat to be lick soem ales you are won porsn you have eve           rhit to got in book you wat.

3671	2	Should books, movies, magazines etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. No, because all you have to do is ignore it or not pay any attention to it and it shouldn't bother you that much. Most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story, that has been on the news for the past week, people think that it is awesome that he is was finally found and killed. If people found that offensive that might be because they don't know what he did or wasn't around when it happened.     If they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read. If someone found a movie that was racist the don't get it, just put it back and find something else like a romance or a comedy. Everybody could use a laugh every once and a while. For music if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good, if not then tell them no and that you find it offensive. If they were a true friend then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else.      Magazines, from what I know don't really have anything offensive in them. The only thing the have a some pictures, gossip, facts, and some stories that might peak your interest. Books might have something things that you find offensive but, if you like the book so much you might as well finish it. If you found a book that you really like then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what is about. Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive they were all good books, books that i would probably read again if I wanted to, but I won't, because I'm lazy.      Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them. Some might pertain to blacks or mexicans, something like that. Well I haven't read any like that yet but, I have heard somethings about it. In the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers. I think that if you find something offensive then just ignore it and move on to something else instead  of throwing a fit about it because that wouldn't do well at all.	3	4	3
3687	2	Books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life. We all know whats wrong, and what's right.     Every school is different. Some schools have limits on their books, such as if you're two years old, and reading something like @PERSON1, then that's gonna be inappropriate. If you're sixteen and reading a @PERSON2 book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit. Every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2. Most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five. Books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading '@CAPS4'. Just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be. Be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it.     Don't we all agree that music is life? Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. Don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music? So why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking. I say who cares? Don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else. I love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned. In my opinion I hate christian songs, I think they're too slow, and constantly talking about @CAPS5, but that doesn't mean I should ruin it for everyone else, just because I hate it. Everyone is different, no one is the same. Music helps me gets through life, and I know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned.     Movies, movies, movies! Video games, video games, video games! We all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us. Movies have ratings like video games do. Ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old. Adults would most likely be playing a rated @CAPS6 game, and watching rated @CAPS7 movies. Little kids about the age of six would be playing rated @CAPS8 games, and watching rated @CAPS9 movies. As you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things. Rated @CAPS7 movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch. It doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned.     In my opinion, I think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. It just should all be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it. We should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves. No one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless I am a youth. Then material should be suppervised by my parents.	4	3	4
3701	2	Censorship. If someone does not like what a book, magazine, movie, etc., shows then they should put it back up and not worry about it. But their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff. Most people who do i personally think are immature.     Censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings, because of nude statues and the way they talked. A lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today. Sometimes their is no way of getting around inapropriate materials. Then their are a lot of people who find those subjects very intersting and like to study it. So by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain. The music that is out today has a lot of inapropriate words and sayings in them that would be offensive to most people. But the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it. Most of the time they aren't listening to the words, but just like the beat of the song. Almost all of the older people hate this music and never wanna hear it and think it should be banned. What they dont realize is that if it was taken out of the library their would be more upset and angry people then happy. Magazines and movies today have a lot of inapropriate advertisements and pictures, but now that is what most people like and want to see.      You cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people. Taking all the materials out of the library would most likely take the number of vistors that come to the library go down, because what they are intersted in would not be their anymore so they would have no reason to go anymore. That is what most likely would happen if the books, magazines, movies music, etc., were found offensive and were taking off the shelves	3	3	3
3717	2	Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want. Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright. I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings.      Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive. well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''.  Am sorry but thats not how life works. If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way. If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves.     Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive. Heres what i say to it, get over it .          The other  day i was at the bait shop and i heared a word that  i dare not to even  say and i hate hearing that word. What was i going to do tell a grown man to not say that?...... I just  rolled my eyes and went on about my  buisness.          Should books, music, ect; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well like ive  been saying this whole time, in live there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you. You have to get over it . Sometimes geting over offensive things that you see are not easy but hey lifes not  easy	3	3	3
3727	2	Do I believe that ceertain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? NO, the reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me,they might not be offensive to other people. Im not saying things like that are offensive to me because there not. I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them. That excites me.     Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don'@CAPS1 need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up. I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn'@CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'. Well thats a gud question. Just put it up and dont complain because the writer didn'@CAPS1 know you were gonig to take it offensive or the wrong way. They were just writing a book.           It's not the writers fault. He or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book. When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive. DON'@CAPS1 because they exspecing there self's. So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad  beacause they took it offensive. Your going to ruin it for the other people that though the book was either a good book or an azsome book.     So now that we got that out of the way lets move on and get on with our life's. Thanks for the conversation. See you next	3	3	3
3769	2	My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain maeterial shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit. For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books.          Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about. Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain top them what the problem is in your case.     Also you could always have a section of the store, or librarie just for adults only. It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actualy help out alot. There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children.      If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children, or other childrens minds. You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see	3	3	3
3784	2	In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.     Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.     The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began.     Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.     Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where	5	5	5
3785	2	I think everything should be there.  The examples of things that should be there are: all magazines, books, and @CAPS1 service.  For the magazines there should be all cars, trucks, atvs, mtvs, utvs, espn, golf, game informers, and wwe magazines.          Now for the books.  All the types of of books that should be allowed are @CAPS2-@CAPS3, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 books.  And last the @CAPS1 service.  The @CAPS1 service sould be used for school work, to play all games on any website, and to use youtube on any computer.     This all should be used there because certin things some kids  don't have at home.	2	2	2
3789	2	They will see it eventually. There is no reason to censor a library, I believe. I think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back  of the libarary is enough censorship. You have to look at it in the publishers view also. They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so. Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled apon something they believe is offensive.          We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @ORGANIZATION1. Things that show innaproperate pictures, drugs, firearms..ect. I believe they are already censored enough. Most of magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or secetioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their childern flipping threw the pages corrupting their minds. Some material are even put in a plastic sleve so the person must puchase it before reading.          If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. That's not fair in @LOCATION1. I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials. offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it	3	3	3
3838	2	All of us can think of or have this one book that we read and  hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf.Well at least I know I have a book like that, its called '@CAPS1'. I, myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the selves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and sex.      A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called,'@CAPS1'. I was a good book but it was also very explesive. The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in a abusive relationship, peer pressure, and a adiction to sex and drug.      This book was exposing and very detailed, In which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book.  I feel sex and violence shouldn't displayed in books or any other type of media.      Inconclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive. Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the selves of libary unless their issued to someone eighteen or older	3	3	3
3845	2	I think that if it is a problem for others and not all why can't we just seperate the things in sections. That way there would be no problems.    I mean, why change something if only a few people doesn't like something? Thats only goning to lead to a big conflict. Think about if we were to tr and give everyone what they want, @CAPS1 would that work out not good at all. So you should just limiy thing dow and put them in setions.	2	2	2
3873	2	Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for.	5	6	5
3887	2	Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are used for peoples enjoyment. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries reading materials. Books give  people another way to learn new things, instead of in a class.       If the reading materials are already in the classroom they should not be removed. If someone is walking into a library, they have to be responsible. Adults along with young adults have to know what they should read and whats not acceptable.      No one has the right to take a book off of the shelf, because they think its offensive. There are millions of book in the world that people find offensive. Theres not one perfect book in this world that doesn't bother somebody.     Every single book that is made today has a right to be read. Theres people out in the world looking for a certain book, magazine, movie, and even music. That material is hepling find the answer to a problem, giving the right decision, and helping someone walk in the right path.      The @CAPS1 is a book of understanding and knowledge. There are a good number of people how think we shouldn't read it, or even pick it up. Like the @CAPS1 say, free will. It's our free will to pick up books we want to read.     Books give people another way to learn new things. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libaries reading materials. Books, music, movies, and magazines are used for people's enjoyment	4	3	4
3888	2	Should offenive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc. takes away from our freedom as an american citizen.  If you think books should be censored, then think about this.  Would they take 'hell' or 'damned' out of the bible because those words are considered offensive?  I do not think so, those words give power to the book.  @CAPS1 books, considered offensive, are an insigh to history and culture.  Taking away these books will limit education.  Books should not be censored.         I very resent and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1.'  The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man.  In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently.  A lot of people were offended by the using of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave.'  @CAPS1 people were happy with the word change, but others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story.  I agree with the latter statement.  The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known as niggers.  I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotaion, but that is the purpose of using the word.  The author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then.  When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man. The word itself is a symbolism of slavery, without it, the book is not as powerful.       Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line. The story of @ORGANIZATION1 is just one example of censorship.  On television, nudity and language is censored when dubbed inappropriate.  It should be up to the parent to decide which books there child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch.  If the parent sees the book as offensive or think that there child should not read it, then they should be the ones who makes sure their child does not read it.  The books should not be taken of the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents.  Books should not be censored, if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it.	5	4	5
3893	2	Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we?      Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.      It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permenantly be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics.For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of @CAPS1 cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine?      On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessable to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well.      The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even @CAPS2's have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.	4	4	4
3894	2	You are not elgible to check out this book', says the libranian. You are just too young for this book.      To me censorship laws in libraries are not needed. The common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please. The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read.     Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship. Everyonee takes things in differently, being said some are mature than others. If they want to play that game, or read that book they should be allowed. The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material. Therefore they are held accountable for their actions. Isnt that how legal laws are carried out?     If any sort of content is found offensive it still shouldnt be removed from the shelves. Something @MONTH1 seem offensive to one person but someone else @MONTH1 find that interesting. For example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete they @MONTH1 say things tha offends his?her fans. They people who are not fans of him/her @MONTH1 find it ammusing; so they should remove the post because some people dont like it. Someone @MONTH1 like that book, music, movie, or magazine dont inconvience them because of a few people.           Interest @MONTH1 vary, but a teen @MONTH1 like the same type of books as an adult. Censorship laws wont  let the teen read the book they likes because of his/her age, and to me that is unfair. It is a new day and age; things have changed from what they once were. Cencorship laws should be wiped out completly. If you @MONTH1 find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form just dont read it. Nobody is forcing to read that specific book; libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books. There is a book out there that you will enjoy.     In conclusion, certain material shouldnt be removed from shelves if found offensive. Some other peoople @MONTH1 like that same aterial. There shouldnt be censorship laws in libraries at all. That is just unfair, and unjust to some people. Its a new time and age and things are different. People of any age should be able to check out any book they please	3	4	3
3896	2	What is censorship? Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of.  Censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing.  Does censorship really help in our society?  Actually think about it, there is still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censory.  How I would argue with this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings.     Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows.  In some movies you get to choose on what you want to watch. The unrated version or the censored version.  Well, most people want to watch the unrated version, beacuse it's more than likely more funny and shows more.  Other people might choose the censored version, because of the fact that they have children and dont want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version.  I would perferably pick the unrated version, because i like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version.  Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out alot of words, because of course you are not allowed to say them on television.  Parents dont want their six year old going around and saying all of them nasty words.  That's why most of the time you hardly ever see them kind of shows on in the afternoons, they are usually on at @TIME1 or later.     Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows.  I cant say that I dont watch shows that have some language in them nor can I say that I dont watch shows that are all bloody and gory.  I do watch them, but i would never watch them around my younger sister!  She is eleven years old, I dont want my littel sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her.  Then she would say well @PERSON1 was the one who watched the movie.  I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either.  Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money some how. Right?     Last but not least, my readings about, lets say books and/or music lyrics.  So many books have been banned across the @LOCATION1, because people were offended by them or just didnt want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it.  Some songs cant be played on the radio, because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and through out the song.  That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular.  I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also my grade level and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were.  When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and dont let it bother me.  Same with songs, the artist probably has a reason why he/she uses the words they use.     Censorship can be good or bad, it really depends on how you look at things.  Honestly, I have no objections to censorship and other times I do.  My experiences, observations, and/or reading has made me think about how censorship could be bad or good.	4	4	4
3899	2	Walking in to the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you run into some of those disgusting books that are offensive to some people. Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them. Are you?     There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head. Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people. If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book. Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended.      There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there. Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that @MONTH1 offend someone. It would be very helpful to so many people!      In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inapropriate and those books can be removed. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read. Let's put a stop to it.     In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading!	4	4	4
3908	2	'@CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or No?'     Katherine Paterson's quote about offensive books is completely true, and I @PERCENT1 agree with her. She's saying that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books for people in the world. There are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not. What would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf? I do not think that offensive materials such as books should be removed from shelves because not everybody could find them offensive and could be depriving people of their favorite subjects, I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book, and because there would not be books left in the world.     There are books about every single subject in the world. Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days. Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us. Though whatever the subject is, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects. If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived from it because one person found it offensive. Just because on person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too.      I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my @CAPS3 class, we were assigned to read 'The @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5'. As we were reading the book I honestly thought it was a very interesting story. Though later with some research I found out that the book was banned in alot of schools all over the @LOCATION1. Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book. I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a reason to ban the book from schools. It's an awesome story that won a couple awards, and my class also enjoyed it. My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned.     Just as @PERSON1 stated, if every person was given a right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be books left in the world for people to read. There are millions of people in the world. If every single person was able to ban one book in the @LOCATION1, what would we have left? There would probably be nothing left. If every book was gone from the @LOCATION1, what would kids in school be able to read? Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing grades to drop. One little law change in @CAPS1 could cause great negative changes in the future.     There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive. That's never going to change, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor. Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, your depriving other people of books. So I say every library stays the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults.	5	4	5
3914	2	I don't think they should remove anything thats offensive from the library cause honestly, most of the books author publish have something offensive in @CAPS1. I'ts not the library's fault, if there's children reading these books that are offensive then that's the parents fault for letting them read them. I've been to the library and listened to music, watched movies, and even read magazines that have some offensive content in @CAPS1, but if they weer to remove all the offensive content from the library, then the library would be half empty.          I've seen parents discussing to the librarians about banning content thats not appropriate from the library, but why would @CAPS1 even matter if they can just ignore @CAPS1 and keep @CAPS1 away. @CAPS1 honestly isn't a big deal when @CAPS1 comes to these type of problems. I discussed this with my mom once and she completely agree's  with me. My mom said ' @CAPS1 would'nt be a problem as of today if they could of just ignored @CAPS1'. Also the music that they have should stay their wether or not its offensive cause people like to express themselves with the music that they listen to. The movies that are made these days all have innapropriate content in @CAPS1, wether its a rated @CAPS2 movie or not.          As of all the argument going on about library's having offensive content, @CAPS1 should still be kept at the library and not removed. I'm sure alot of teens and adults enjoy all the content that's kept at the library. If children end up listening to the offensive music, or watching offensive movies then think about @CAPS1 like this, they need to grow up someday. If that's not the case then parents should keep them away from the content	3	3	3
3917	2	You go to a library to read books, music, and magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books. I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the books, magazines, and music from shelfs if they are offensive to people. We are suppost to feel safe reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines. When I was younger I went to the library all the time. I would get books to read and look at, and for a while I was excited to go to the library, but all the excitment went away after a few bad exsperiecnes. Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me, but I know I was so upset by how the book was. It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused. This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book, but really librarys should only have good books not bad.After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something. Bad books, offensive books, should be taken off shelfs for good and never to return. I feel very strongly about this subject, because I am a book warm, I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book thats not offinsive is all that I ask for in a library. Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be aloud to be in librarys at all. When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them, but if there are offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that. There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books, music, and magazines.In closing to my essay I still have full curage in my answer, I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines. If it was your sister, your daughter, or your neciece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say? I ask you this, how would you feel?	3	3	3
3922	2	Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them. Should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them?      When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Librarys don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area.      Librarys usually don't carry offensive music. They have @CAPS1's for books to listen to. That might have offensive lauguage in it.  Before renting or buying the @CAPS1 you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the @CAPS1. Most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways.      If movies are offensice they are marked rated @CAPS4. @NUM1 movies are the better ones. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated @CAPS4 movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated @CAPS4 movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see.     Most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women. They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. But if your letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading.      I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, ect., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section. Some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive. Everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library	3	4	3
3925	2	What is @LOCATION1's main idea in the area of art, language, and music? The idea of @LOCATION1 in those catagories is freedom. Freedom is to write what we want, draw what we want, and say what we want, and in all, to express ourselves freely as a person. It is one of the amendments in the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', known as freedom of speech.     Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the @CAPS3 public. It is their right as an @CAPS3 to buy what they want. It takes away @CAPS2 from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers. They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see.     Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody. Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it. That's what gives the world its varieties. What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal. When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal? Just to make the other person feel better?     I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame. I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier. He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game. I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game. The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here. Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me. What difference did it make? In the end I got the game anyway.      That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down. It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something. It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive.      We need to let people express how they feel. If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different. @PERSON1 had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it. Everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking. But he did it, and proved himself right.      Galilaue @CAPS5 thought came up with the theory that the sun did not revolve around the @LOCATION2. He started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory. The people of where he did his work got engraged and through him into exile and imprisoned him. After that somebody thought that it was a good idea, he experimented on it, and the people supported him. Now we have that theory as a fact, that the sun doesn't revolve around the @LOCATION2.      That is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world. It makes people think in different ways. It helps people think of new ideas. Freedom is the key to any way of living.	5	4	5
3929	2	What do you think about Books? Do you think it matters how appropriate they are? Well im going to tell you my oppinion on the books that should and shouldn't be in libraries.      I think that there are many different few from many different people on books. Someone just cant say that they think a book shouldn't be in a library period. I think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library. I can see that some parents @MONTH1 not want to have their kid reading it but i think that they are going to hear a lot worse and see worse than a book is going to have.      I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they dont want there child reading that kind of book. I belive that if a kid wants to read it than they are going to read it, parents shouldn't be so up tight on what there kids read. I know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it. Also a grade school shouldn't even have a book that would be considered inappropriate to a student in there library, or should have a parent sign somethign saying that they are ok with it.     So inconclusion thats what I say if parents have a problem with it than they should discuss it with the school. They should just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they dont want their child to check out such books. All a parent would have to do is go in to the school or where ever their child is getting the book and tell them that and it would solve all problems	3	3	3
3931	2	My opinions on the censorship in libraries are that libraries are great places to get information on books such as biographies, fiction, nonfiction, science fiction, and other genre books. I don't believe that books, music, movies, magnizines and other things should not be removed off the shelves because people love music and they want to get information about the artist who made the songs and information about the artist. Also people want to learn the lyrics to the song.     The reason why books shouldn't be removed off the shelves is becuase people enjoy reading books and they want to know what the book is about and have some information about the book. Books are very important to people and need some entertainment other than television. Also people used books to study for the book is going to be read and then going to be tested on. The books that are found offensive should be removed because people get very upset if they find out that the book is talking bad about them. Unless some people are not mature at all and can't read books that are not even talking about them.     Movies shouldn't be removed off of shelves because people love watching movies and they are very entertaining to them. If a movie is very offensive to the people, yes it is probably best to remove the movie because they don't want to watch it anymore. But other movies are not even bad. Yes some movies have foul language but people still enjoy it. But sometimes in movies people hear something from the movie and they spread it around the @LOCATION1. Then everybody starts saying the foul language. People just have to learn how to not use foul language when not needed.     Magazines shouldn't be removed because people love reading magazines especially sports related. I know I love reading sports magazines because I am a very true sports fan and sports are very important to me other than school. There are very inappropiate magazines that children shouldn't be reading and they should be removed off of shelves. Magazines are also used for different things such as comics, housework, as for ladies makeup, perfume, etc. People think that magazines are very important to the society	4	4	4
3938	2	I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put I lock on the door and if you have proof of @CAPS1 that shows your @NUM1 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of @CAPS1 then I guess your not going back to the adult section.     I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your @NUM1, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be @NUM1 or older to go back there and look. I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with.     People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inaproperiate things to nice people.       When kids do that then othere parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies.      Im going to close this little description now and im still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen	3	3	3
3939	2	There are many inapropriate types of intertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate.     With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to. Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive. Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a persons life.     With censoring there would be no diverstiy. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small.     I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society.     I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys. It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society	4	3	4
3944	2	Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these procautions?     In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch @CAPS1.V. or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, @CAPS2, and videogames.     I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for.     When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it.     Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don'@CAPS1 care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library.	4	4	4
3971	2	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer.     Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business.     From what i've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already. Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them.	3	3	3
3992	2	Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect. All of these  are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be cencered? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be cencored.          My first supporting reason of why books and music should be cencored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncencored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer preasure.     The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music affends people by their race, religion, or their apperance. You find most of the critizisium from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisment about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended.     My final reasoning for books and music being cencored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad. If songs and books were cencored there wouldn't be a sterio type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material.      Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are cencored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be cencored.	4	3	4
4010	2	The library is an important place for the knowledge seeker.  The library holds books of past and current writers.  It also holds information on past and current events.  Censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offenseive history, books, or newspaper articles.     Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history.  One reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information.  Periods like the holocaust, the genocide of about six million @CAPS1 by @LOCATION2, would eventually die with the generations that knew about it.  The holocaust was an event that became known @CAPS2 wide during @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which was a major historical event.   The slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship.  The slave trade is a major part in @CAPS5 history that helped shape the country it is today.  Another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance.  If we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history.  Keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn.  Censorship in libraries aimed toward historical events should not be allowed.     Also, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.  One reason is beacuse authors wrote their books how they intended them to be read.  An example is @PERSON2.  The author of The @CAPS6 of @PERSON3 and The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION2.  Both books use the word @NUM1r to convey the tone.  Another examample is the author of To @CAPS7 A @CAPS8, @PERSON1.  Another reason to ban censorship in books is because that's an authors writing style.  The author writes a book how they want it to be read.  Therefore they use the language and words of the time period they write about.  @PERSON2 didn't use @NUM1r because he was racist, he used it to convey what times were like and how people talked.  Censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.     Finally, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to get rid of newspaper articles.  One reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information.  It brought peoples attention to recent happenings.  It informed people of what was going on.  Getting rid of that is just another loss of information.  Newpapers were key players in getting out information about @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the assasination of @CAPS12 and @ORGANIZATION1.  Another reason to keep from censoring newpapers in libraries is because of their importance today.  They continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events.  An example is the death of @LOCATION1 and how he caused the deaths of many @CAPS13 on @DATE1 eleventh.  Articles about views on the death penalty.  Censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries to get rid of offensive newspaper articles.     The library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker.  There, they can read about past and current events.  They can also read classics by great authors.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles.	4	4	4
4018	2	Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries. Whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1, someone is going to be offended. But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike. I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press.         You could take any famous work and someone could be offended @CAPS5 it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned! Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we have total freedom of the press. You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in @PERSON1's @CAPS4 @NUM2, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age.      To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage. @PERSON2 @LOCATION1 that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' @CAPS5 saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended @CAPS5 every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances.      The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going @CAPS5 making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. @CAPS5 allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers. In this case, @CAPS5 keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history	4	4	4
4021	2	If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, should they be able to get it removed? In the following I want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries.     If some parents see a book they are offended by, and they don't think their children should be able to get it from the library, they could just forbid them to read it. I don't think they should be able to remove it, even though they might think other children shouldn't be able to get it either, but that's not their decision. Every parent has to decide on their own, if they want their children to get certain books, but one parent shouldn't be able to decide for everyone else by removing a book.     Some people might be offended by certain books in libraries, but just because one person is offended by a book, doesn't mean that everyone else is going to be offended by it. Does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed? It is their personal opinion that they don't like it, but by removing it they would also keep other people from reading it, and that is not fair. Different people like different books, and are offended by different books, so if everyone would remove a book they don't like from the library, there wouldn't be any books left. I think if someone is offended by a book, they just shouldn't read it. They could tell their friends and family not to read it, because they thought it was offensive, but in the end everyone should decide for themselves.     I don't think people should be able to remove books from the libraries, but if the library itself thinks a book is offensive, then they shouldn't have it. It is their library, so it's their decision what books they want to have there. i also think that when the library doesn't have certain books, because they really pay attention to the books they take in their library, that that should be good enough for other people.     So all in all I don't think people should be able able to remove certain books, because everyone has their own opinion towards what is offensive, and what isn't. We all should be able to read or see, what we want to, and not what others think we should.	4	4	4
4026	2	Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor	5	5	5
4051	2	Libraries.     What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers.	3	4	3
4053	2	Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read. Most books and movies are filled with sex,gang violence, and drugs. In my generation sex, durgs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere. Books are suppose to be about learning. Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.         Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of  offensive behavor. You should be able to open a magazine and   learn somthing brand new.    Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics. Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with  the topic you dont want. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence.     If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved  with what you read. Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's. Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children.     Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit. there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library.	4	3	4
4058	2	To who it @MONTH1 concern:     @CAPS1 you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of liturature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries.     In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe.      Liturature can be described as art that an individual portrays it as in his/her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day. This means it has been there wars, politics, art and slavery. All of these are a part of liturature, so liturature is history in it's own way.     Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries. they might think that it should be removed from everywhere. It should not. It is a part of history. @CAPS1 you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at that certain time. It tells us what was happening in that part of the world. It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right. Many people thought is was right. They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs in return that they respect our's.     Liturature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldnt be where we were today. Liturature should stay in the shelves of libraries where they belong. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. @CAPS1 you want to be know for destroying an important part of history	4	4	4
4059	2	Many people have different views and opinions on things. No opinion or view is right or wrong. Books, music, and movies of controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make the desicion for everyone.     Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't make others see things their way. If someone was at a library, and thought the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series were offensive, they might be the only ones to think that. They can't tell the library to remove them because they're uncomfortable with the books. Things go by majorty rule, and that person is not the majorty. They're the only one with the problem.     Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal. If someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can't tell the store to remove it. One person can't change everything to fit their needs. They would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed. To make everyone happy, the person could just not listen it. There's a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable.     One person cannot make the desicions for everyone. The president doesn't even make the desicions by himself; he has the government helping him. If one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don't have the right to change it. They're not the one in charge so they can't be the one to change the magazine. It might be inapprpriate, but other people enjoy reading it.      I believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't make everyone see it their way. Books, music, movies, and magazines are few of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject inside the material. Some of the stuff is inappropriate or offensive, but one person can't change it. Not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they want, and one person can't make desicions for everyone	4	4	4
4074	2	Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive.  Books, movies, and music were created for a reason.  It's a form of entertainment as well as to build knowledge.  Artists, authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.     Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive.  Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society.  If all books on the @CAPS1 were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincated.  The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons.     Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valubale or interesting information.  People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing.  The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our decision to make.  It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves.  If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benifit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material.  Banning things from the public takes away opprotunity for people to engage in things that interest them.     Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a thought.  The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' had multiple occurances of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone.  It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening.  Small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it.     Katherine Paterson's quote is correct, if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us.  Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material.  There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone.     Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason.  Not only is it for entertainment,  but it is also for knowledge too.  Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.	4	4	4
4076	2	I don't think that censoring books and movies is needed in my opinion. Very many people are just too protective. They just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts. Eventually everybody will come in contact with almost everything that is mentioned in books at some point in there life. Life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment. You will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older.      The people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get there way at least in their community. I think that libraries should be organized in a way that when you walk in you know the section you want to be in. They should have the books for adults in one section, books for teenagers in a different section, and books for kids in another section of the library too. This would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot. This would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is.      Another good thing that would help in a library are signs that catergorize the books. So if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book. You just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are. This would help majorly for people that have never been in a library or don't know how to search for their book in a library.      The next thing would be to have all the movies, magazines, and music in the categories of adult, kids, and teenagers too. They would be in the sections of the books but at the same time be seperated to where the signs in the section say movie and music. This way kids don't have to roam around to find a certain movie that they want and have to roam around in the adult section to find it. The movies and magazines don't have to be exactly in the categories of mystery and things like that because normally movies are more well known than books in our time period.     A good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention. If a little kid goes into a section that is dull and boring they @MONTH1 just wander in the adult section and stumble across something that their parents don't want them to. The kids section could be lots of colors, the teenager section could be maybe one color, and the adult section could be the most dull of all of the colors.     All of my ideas would work and keep all of the kids entertained. They also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking in a library. These are the only ideas that I have that would work well. There could be more things that would keep kids interested but only for a little bit	3	4	3
4080	2	Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @MONTH1 find to be offensive @MONTH1 not be ofensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of      @CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material @MONTH1 be to them	4	3	4
4086	2	Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads. Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc. That is the parents reponsibility, it's the library's.      The library is a place to go when you want to get a book or a movie or a magazine, ect. Whether it's for enjoyment or research. That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read. If we took out all the material in the library that some people, in there oppion, found offensive, then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library. Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow? If an adult or mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book? Or even teach them that those books are wrong.      The parents have full responsibiliy if their child is reading something that is inapropriate in their eyes. How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong. If the kid is young, the parent would be the one taking their child to the library, so they could easily watch which book, magazine, or movie they're picking out. Most libraries have a children's section anyway.     It is not the library's responisbility to watch out for your child, it's the parents. Their job is to supply the community with books, movies, magazines, etc. Libraries should keep the books on the shelvles so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read.	3	3	3
4087	2	Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive. People argue to get the corruptive  books, magazines, movies off the shelves. The customers have the choice not to check out the material, it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf.          People that go to the library have the choice to read the book or not, if they have heard bad reviews about the book then they can just ignore it. The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason, and its not to be taken off just because some people dont care for it. Reasons might be that the book goes against beliefs of religion, or just the way those people view things, but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf.          Everybody has different likeings and tastes when it comes to books. Because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's. Beliefs and standards differ from person to person and that is why the likeing of books is different to most everybody.          Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive. If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you dont want them reading then tell them that the book is innapropriate. The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back, that is a much better technique than trying to get the book removed.          Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library. Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read. When looking for a book, magazine, movie, etc., and you run across one you find innapropriate then ignore it and continue with your day, it's as simple as that	4	4	4
4089	2	I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive.                                                                                                     People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4.     @CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses.     Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive.     Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be.     Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs.     I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books.     I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not. In the end, @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion	4	4	4
4099	2	Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.       Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.      Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example. The movie industry might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries.      Music artist might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.      Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work	4	4	4
4119	2	I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves. Just because some one @MONTH1 finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are.     I feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to. No one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read. Every one has the choice. To choose what they want to read or watch.      what one person @MONTH1 find offensive and wrang. Another person. @MONTH1 find interesting and exiting. I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf. The next person after me. Has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have. To like or hate what ever is on the shelves.     There are lots of things in a @CAPS5. Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive. There are scary books like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON2. There are mistury books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON1.     So to some up my esay. Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves. Just because i or any one else finds them offensive	3	3	3
4127	2	Do you think that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive to people? This is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another. For some, it just depends on your age, your beliefs, and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place. In my opinion, I think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves.      First of all, I think a lot of it depends on your age. For, example, most older people think that most of the material made today is just crazy and do not want anyhting to do with them. Although, for the younger people, thet is what is new and 'cool' to do. I do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids. We want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it. In my own experience, my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part. I think it has affected me a lot today on who I am today.      Next, I think for some people, it depends on their beleifs. A big thing with this is race and culture. I often find books, movies, or magazines offending another race. This the the thing that I find most disturbing about some materials. Anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion. There are countless numbers of these materials just theat I have seen and I am sure that there are many more. It @MONTH1 be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves.      Lastly, I think that a lot of people do not know that what they are going to read, watch, or listen to, is going to end up being offensive. I have seen a countless number of movies and listen to a countless number of songs that were offensive. The sad thing is, I did not know it before I did it. A lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat, as far as knowing if it is offensive goes. I think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves, then it should at least be marked as offensive.      All in all, I think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves. We have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do. Even though there are factors like age, beliefs, and knowing what you are going into, I think these materials are just bad for everyone. In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves	4	4	4
4132	2	Shut down libraries?     Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnessisarry attire, they could also contain potty mouth language.  The words could, and can, corupt the minds of youngsters.  All librairies put them there because of the needs of customers.  The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me?     They should create seperate libraries for each type of reader.  Still, they put all of these things in the same building.  They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'.  I think I'll write my own @CAPS1 sieries, thank you very much.     However, because some have dull enviornments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down.  Make use of that thought I just told you.  I wonder if some books on endangered species of fish.  But some kid's sieries are dieing of because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories.     If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life.  What chic-cursing out loud in front of the baby.  How about saying '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 that?..' or '@CAPS4 that ball, you meanie!'?  Maybe THAT will give some education.     However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language.  Those dilenguents don't care about their minds at all.  Your honor, I have my proof right here.  I suggest reeducating those teenage dilenguents to acting more @CAPS1.	3	3	3
4137	2	In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information. All of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take. Byt what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world? What if some of this information changed the persective of peoples' lives, and who people are? Libraries do contain offensive and provokative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful to the behavior standpoint of all human beings. Censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the @LOCATION1 come from many different places making the @LOCATION1 very diverse. One thing in a book @MONTH1 not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else. Magazines, movies, books, etc. should be examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain @CAPS1 whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgable assistance to help what people are looking for.     Sections in libraries organizes the library providing and easier access to where things are located. In libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location. The benefit of having sections divided depending on people's @CAPS1 is that it seperates the mature section from the immature section appose to having both in one. Children normally have a seperate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from. An example of a bad situation would be if their was a book located in the childrens section that spoke about drugs and alcohol. The children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are. They could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life-taking. This is common sense. Sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well.     Personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that their are books in libraries that could be about offensive material. Asssistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it. Because there is an interminable amount of information, I believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about. Everytime I visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when I ask for assistance, they help me find what I am looking for. They warn me about offensive or provokative imagery and such and help me with upmost respect. Assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc. Assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc.      Personally, I believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries. Writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover. Censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provokative. Everyone in the @LOCATION1 has the right to read whatevery they please. Some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something. There is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out out of peoples' mouthes are useful no matter how rediculous it is. Even if it is the most rediculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come. This would be more on opinion based writing. In factual righting, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document. This document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive. Offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true.This brings me to my persepective on the matter that I think there should be a sense of censorship within reason although everyone has the right to read whatever they please because there is a never ending amount of information in the world and that information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books	4	4	4
4142	2	Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.     I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.     I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape.     Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.     So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. Like i said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?	4	4	4
4153	2	I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff. Someone might have wanted to get that book. I don't think it would be right to take it away.      When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated. They would not let me listen to the music I liked. They thought it was bad for kids to listen to. All they wanted me to listen to was christian music and I did not like that.      My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me. They would make me read the bible everynight. They tried to shove religion down my throat. I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious. They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her.      Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch. When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do. If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves. They would not be able to show off what they really like. They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right. Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like.	3	3	3
4166	2	People will always take things offensive.  It is a fact of life.  No one will ever be completly satisified no matter what.  We can not try to please everyone, but it will never happen.  We have a freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others.  Things on the internet are offensive and no one can mandate how it is veiwed either.  The same should go for a library.     I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate.  Some of the things authors write can be either innapproraite or offensive.  That is their freedom of speech.  We can not take that away from them but there should be some censorship at least to the apprearance of books.  For music and movies they usually have a warning lable if it is not intended for younger kids.  It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines.      In order to see a rated, '@CAPS1', movie you have to be over @NUM1 and for a good reason because of the mature content.  The books being writen now are more and more mature.  But if we take on the custom of being of certain age for books we might invaid the privacy of others.     No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive.  Who can judge whether something is offensive? The libraries are publicly owened and therefore have no one owner.  The city owns them.  If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library it is the city's decision.  Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unnanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves.  The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request.      Taking books off the shelves I beleive is taking away from the public's ability to read.  If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian.  The librarian @MONTH1 be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and apealing to their child.	3	4	3
4173	2	Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them? Well I can, Children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days. Banned books could be the way we set them stait and make them recognise that stuff is bad.      Only a handfull of kids these days are choosing to read books, a majority of them are playing video games and watching tv. Chilren shouldn't be alloud to swear, or think that violence is alright. Chilren will read these bad books and think it is ok to shoot someone if they are doing something they don't like, but it's not alright. Banned books are exaclty what children need when they are in their younger years.     Banned books might have foul language and violence, but I believe that it is ok to let your teen or young adault read them if they are mature enough to handle it. Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it, or someone killing another person. Some banned books don't even have swear words in them; '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' doesn't have one swear word in any of the books but still it remains on the banned books list to this day.      Some books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed for profanity and drugs. I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list. Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing.      In conclusion I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderatly. The children today dont need to be learning about sex, drugs, swearing, violence, etc. I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about.	3	4	3
4185	2	We live in a world @DATE1 inundated and persuaded by media.  Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present.  Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media.     The art world is considered to be one of the most controversal businesses to work in.  Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics.  We all are given the right to our opinion on such  pieces.  Every piece of art is judged and then criticized.  However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form.  It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction.  For an example, religious pieces are often scorned for their nonfactual information or for the director's or author's opinion over the matter.  Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience.  Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience.  Why not learn from them and reflect?     No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world.  As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized.  The men and women who fought for our country @MONTH1 enjoy to see such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peace keepers @MONTH1 see this as an insult to their cause.       @PERSON1 wrote a book by the name @CAPS1 @NUM1.  This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship.  The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions.  If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books.  History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending.  Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the @CAPS2 and other works of religion.  Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent.      @PERSON1 denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson.  For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity.  Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor.  Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together.  We can not escape the diversity in which we live in.  The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen through our earphones all make up our generations history and the next.  We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal.  If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history.  We have to accept others ideas and build on them to improve our life and other's.  As we stand @DATE1 in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect.  It is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on	4	4	4
4187	2	CENSORSHIP @CAPS1: @CAPS2 paper     Do I believe the certain materials, such a book,music,movies,magazines,ect., should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.my opinion is the if some one wants to write a magazines or a book is okay because the are giveing there opinion know some people just have to say what they believe and some to fight for what they want not just censorship has there fight every one has one.     Some materials like music,movies and magazines need to be censor because the kids how go to the libraries kids who are like @NUM1 @NUM2 grade or maybe smaller then that. We need to clean the libraries from thigs the kids are not old enough to see or to hear.Libraries are a place to study and to read a good book or maybe a magazine we have to censor the bad languge and the bad pictures. This can be very offensive for some parents beacuse the @MONTH1 talk about the color of another person or a bad language to offen the goverment.      People don't have the actittud to stop with this bad songs how contain censorship see somepeople who write this they say the peolpe don't have the actittud to be or say what they want, i think the we need people like that to  just point fingers and say thats the bad guy but enswer this what good have you done to clean the libraies.      Censorship is just a small fight about removeding bad contains from the shelves this is just a call make your city a good place to live help the libraries help today change you future tomorrow make a differens	3	3	3
4208	2	One @MONTH1 subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion.  I personally disagree with the concept.  The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences.  Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion.       Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons.  First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and priviledges upheld in the face of the law.  Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public.  The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted.       Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries.  The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar.  We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that.       Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society.  I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship.  '@CAPS5 @NUM1,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens.  '@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though I have not read the composition myself.  '@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar.  All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization.       In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method.  In any case, a more effective solution must exist today.  To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place.       Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity.  The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces.  Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings.  Different regions utilize different systems, but that of  the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe.       As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all.  Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor.  Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years.  Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset.  It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose	5	5	5
4209	2	The ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are an art.  They cannot be explained in any other way than themselves, and if we take away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses something of itself.     Censorship is the underlying problem to many things.  It takes away the expression of human thought and emotion- emotions like greed, love, fear, and the ability to empathize that are conveyed in books and films.  If people think it's offensive, they simply can't take the truth.       Many people can only express themselves in their art- and art can be very real.  So real that we don't think that it's possible.  We don't want to believe something like 'The @CAPS1' could happen.  'The @CAPS1' is a short story in which kids get together and rob an old man's home.  Because this man is very rich, he has lots of material wealth.  Then they burn down the house with the man's belongings still in it.  Needless to say, this story has been banned from many schools and libraries.  But what many don't understand is why would the kids burn down the house.  Many think that the kids just want to see it burn, to destroy what is so cherished, or that the love of material things is making us greedy.  It is this that makes us think, and therein lies the problems with censorship.  If we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here, then we begin to lose ourselves.     The loss of books has been seen throughout history.  Most prominantly, the nazi regime.  In the beginning of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against the nazi ideals.  The censorship escalated into the nazis burning books in large piles. This communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset.  The movement swelled and the  @CAPS3 people soon developed a national pride and goal.  By the @DATE1's, nearly every @CAPS3 who could read had read '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'.  The censorship had turned into an all-out war on classical literature and the promotion of nazi ideas.  That was how @CAPS7 was actually voted in.  Many don't realize, but the @CAPS8 actually did vote @CAPS7 to be leader.  Now that the nazis had destroyed the publics ideals, they were replaced with the nazi's own.     The banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge.  The human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates.  If we try to explain it, we soon get lost in our words.  The use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are.  Censorship has never ended in something good- only the promotion of something bad.  If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own.	4	4	4
4231	2	The book called @CAPS1. the book is about a young @CAPS2-@CAPS3 man that starts school at @ORGANIZATION1. While the first few weeks in school he is picked on and made fun of. So one day he has join a boxing class, and the wreslting team at his school. But at the end of the book he ends up fighting everybody the was bullin him.      I personaly the book should be kept on the self because its a life changing expersance for a young man. For some people this book they will or have even read this book several times, I know I have. I only hope that othere people will like or even love this book as much as I have.          So I guess what I am trying to say is you really never know what you are going to like in till us sit there and read it from beganing to the end	2	2	2
4241	2	Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries?     Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people @MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself.           People of different races and cultures @MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout. Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue @MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.      Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries. What will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.      Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us	4	4	4
4246	2	Every parent wants to protect their child's innocence. They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions. The truth is though that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the @CAPS1. It is their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material.     One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It is all about choices. There are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people @MONTH1 want to read or watch something with such content. Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them. People should have the option to read or watch what they wish. Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to such topics.     Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 is a very true statement. After one censoring, people might still think topics are inappropiate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left. People eventually will not be able to use libraries. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource.      A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person might not be to another. How would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided? It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not. Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it. It is as simple as that.      There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are obvious. Censoring libraries are going to eliminate a person's choice. It will cause problems, as to what is appropiate and what is not. Eventually libraries will have nothing left. Of course every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices. Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things. All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong.	4	4	4
4253	2	the author ketherine paterson is like letting you know like life is going to dont be behain go forword and grab the book from the shelf fot you and for your children because most of the book are gone because other people got them. i would go to the library and grab the book from the shelf for me and my kids. mom can grad some good books for the kids like a book that have the parts of the body grammer so they can start learning something rite no that they are lilttle and they will ganna star to make sentences.in @DATE1 in warsaw school the principal decide to remove everything from the library because people didnt go and check out books,music,movies,megazines, etc he decide to remove them because people didnt check out nathing and most of the people put everything in obserbation but my question is why people didnt check out something for their kids so they can start to read to learn something from their moms school. in my  opinion if i would the principal of the school i wouldnt take of the books nathing about the library i would live everything so they can grab the books from the shelf and check them out so the kids start to lear how to read they ganna learn something special from their mom.	1	1	1
4261	2	I believe that censorship within libraries and any other public media source is wrong, immoral, and unfair. Authors, artists, phtographers, etc. have the right to freedom of speech. Why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to? The censorship of any media should not be allowed in public consumer spots, not only because it goes against basic american rights, but it also takes the responsibility, originality, and expression out of @CAPS1' lives.      If a parent or gaurdian did not wish for their child to be exposed to certain genres of certain media, isn't it their responsibility to intercept that from their childs environment? If a parent really abhors a certain genre, then it is up to that parent to create a surrounding in which they feel that their child is safe. It is understandable that some genres of music, magazines, books and movie contain material that @MONTH1 be too graphic or mature for reader of a certain age, but situations like this in today's world is unavoidable. In my experience, I know that when I was to young to understand the happenings of @NUM1, my parents intercepted the stories from me. My parents turned off graphic or violent television when I walked in the room. They felt that this sort of material was inappropriate for someone at age @NUM2, so they exerpted that material from my environment. When you become a parent, you take on responsibility for the life of another person. This responsibility includes the childs health, safety, and his/her surroundings. Why can't @LOCATION1 leave the parenting of children to the parents?     When children turn into teenagers and teengers become adults, they earn many privelages. They earn the right to drive, then the right to vote, then the right to drink responsibly. There is a maturity level that goes into making descisions on your own; if you are mature anough to decide who you want to run your country, how could you not be mature enough to decide something as insignificant as music choice? Authors, artists, composers, and phtographers, all by living in @LOCATION1, all have the right to the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. By censoring what products are published and put in public takes away that right. Some @MONTH1 argue that the artists and authors still have the right to express themselves, but they are expressing material that is to risque or graphic to promote. This is an understandable point, but who is the government to promote only what they want to promote? Why should the government have total control over the @CAPS1 are exposed to? If this were to happen, could it easily be taken too far by power hungry poloticians? Wouldn't @LOCATION1 no longer be a democracy, but rather a communist country, like @LOCATION2?     American prides itself in being a 'mixing pot', and being accepting. If @LOCATION1 were to be like @LOCATION2, that would mean the restriction of expression and originailty throughout the country. Would you really want to live in a country where originality isn't really original, and acceptance was only what the goernment decided was acceptable? Would you be proud to live in a place where people don't have the opportunity to express themselves to others freely? I wouldn't.      Although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale, but censorship is censorship. It is discrimination agaisnt composers of a certain genre of works. It is the removal of choice from @CAPS1' lives. It is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech. Whichever way you look at it, censorship is censorship, and censorship is wrong	4	5	4
4273	2	Yes, I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are offensive and inappropriate.       People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner.  If people want to have heir things shown such, as movies or heard, such as music, it should be appropriate.  Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right.  Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies, or songs say to do.  Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things, they just want to be heard, or want attention.  When I listened to music or watched movies, I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger. I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right.  People just want to get their voice out there, and to be heard.      I learned to get my voice heard, I needed to do it in an appropriate manner.  Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of things to kids, but the only way to get there stuff out to the public is to make it offensive.     I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way, and the only way that I will be heard is to say and do the appropriate stuff. The way I look at things is @CAPS1 ( @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Do)	3	3	3
4283	2	Controversey and @CAPS1     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controvesial.     The creator of each song, movie, song, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine was not created for five year olds, but for desparate sex-crazed men, and @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 wasn't made for adults, but for young kids. Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative.      It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varrying ages getting into pornography. I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and uttterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree. Some religions think the @CAPS4 series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all. Controversey fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and choices.      Should I have the right to take away books from my child? My mother would not let me read the @ORGANIZATION1 books when I was younger. She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil. That make me desire to read it even more than before. When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices. I didn't see the devil in the books. I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book. The books reflected upon good vs. evil, which I saw as @CAPS5 vs. Satan. My opinions and views were very different than my mother's.     If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently. I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad. I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own.      All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons. We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts.	4	4	4
4288	2	Hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library. There are many, many things that shouldn't be exposed to children such as, sexcism,racism,rarted @CAPS3, pornography. So i am here today to tell you all about them things.      First off books that have racist comments in them should not be exposed to our young children.Why? Because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things thats the book does. Another thing is sex in books. I know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things. So to sum this up they shouldn't be allowed in public libraries.     The second thing that shouldn't be allowed in public libraries is @CAPS2-@CAPS3 movies. Things such as horror movies, porn, and many more. So young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age. It teaches them things that they shouldn't know about until they get a little bit older.      The last reason why I feel that many things shouldn't be in the libraries are for the @CAPS4 magazines. Those magazines just show everything they have all type of naked photos in them. These really do not need to be exposed to our young children because. Our little girls will think it is ok for them to take naked photos of themselves and post it in books and on the internet.      So all in all, all of these things should be banded from the libraries for many different reasons. So the @LOCATION1 should think about what I am saying. Just think if it were your children being exposed to innappropiate things	3	3	3
4304	2	In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @MONTH1 be something that someone might want to know about. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do.     Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because @MONTH1 be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible?      One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that @MONTH1 be offensive to you.     Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. That is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? There would be nothing left.      In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see. So keeep the books on the shelves	4	4	4
4306	2	I think that they libraries should not remove any of the books they have now. If parents or people dont want to read those type of books they dont have to. But they should'nt be removed. I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but thats part of the book and how the story was made. When a book is made they way it is and is already published there should'nt be any changes made to it.            If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes should'nt be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate. Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind. I know I do. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes discribed but to a certain age. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and thats a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents should'nt be too worried. So in my opinon I dont think they should be removed from libraries. On the other hand movies that have scenerios that are disturbing should be removed.           Movies are a whole different thing then books. They show the material that is being described and I dont think teens should be watching that. They can be very unappropriate and disturbing to some people like me. I would'nt want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibbling. Then again its just my opinion. If parents are okay with there child or children watching that then it should'nt be a problem.           Music is'nt that bad. There are a lot of parents who dont want there child or children listening to a sertain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in. I totally agree. My parents at the beggining would'nt let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over. As I got older they did'nt care much because I would'nt listen to it as much. Im a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age. Some of what they sing does'nt even make much sense. In libraries I think they should only have music that realates in some how to the books.     Magazines are not really a problem. Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips. They have horoscopes and give advise. A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celeberties and there life style. It has some what gossip. There mostly for older teens and grown ups. For younger teens and kids there's more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celeberties.      This is my point of view on things. I know that a lot of people dont entirely agree with me but this is what I think. I also know that there @MONTH1 be a lot of people who agree with me and they'll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice	3	4	3
4316	2	I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books. People should enjoy reading all types of books. Some people only read different books. Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction. It should not matter what other people think.     If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read. Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves. What would happen? I will tell you, you would lose customers.     If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books. If that won't work, then make an age limit. Have the parents show you their berth certificate. Have a resticted section in the library. In order to get a book from the resticted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed.     Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either. The other things you can figure it out on your own.     This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should go on in the library. I will give you some advise. Think before you do. That is all I am going to tell you.	3	3	3
4320	2	Do I belive that ceratin materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?    Wath I am going to discuss about is do I belive certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I will also talk about my introduction, abody and conclution.          Do I belive that books, music, movies, magazines, and anything else in any book shelves or any other shelves that is offensive to anyone should be removed. I think this because nobody should be offended by anything. Everyone should not live offended by anything or anyone.      I just explaned and talked about if the offensive things in shelves should be removed, and I answerd yes. I also talked about the introduction, a boby, and introduction	2	2	2
4322	2	Do you believe that books or any different materials should be removed from the libraies shelf. No, because them books or materials is not for everybody to look at. Like if you have kid's you should keep them and a kid's area. We cannot just start takeing down every book off the shelf because it was not a good book.The reason why kid's should stay and the kid's area is so they want pick up that book thats not for them. We will need the read to be reading childrens book.If a kid's pick up a bad book you should explaine to them that this book is not for them. Some books are @CAPS1 for kid's to read. so thats why they have there on area to be in. Kid's should not leave there area for a @CAPS1 book. I think that kids should list to appropiate music and a libriary.  The @CAPS1 book or materials are not for the kid's to read so they should not be and that area to pick up a bad book. i feel like there are no bad book out there if you dont like the book maybe someones elese will. but like movies, music, and magazines should not be off the shelf because if it was @CAPS1 it would not be and the libriary and the first place. Everybody is not going to like everything but thats just life	3	3	3
4338	2	The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a  childrens shelf  to read, but rather on an adult shelf .     I believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we dont agree on there beliefs. If  every book that was found offensive was taken of  a shelf we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive.     Many children are intersted in certain thing and we cant hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes againts family morals or valus such a religous beliefs. It would be a good thing to monater what your children are reading, wacthing and listening to.     On the other hand adult shelfs will have many diffrent things that would be offensive to many diffrent people unlike childrens books. Writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it @MONTH1 not be pleasing to me or any other person.      But what if we write a book and sombody does not like it then we wouldnt like it if they took it off the shelf. that would show direpect to a person who has thought long and hard on there work. Learn to stand proud on what you believe. Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books, music and magazines	3	3	3
4347	2	When i go to the library, most of the time, I'm doing research on a specific topic. The information I want, is the facts that really happened, or took place. This would not be possible if they censored all the material the offended somebody.     Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we're reading, or researching. It is important for readers and researches, to connect and take in all the information they read. That is what keeps us interested in what we are doing.     Authors write the things they write, for a reason. Taking there hard work off the shelves, because some little thing offends someone, is not fair to them. Besides, either way, someone is getting offended, because the auther is goin to get offended, for taking his hard work off the shelves.     As you @MONTH1 tell, i am against censoring our libraries. The way i see it, is that if something offends you, then dont look at it	3	3	3
4390	2	I believe that things shouldn't be taken off the shelfs because a few people are offended. There @MONTH1 be a few that don't like something but for every few that don't like it there are some who do. For example there might be a book that makes females look dumb but personally it doesn't affect me but there are some girls who get offended because thier superior knowledge.     I have a friend who gets offended by movies that the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first. So if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left. I feel offensive when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves. Even though I feel offended I'm not going to request them to remove it because there are some magazines that give tips and actually helps people feel better about themselves and if I took that away from them it could cause issues.     If there is something that is removed from shelves it should have a good reason. Like if there was a magazine that showed nudity I would understand them removing it so a kid doesn't see it.Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a great issue. Maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and every one swarms the stand attacking each other. Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued.     Yes I agree that there are some people who would request the  stuff to be removed but you can't always get your way. I know people would say thats not fair but there is a saying that says 'life isn't fair' and thats true. So next time you hear some one wanting something removed tall them this or next time you want some thing removed you refer back to this.     So in conclusion things shouldn't be removed unless nessecary. So when someone is offended thats their problem. You can always walk away you dont have to look or listen.	4	4	4
4393	2	In this world you never know what someone might writing. There're many materials in this world that I think aren't appropiate for someone to be reading, watching or listenning, ect.  You @MONTH1 be thinking that anyone makes his/her own decision of what they read, watch, listen.  Well, I do agree with that, but I do believe that some materials aren't rate it properly to age.  I do think that some materials should be banned from people under age, some from kids, and some from everyone.      You @MONTH1 be thinking that all of this is wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, ect., but in my opinion some materials are just offensive and not proper. I seen so many materials that I think are not proper for people under age to been looking at. In some movies, for example, the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or language.  You might not think it's that big of a deal, of course, but I do. In my opinion, some materials are not too low in rating, and should not be for people under age.     It's not surprising to me that kids are now yelling, hitting, and or acting like a rebels to their parents. Many of this things kids get it from books, music, movies, ect. This is many of the reasons some materials should be banned from kids.  You ask yourself why? Well, first of all, kids are just learnning and they do everything they watch, see, or listen. I mean now kids don't even think about what their about to do.  They just do, they don't care, they think it's okay. I think that parents should be alert to offensive materials in the shelves, and should say something about it so they banned them.     Why banned some materials from everyone?  Well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are not right? You @MONTH1 be thinking that we just do it for fun and that it's enjoyable and nothing wrong with it. Well, you @MONTH1 be right but also wrong.  I certainly do agree with you, we all watched things for fun and to enjoy them, but some things are just too out of this world for us. Why do people do crazy things now in these day? In my opinion, I think is because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, ect.  I think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what. It's the right thing to do.     If you don't want to see this world get more out of control than it already is. Well, we need to do something about all these materials that are offensive and banned them for good.  We certainly don't want to see our kids yelling, hitting, or and actting like rebels to us. We don't want some crazy person coming to our hosue and do crazy things to us just because that's what they learn from those materials they had on the shelves.  It's come to me that some materials should be banned from people under age, from kids, and some from everyone	3	4	3
4396	2	Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle?     Everyone in this world is entitaled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people @MONTH1 be right to others. For example, one family @MONTH1 view their children using curse words as offensive while another @MONTH1 see no problem. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence disscused in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear.     It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability so see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspecitves does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the aknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored.     In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion.	4	3	4
4405	2	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The material should be removed if they offend their gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race.     The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text.     Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrostist from this offensive content.     The material also should be removed if it is offending someones race. First, the material @MONTH1 call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's very offensive name( not directly but in general). Second the material can speak of the race as if was bad. Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race.     The material that is offensive to anyones gender,religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. the library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting not to offend other people in all ways.	4	4	4
4406	2	Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is innapropriete for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library.     To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child @MONTH1 not be aware. I believe they're certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older.      To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they seen on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in. This could result in a huge confrontation.      Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something.      To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what @MONTH1 cause problems to certain people. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by making a seperate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it.	4	4	4
4410	2	I belive that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive.  If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves.  Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @MONTH1 not teach them.  If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote.  If certian literature were not around anymore then it definitly would not be the same as it is now.  Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if if one @CAPS1 was taken away, it would start a riot.     Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality.  Imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society.  If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything.  Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society.  Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.'  Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart.     Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking?  Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers.  They have problems just life people of the real world even though they @MONTH1 not be real themsleves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about there problem.  Important history books of movies could be taken away becaus it 'offends' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to have students learn about slaves.     If one @CAPS1 was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society.  What good does that do anyone?  It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about.  It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of aproppriateness.  If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now.  No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.     Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down.  If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries.  They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe.  Information of any kind is a good @CAPS1 no matter the content of it.  So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea.	4	4	4
4412	2	READ WITH @CAPS1     I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.     Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' into the adults section.     In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read. the knowledge contained within them unknown.     There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand.     With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented. Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released.	5	4	5
4426	2	There are things in the world that are not ment for certain people to see. Things like rated @CAPS1 movies, @CAPS2 books, alcohol, and @CAPS2 music are not ment for children. Yes people have rights, they can view whatever they want. If a @CAPS4 wants to see a rated @CAPS1 movie or drink a beer that is the parents choice to let that @CAPS4 see that movie not the person running the store. If you are under the age limit a store keeper should have the right to tell you, you can't go in the store or buy his product.           Is it okay for a storkeeper to to tell your @CAPS4 no? Some would say yes to this and others would say no. If your @CAPS4 is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood, and killing, and you don't want your @CAPS4 to have this movie you might be mad if a store keeper let your @CAPS4 buy it. On the other hand you might be mad if this store keeper told your @CAPS4 he wasnt allowed to buy this movie. If the rated @CAPS1 is based on maturaty how does this store keeper know how mature your @CAPS4 really is? Your @CAPS4 could be a one that likes to copy the things they see on movies, the store keeper doesn't know if this is true or not. He doesn't know this @CAPS4, he can't say if he is mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood, and killing. How would this store keeper feel if this @CAPS4 watched this movie he let the @CAPS4 buy and the @CAPS4 went out and killed someone, how would you feel if this happened? This wouldn't happen if there was an age limit.     If a group of @NUM1 year olds who just got their license go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who is going to stop them from drinking and driving if there is no age limit on drinking? Lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving. When your @NUM2 years old you don't think about whats going to happen after you make a choice, you just think about how fun it's going to be while your doing it. Most 12-@NUM2 year olds aren't mature enough to make decisions in the spure of the moment.      There for there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like weather or not your @CAPS4 can buy a candy bar or a soda. But an age limit on buying an @CAPS1 rated movie, alcohol, guns, knives exc. What would the world be like if children went around with these things? With an age limit on ceritain this there wouldn't be a probelm with these things	3	3	3
4429	2	Do you find books you read offensive?  How about music, or magazines?  I sure don't.  I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read.  If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.       I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book.  A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time.  They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time.  Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down.  I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.     Music on the other hand could be thought of as different.  Many people could take music in the wrong way.  A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap.  Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language.  I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them.  Music can also be on the good side too.  When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax.  Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.     Then you have magazines.  Personally I think they are the worst of all.  Magazines tend to go one way or the other.  They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them.  One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story.  In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about.  Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.       In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library.  There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side.  Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it.  With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music.  Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy.  There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way.  I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement.	4	4	4
4437	2	Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public. This is important because a child could easily gain access to the offensive material. Censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries.           The libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive materials that they took from the shelves. A good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them. The libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them. Their is no reason to give people access to material that could be offensive to other people.           There are only a few reasons why I think that people should have access to offensive materials. Someone could need to use a book that has something offensive in it, but they would all be taken away to somewhere else. I think that it depends how offensive the materials are, as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves.      Although I am sort of split on this issue, there are some very good reasons why to move the offensive materials away from the shelves. Those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country, and they should not have access to them. We should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt	3	3	3
4440	2	Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information.     Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is.     If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen.     That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy.      In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to.There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand.	4	4	4
4441	2	Censorship is very important, especially when you are reffering to libraries. I believe that each individual person is entitled to an opinion. If a certain book, magazine, movie, etc., is offensive to one specific person or a wide variety of people, those individuals should consult an official who has authority and decides what goes on and off the shelfs about what they think or feel about their choice of selection.     In the world, there are many different types of minorites, racial groups, and also differences in political groups, (@CAPS1 and @CAPS2). Even though these seperate groups are extremly different from one another, they all share one thing in common. No matter who believes what or who supports who, everyone will always have a difference in voice. Some people @MONTH1 feel that having particular material displayed on shelves of libraries is rather offensive to specific individuals. Where as others like myself say, as said earlier, if you are to have a problem with something displayed, then you should contact someone who will listen to what you have to say. For example, I cannot express that I desire to have something removed from a library shelf just because I am the one who finds the material a concern. Not everything is decided by me. It would be incredibly rude to state that something is offensive to me might not be to someone else. Just because I don't approve of something gives me no right to purposely remove something from the shelf. That is all related to freedom of speech. However, yes, you do in fact have the right to say what bothers you, but you do not own the privledge of doing what you want at any time because you have opposesed views.     It is true to say that we all argee we do not want to see inapropriate material displayed on library shelfs, especially for childrens sake, ergo, libraries should take major consideration of restricting specific areas of a library for adult views only. I know suggestive material might be a concern for one, so not allowing children of a certain age to see certain material would be a highly good idea for any worried officals, adults, and parents.	3	4	3
4447	2	There are all kinds of books, movies, and even magazines out there. Most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie. They could even have stuff that the young minds should not read. Have you ever thought about what would happen if a little kid grabbed onto something that he/she was not supposed to read? When it comes to things like this, there is a huge range of topics. Some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age. Thats why I think there should be a certain section where only a certain amount of ages are allowed to go.     When it comes to books, there will always be some books that are not apporbiate for the young mind. They could include multiple things that could scar a kid for life. Some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future. Books are great for learning, dont get me wrong, but there are some that are more adult related. Now there are a ton of books that kids can read and parents won't need to worry about them reading.     Another way libraries can help is put the movies in a certain section. The library could make a section called 'family and kids'. This section would hold a perfect spot where parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids getting the wrong ideas from movies. In our library, we have this section. My grandma and I would always go there and find an incredible family movie to watch together. Finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling ever.     Finally the last way a library could help is by making sure the child is old enough to check out a book or a movie. Clearly a child of @NUM1 shouldn't check out a movie that is rated @CAPS1, thats just wrong. Libraries should make sure the child is at the correct age to check out the movie. Thats why the movie companys rate movies, so they can give people heads up about whats good and bad about the movie. Also the libraries should make sure a kid is checking out the apporbiate type of magazine or book. The people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read. There are an infinte amount of ways we can protect the minds of young ones.     I dont think libraries should banned books, magazines, movies, or even music. I think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read. Books are a great way to learn things, but they should be learning about the stuff that is sustable for their age. Libraries are there for us to learn and enjoy ourselves. I believe people would get upset if they would banned the stuff they love. They should just keep an eye out of what kids are looking at. Thank you for your time.	3	3	3
4455	2	Libraries, they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them. Whether a book is being read about @PERSON1 or the @CAPS1 there is always something influential to be read. Some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages. The question is, is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves? In personal opinion; yes those types of books are influential, yes it is possible that it could negatively effect the youth of @DATE1, but everyone has the right to read what interests them.     Being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials. There is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books. Is this a bad thing? Is it 'bad' to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience? No, having experiences is only half the point of living; sharing it is the rest. The @ORGANIZATION1 explains one of the more major downfalls in @LOCATION1 and how it brutally effected the people struggling for life and money. Twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone. These are not only experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake.     The youth of @DATE1 is portrayed in mostly a negative light. Whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devils offspring; our youth need influences. Reading is one of the major sources of inspiration for students to grow and prosper. Most students find reading to be boring. In school you are not offered what you want to read. Lists are made, and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught. Young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds. Taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read.     Teachers, principals, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like. If you were a sports major and suddenly the population decided sports journals and sports themselves were too harmful and badly influential to people; what would you do when suddenly everything sports related was taken away? You would lose your career. Romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds. Taking away something that is related to something so natural in every day life would have severe reprocussions; especially for those who greatly enjoy those books. Revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed.     Influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives. Just because someone is a student or a child doesn't mean that a literary work could rot their mind. Taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative, inventive, and inspired world. Not everyone believes that certain books are bad, and i, am one of those  thousands of people.	4	4	4
4456	2	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and etc., be removed from sheleves if they are found offensive? Should them magazines and etc., but put up in a place for that age group? Should them type of things but in the @CAPS1 with children? Should they be in @CAPS1's period?                                                                     I thing that the @CAPS1 should have all type of books in there because that's what a @CAPS1 is for. But I do think that if people are finding it offensive to have them type of books open to children they should ask the @CAPS1 to change how they have the books. But I also think the @CAPS1 should put them book up in a part were they have adult things and book at. Because them type of book isn't made for children eyes.                  The @CAPS1 should put people ages on the @CAPS1 cards so that this want be a problem to the poeple or the @CAPS1. Because then you would no how old they are . And only @NUM1 years of age can she the books and magnizines, etc., that isn't right for young children eyes. But I Do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and there children are reading it . And it is offensive to the people that just dont like what the book, music and magazines stand for.           One thing I don't agree on is that books should be taking off the shelves because there are so people that comes to the @CAPS1 just to read them books. And the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves. Because me personal I like the magnizes, books , music and the movies and I don't find nothing offensive about them. And I like the movies to because it gives me somthing to do and watch when I am at home.          I also think that the movies and music is something we all love that's in the @CAPS1. Because it give me and my friends something to do after school. So if you take away the thing we like what will we have to do after school when we go to the @CAPS1. And the thing's that was named make the @CAPS1 so fun an peaceful.  The @CAPS1 is a place were you can come and whine your day down. With out them thing there trying to take of the shelves it's going to be boring. People who don't have nothing to do doing the day come to the @CAPS1 and look for that offensive stuff.	3	3	3
4463	2	Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future.                 Censorship is extremely dangerous to a soceity because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and many other environmentalist around the globe of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment.                                                                            Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that @MONTH1 cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellilectual. Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The @CAPS5' by @PERSON1, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology.     Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the @LOCATION1 bin @CAPS7 killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 of @ORGANIZATION1, military, and @CAPS9. That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 news. I'd rather of coursebe notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To @CAPS11 a @CAPS12' or '@PERSON3' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it.     Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship..	4	4	4
4467	2	I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 belive that any kind of material such as books, movies, magazines, ect., should be censored ecept for mature content such as pornography, violent and horrid movies and video games. But thats why we have @ORGANIZATION1's made. So when asked, we can show our age. Some age groups react diffrently to mature contents. Usually @NUM1 and up is a tollerable level for maturity to set in.     Maturity is maintained at diffrent paces in all age groups. For example, perhaps a @NUM2 year old is more mature than an @NUM3 year old. It is when you as a individual can act like a human being. Instead of like a pack of rabid wolves. Just because you do not act mature dosen'@CAPS2 mean you dont know how to be civilized.     The best way to prevent a child from discover something inapropriate or vulgure is to, seperate the books by an age grouping system. Keep adult videos out of site and reach of children. Also put saftey locks on your @CAPS2.V. to prevent kids from sneaking behind your back	3	3	3
4474	2	Should we have censorship in our libraries?  This is a question that both sides can argue with creditable facts.  However, censhorship is mostly defined as not allowing certain items or things to be seen or heard of until a mature age.  How can you tell when someone is of a mature age?  Maturity lies behind one's self to cope with various thoughts, ideas, actions, etc.  Censorship should be allowed to an extent.     Censhorship plays a big role in society today.  It has changed the content on our television from @NUM1 years ago to modern day.  The government is more leniant today then they were @NUM1 years ago.  On television @NUM1 years ago, you would never hear a sware word, or see a couple sleep in the same bed.  Now, some sware words are considered okay, because people can handle them.  It is like they are part of our daily vocabulary now.  Censorship has changed a lot.     Books of all sorts should be allowed to children and adults of all ages.  Certain literature provides a cornucopia of topics and subjects to be helpful to a processing brain.  We learn and understand at different rates.  Some books with 'adult content' @MONTH1 be suitable for more intelligent minds.  Authors sometimes put in so-called 'adult content' to add suspense and drama towards the bigger picture or message behind their work.  Books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning.     Movies are differnent.  Some movies have sexual content that our youth should not see.  Most magazines have the same principles as movies do.  They are both rated differently on levels of age.  Therefore, we can protect their innocence and fellow youth.  Music is healthy to the mood of a person.  Music should not be censored.  People just have different tastes in music.  Some @MONTH1 be fond of other genres and some @MONTH1 dislike the other genres.  There is a wide array of music that people can enjoy.  There is no way to censor the universal language that music provides.     Censorship should come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear.  Censorship of books is not fine, but censorship of movies and magazines are acceptable.  Music, however, can not be censored.  The lyrics and sounds speak to many people in strange ways.  It is all helpful in the end.  Everyone should have the right to watch, read, or listen to whatever they want.  It all comes down to learning, and there is no censorship on learning.  So, please do not censor our libraries.  Allow the adults to censor what should be censored in their families	4	4	4
4483	2	PARENTS @CAPS1                            @CAPS2 @CAPS3                        I believe that certain materials should not be shown. But then some books are not offensive too everybody, so it would be unfair if all books were removed from libraries. I can relate too @CAPS2 discovering books that's not educational for them. It's up too the parents too show their @CAPS2 what too read and what not too read. This can also happen with movies, certain movies that @CAPS2 can and can't watch. The reason I say this is because if it was up too @CAPS2 on their own too decide what they would want too do, it would usually be negative results. Thats what parents are for.      I was young myself and I had experienced this too at one point. The type of movies I watched, I thought they were pretty cool, but I was too young too realize what I was watching and what I was trying too do from a movie. I had too learn from my parents that the things I were doing was not rational. Then I realize that I was making mistakes. It was nothing cool about it. friends had told me that as well. So i figured out the hard way. I don't want any @CAPS2 to experience that.      Not all parents can stop all @CAPS2 from discovering some disburbing things from books, music, magazines and all. What I'm trying too say that it can be reduced. Some parents can prevent it from happening. somethings can get in sink too a @CAPS2 brain and it could never be helped or solved. These things are serious and some people don't take it likely. And thats where it takes effect. Its up tookids parents or role models to show that some things are'nt meant for them too see until the right time.          I'm not telling parents to trap their @CAPS2 from the world. What I'm saying is that parents should let them know that their going to witness some things. They just have to be prepared too see them and hopefully it does'nt take a negative impact on them. Hopefully they would be smart enough too tell what's right from wrong. Its up too the parents to assist their @CAPS2. Its up too the @CAPS2 too know whats good for them.     I do believe that some @CAPS2 are capable of growing out of some events they learned from movies, too know that they were young, because I grew out of that myself. And if I can do it, so can they. Its not impossible. One good thing is that some @CAPS2 grow up in a positive community to know not read disturbing books/magazines, or watch disturbing movies.	3	3	3
4486	2	Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries? No I do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries. A librarie should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies.     One reason I think that a librarie should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing. Like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories. So maybe the kids that read sport books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the librarie because some kids like to read gory books.     Another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc, is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things. People would get bored if their librarie only had books about war. Kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories. Also if your librarie has all different kinds of magazines kids could learn a lot of interesting facts. You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine. So if you only had four magazines about the same thing kids wouldn't discover anymore cool facts.     A librarie is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things. So I think if you started taking specific things out of the librarie then I think kids would stop coming to the librarie. A librarie contains awsome infromation that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out then not that many kids will come to the librarie because they will not be learning @CAPS1 new.     So if I had any say in this I would keep all things in the librarie. I would not remove @CAPS1! You want people to come to your librarie so you dont want to do @CAPS1 that can jeperdize people coming to your librarie. I think if you start removing things then your going to have less and less people come in and eventually maybe your librarie will get shut down because you have no buisness. So leave everything on the shelves.	4	4	4
4492	2	Every we go there is censorship. Childrean hear their parents saying them and are more than likely to repeat them. Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do. It should be up to the children what they read.       Books should be censored if they are made for children. Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like. Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also. We can learn something from any thing we read.     There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can. When uncensensored things are said aloud children are estatic. If they read themselves they would learn alot more. If your parents do not inform you either, you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life.      It is very unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies.Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see. The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent.     I always think it is a bad idea to have derrogatory pictures on magazines. These photos @MONTH1 give children negative thought, such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model. Children remember almost everthing they hear/see. It should be up to the children what they read.	3	3	3
4494	2	Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea.      People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea.      As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me.      For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in. So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interrests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library	4	3	4
4506	2	Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years. In many school libraries certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed because of the content in them. These items can be removed for these common types of content wich include, use of violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inapropriate language. Many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school. Most parents would not want to find out that their kids are being introduced to such things at a young age, because it could influence them to participate in these activities.     In my opinion I do believe that certain material in school libraries should be removed but not in public libraries because a public library can be divided into sections depending on age groups. Inn elementry and middle school libraries, items should be censored because young students do not need to be introduced to things that are inapropriate or violent in anyway. In a school environment kids should only be introduced to drug use, and sexual activity through some sort of health class because there is where they will learn the true facts and it would be more educational for them, rather than hearing about drugs, sex, and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie.     Many kids watch movies that have very violent, and inapropriate scenes, and some of the songs in the world today are exstreamly inapropriate for young kids. Their are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students at school because of the content in them, this is why I do believe that censorship in libraries is a great thing.	3	3	3
4525	2	Libraries have books that are short, long, and everything in between. Their are good and bad books, but that all depends on the opinion of the reader. There is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf. The books on a shelf in the library are there for everyone to read so if one is removed then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book.     Would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste any good to you? No, you wouldn't get it again. So why'd someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended it isn't right your views on something are only an opinion nothing more. Your views are not the same as @PERSON1's who lives down the street so by removing a book it is pushing your views on somone else.     In conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it. Pushy people aren't normally liked by others. Books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader. That is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf.	3	3	3
4547	2	I do believe that we can have Materials because there are some good materianls thats have some good stuff in that.Book yes if we don't have no book we can't leave. If we don't have book how we people know how to read.Music i will said yes and no because some time music is not good but some time people need music to do they work. I will say know to magazines because it be to much in that.It be stuff thin them that @CAPS1 sould not see.	2	1	2
4562	2	Censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around. As expressed by Katherine Paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unexceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that he or she deem unexceptable. Everyone has an individual view of what is unexceptable, so that @MONTH1 leave no book to be left on the shelf. In saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to keep them from banning all that is there. There is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government @MONTH1 not see it a something to be censored. This brings up another question, what deems something unexceptable to be viewed? In my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon? I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. It is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material.      The government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time. The novel, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' was onced censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers. If this work were to remain banned, this canon of american culture, the effect that it had on american literature to this day would have been lost.      I see literature as another form of art. Art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society. Artists are ones to take risks and so are writers. If people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? Developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as risk. Should we have censored them?     Another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the @CAPS2 regime. Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under @CAPS3's rule. A whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed enexceptable just because he did not like them. Now, should we put the power of picking what is unexceptable into the hands of one group of people? Whole generations of books, music, etc. could be at stake under such principles. There should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation.      The government, with the ability to censor libraries, can hinder our exposure to ideas unknown to us. Lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it. Who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature? Nothing stopped them from banning 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1,' so is there limit? This is the question one has to ask themselves, to keep the government from potentially cutting the nation off from future masterpieces.	5	5	5
4582	2	Books are to be read not taken off beacuse of what they say. That to me is stupid are childern live in world of war and fear everyday what is a damn book gonna change? Nothing there gonna hear the f word and see blood and gore. Would you rarther them see it for the first time in real life and not know what to do.      Music is one thing that can bring everybody together. So by are childern not being able to hear some of them lyrics then we are pushing them into being pussys. Maybe there just some real people teelling the truth that you dont want your kid to hear.     Movies are something that people love to watch come on we pay @MONEY1 to get onto see them sometimes. Are kids are gonna be better because there parnets didnt want them to see the new horror movie there gonna see in real life one day why not now?     Parnets your not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world YOUR @CAPS1 US @CAPS2 because when we get into that sitituation in real life we arent gonna know what to do then were scewed.	3	3	3
4600	2	Censorship is method of limiting certain contant that has been deemed inapropriate. This method is widely used today in the modern world. Censorship is used most commonly with our movies, video games, and television. If other forms of entertainent like television and internet utilize such methods shouldn't our libraries.Also if these methods are not made manditory should there be a block on certain tittles that our children could get there hands on.       This limiting agent called censorship can be very usefull in our everyday lives. Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view. This agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions, computers, and phones. So if the procautionary measuers are being taken on the following products wouldn't it be appropriate for the actions to also be in our libraries. Shouldn't our libraries be a place for children to waunder through the shelves picking up and reading books at random without the thought of picking up an inaproiate book for their age group. Personally that is what a library should be like to me.         Discussing the topic that was touched on before .A block should be manditory for libraries. This block would not abolish the books completly but rather would limit their viewing audience. The books should be cateragized by age group. And with the block certain children, based on age ,would not be able to enter the section and would prevent certain materals from reaching children that are not mature enough.     Certain materials should not be view by younger children. That is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact. The factual experiance comes into play when young children are reading and looking at pictures that were intended for maturer audiences. These tittles heavily influence a childs thoughts and actions. Just the other day a cousin of mine no older than @NUM1 years old was watching two individuals of the opposite sex and began asking questions such as: when are they going to kiss? or why is he not touching her? These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view. The origin of these question will probably never be known but there are ways to prevent such topics from being brought up and that is censoring what children read, view or listen to in our libraries	4	4	4
4601	2	Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to.  It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it	3	3	3
4612	2	In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away.     A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do @CAPS4. Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. @CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature.     '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, @CAPS4 is not the case. @PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with.     Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning.	5	4	5
4629	2	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. This quote says it all, if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive. Books are often written for the enjoyment of the reader, and if not that books are for informational purposes. Not everybody will have the same views of one book as someone else does, so it would be unfair to not be able to read it because someone else doesn't want you too.     Personally I like to read books that interest me, as i can assume most do everyone else. Generally to keep my attention, I like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot. I realize that some people would find this offensive and not acceptable for children, but I consider myself a good kid now and I am not negatively affected by those books I read. When I was a kid in @NUM1 grade, I read a book far beyond what most @NUM1 graders read. This book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur, but I was mature enough to handle them. Just the other year, the librarian, whom I stay in constant contact with, asked me if she should take the book off the shelf. I told her no, with my reason being that I found it to be a very interesting book! I would have been upset to see a great book no longer be accessable because of some vulgar language, because what it comes down to are just words that express heavy emotion.     Many books such as, the dictionary or encyclopedia's are used for informational purposes. These books can also be accessed by children. I myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for 'bad words'. Does that make it jusitifiable to remove? Even the books we read in school today have 'bad words' in them. When I was a freshman in high school, my @CAPS1 teacher talked about how the school board tried to get rid of 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3', because it had racial slurs and much racism involved. She was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students. Books just can't be taken out of the hands of high schoolers because some uptight adults think it is offensive, when in all reality they teach great morals and lessons for the youth.      If you take a look at politics you can see that not everybody has the same opinion and some can be very vocal about their's. The same idea can go with any topic in the world today. Somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite. This is the issue with taking books off the shelves. One person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book. My personal opinion is that a book is a book and people are going to interperte them differently. So if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone. There is no point! If someone shouldn't read that book then they shouldn't be allowed. The answer is as simple as that.     When it comes down to it people are just going to have to get over not having their way, because they want a book removed from the shelf. Most people are offended by something and usually not everybody is offended by the same thing, which makes this issue impossible to deal with. There is only one answer to this question of: Should the library be censored? The answer is no, just let it be. The book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it. In the end of it all a book is just a book	4	5	4
4631	2	Many people have different views on censorship. Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe the be true or not true, or very improtant to them, also called freedom of speech. Also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @MONTH1 be appropriate.      I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then @PERSON1 was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.           Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @MONTH1 be as long as they are along the right age. If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and voilence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf. You do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that. People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but I also do believe there is a certain extent.	3	3	3
4636	2	People should have a right to listen, read, and watch whatever they want. It is people's own choice to what they read, watch, or listen to. They will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books. They will only go somewhere else and do it.      People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they feel is good for them. If others find that offensive then that is their problem. People make their own decisions and that is their right. I feel that if you tell someone that they can not do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more.      Taking offensive books, music, movies, and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has with being offensive to others, it will only mask it. Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others, they just won't do it in libraries.            Every book, music or movie will be offensive to some other person and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read. It is just something that we will have to deal with. So I do not agree with censorship in libraries.      It will only take away our right to read and view what we want but also it will take away all the offensive movies and books we have; which is almost every book. Everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries	3	3	3
4644	2	Libraries are normally a safe quiet place for people to go set down drink a cup of coffee and read a book/magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of there favorite music.  But, some people don't use it as that.  They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people that are trying to have some time just to them selves while there children are away or had a bad day and to regroup and get ready for the next day. But then we ask our selves why do people want to set at a library and read.  Why can't they just check out a book, cd, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library?     I don't see what the big deal is to this! Most counties have a public libarary.  That is meaning they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at there stuff.  Yes, I can see libraries making the person checking out a book sign a letter or document, giving personal information as in a telephone number, address, or credit card number.  The letter would be saying that they have this much time with this book and they needed it back on a certain date or else they need to bring it back in a get it renewed so they can't accuse of anyone stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer.  Most places have what they call late fees.  Normally, if someone has a late fee then you aren't going to get that book back because they don't want to pay it so I feel as if giving them a credit card number they can just keep charging there account and get the money that way for the late fees. Because they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they recieve in the mail from the libabry in the trash.      I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never ending process with certain people because some of them just don't care.     Yes, the internet would be a little diffrent because not everyone has money to get the internet at there house.      I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junkey.  My ideas to me are good ideas and I feel like we can put Libraries into good use around this county and @LOCATION1	2	3	2
4686	2	What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is @CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to.      Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer.      I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore?           Another issue is banned books. @CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school. @CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? @CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, '@CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?      Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.      I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn	4	4	4
4711	2	Censorship in the @CAPS1     @CAPS2, what is offensive to some @MONTH1 not be to others. So how do we know when expressing ourselves in an artistic manner that we've gone to far? We don't and thats why censorship is such a controversial topic.      In the music industry recently there has been messages in songs and music videos that aren't the best suited for teenagers. Being a teenager is a time of constant turmoil in one's life, you are required to make decisions that will define you as a person. When songs out there are about drug use and other crimes teens see them as cool things and follow along cause they see them as everyday activities that can do no harm but little do they know that they are wrecking their life by doing this, so I somewhat agree with censorship in that kind of thing.     In literature and art things take a more serious tone than in music and other media. With literature it's about conveying ones thoughts and feelings about a story or other subject. In art you express yourself vissually on a canvas or abstractly through other materials and forms, but in both ways you express your feelings and emotins. So censoring these would in turn censor one voice and emotions. When you take away a man's voice and emotions you are left with an empty shell of a person who will never know life to the fullest.     As time has changed I have found that people have also changed. When @PERSON1 uses the '@CAPS3-word' in some of his literary works it didn't offend people at the time, but now times have changed. Now it's not ok that @PERSON1 used this word but on the other hand it's ok for rappers and others to say it every other word in their music. so how do we know what's offensive and what's not? well it's all from the reader, listener, or viewer's point of view.     These days parents try to sheild their children from the outside world and make it seem that it's all rainbows and butterflies by censoring things the children might be subject to read, hear, or see in their day to day lives. This does not solve the problems in the world there will always be war, crime, and death no matter how hard we try to stop it as long as there's 'good' there will always be 'bad'.     All loyalties aside in my honest opinion I believe censorship in the @CAPS1 is a bad idea and will never work to solve actual problems with the world. It will just cover them up just like the dialouge or image they so badly want to go away.	4	5	4
4713	2	Do I believe certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?  No, just because a book or song or magazine article or movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves.  Sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people.      Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf.  Its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books.  If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive we would have a lot of empy book stores.  Because face it people can and will be offended easily if something they believe, like religion, is being made fun of in a book that they had read about.       We all get offended but just move on from it and find something different.  We are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine.  We have a choice and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different, more positive, or go through the process to get it removed and taken off the shelf.  You never know someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was benefitial or relating.  So it should not be up to one person, but if a whole community has a problem with a book then I can see removing it can be an option	3	3	3
4718	2	If I found a book that I thought was innapropiate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into to see what she thinks about the book(s). If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it did needed removed. The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropiate for people to look at and it also depends on how old you are. Another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism.      If i found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or some teenagers. My opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and ect. Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies ans watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that was on the film. For example, if the movie/book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they  saw it on tv. Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie. But the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these, I think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen.      Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in music as it progresses. @NUM1 years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music. Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release it so everyone can listen to it.     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time	4	3	4
4722	2	In our socioty, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive.     People have the right to pick something up, over look it, and decide wheither it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made.     I agree, somethings are offensive, but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it, then dont let it bother you. I believe that music is a way that people express themselves. I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. If the material is to graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just should do it.	2	2	2
4730	2	Need help with Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1     (I chaged the @ORGANIZATION2 of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.)     To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2. Nothing really all  to serious I guess. . It seems the libaraiains there are censoring  tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1.      They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers.  There have also been some complates from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie .     To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have  already blocked all the inaproperate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school. So then I tryed to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the werid adult rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2. That way no kid will have nightmares any more.I also threw in the idea of seperarting all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child,teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3     The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw home big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundered pages of book at least. I was to scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I go to,to see if anyone else would be willing to help me.      So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article. I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists. I @CAPS8 you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing too,@CAPS8 You.	3	4	3
4748	2	No, materials should not be removed from the libraries.First most of books,movies and,music are the best way to support difffernt things.They all have there type of way of convinicing you.There are many different ways to understand but those are certainly the best ways.                          Like a movie some people like to see things to understand them.Because it take times for some people to see instead of reading or listening.It take people to just seat and watch is a great way.Some people that look at a movie an a wrong way get the wrong type of thought about something which make it offensive to them.                                                                    Like music is a great way to understand what someone is trying to say or get across.You have to take time out to really listen and here what they are taking about.If you here a song once and then you just take it a wrong way u never let your mind here what they said.Some people let one word or two make u think differnt about the song.So before u judge listen to the whole song.     A book one of the worlds best way to understand were someone is comeing from.A book is like a short life.If judge a book bye its first couple paragraphs you would never get a meaning out of it.With a book you have to give it a chance to seek in your mind so that you do get an understanding.A book can tell u alot of things.So some people take it offensive.     These types of materials should never be removed from labraries.This things are great ways to understand things.So if you take one thing offensive try another way maybe its a better way for people to understand it.Without this materials we would never understond,discovery anythong in are worl	2	3	2
4774	2	I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually. Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know.      People are not going to look at things the same. Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently. If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us. No more books, music, movies, and magazines.     Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are. American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind. So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer	3	3	3
5981	3	I believe the features of the cyclist affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn’t of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of him so he took the shortcut. After his experence he new haes to stat ?? to the mep and not trust people who havent seen changes in the last few years.  	1	1	1
5988	3	The setting of the authors “ shortcut” effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.” Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.” The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.” The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, “ success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.” I believe that @PERSON2 agrees.	3	2	3
5991	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride.	1	2	2
5992	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.”	1	1	1
5999	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road.	0	1	1
6019	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map	1	1	1
6033	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking “through the high desert of california in June.” So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases “a tarlike substance followed by brackish water” he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that “l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I’d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who’s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   	3	3	3
6065	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, “Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.”	2	2	2
6071	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist’s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in “the high deserts of California in June,” the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2	2	2
6078	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2	2
6079	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.” This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory” This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP” The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2	3	3
6093	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men adviced him cyclist had high hopes as a looked and senery enjoyed seeing very ? of the struggle.	1	1	1
6118	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist .At first the cyclist stoned off pretty easy .He had plat smooth roads to go through .He started out before the sun could to him.” The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite my name written all it “He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him .Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder .I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills “So he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster.” At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state “.By the tumble weeds that means he was in the desert during a hot period of time .So he had little water left and he was becoming dehydrated .This was a hard task for him to overcome .By the terrain changing it become harder for him.	3	2	3
6133	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn’t have much water to drink.	1	1	1
6140	3	The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6141	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again.	2	2	2
6143	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says “ The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don’t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh”. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3	2	3
6164	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was in the California desert and that made him think he was going to die out there.	2	2	2
6166	3	The setting affects of the cyclist was that the exhaustion was getting to him. What made it worse he was out in the heat sweating which also cause dihidration.	1	1	1
6175	3	"In the setting of “ Rough road ahead: do non excee posted speed limit.” The cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning the authour is enjoying a nice campground outside lodi California when “old-timers” told the cyclist directions and from his piont of view  ""they'd  sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off out land marks and spouting off towns  I would come to along this breezy aunt.” So the cyclist used that information and it wasn’t for   The Better."	1	1	1
6184	3	In the story “Rough road ahead” the setting affect’s the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by lack of water, the distance he has to travel, and the hilly terrain. “The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” this statement shows how he was out of water and was tired and hot. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in the story.	1	1	1
6195	3	  The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die…”. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally.	3	3	3
6204	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted spedd limit” by @PERSON1 many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first “town” and said, “this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war.” This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn’t so mild. He says, “The sight was troubling.” Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn’t get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welch’s Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it.	1	1	1
6213	3	The setting affect the cyclist features because if the cyclist was riding in @LOCATION1 around june the affect @MONTH1 not had been that harsh. But overall the setting out begin in a hot place with limited water was not a good thing. That’s how the cyclist is affected by the setting.	1	1	1
6216	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story. One of the things that affect him during the story is that it was a very hot, sun scorching day. Also he ran out of water and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around. Another thing is that when he ran out of water there was no snakes warmers  just desert so he started to become very thirsty. In the essay it also said he reached a part where she saw a sign that said “ Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limited, so the road conditions starting to get rough him that was another affect. In the end of the essay he reaches a camp where it is all peace and relaxed, and they have cold water there, this affects him because he feels replenished. All these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2	2
6218	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn’t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it’s the middle of June in California, it’s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says “Over one long, crippling hill”, he’s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.	2	1	2
6229	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the authour was not and augsosted and as she was ridding her bike there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle.	1	1	1
6241	3	This story was a great motivation for older man that can still be healthy and feel like an teenager again. It showed how much effort he put to his goal and how he survive. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink same water the cyclist was and interesting story not ginaupup	1	1	1
6256	3	Almost all of the cyclist’s surroundings are old and barren. Hot @CAPS1 like weather. The road is hard to ride on. “Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.” So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one.	1	1	1
6263	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would’ve lasted longer and he would’ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would’ve died. Luckily though it wasn’t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could’nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I’ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy. 	3	3	3
6274	3	"During the cyclist journey he was faced with many ?? ??. Mostly the driver ?? and out of water. In the essay it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search for water. It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. "	1	1	1
6275	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the not sun and the desserts and the low amount of energy supply he had left the reasons why  	1	1	1
6280	3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn’t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life.	3	3	3
6290	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1	1
6297	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.	1	1	1
6302	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, “The sun was beginning to beat down” This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun ??? him hard. Also when he states “I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,” this shows he was also dehydrated once goin, very slow because of the ammount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area.	2	2	2
6304	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1	1
6316	3	The features of the setting affects the setting by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says ''flatroad was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,” prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went  bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill.	1	1	1
6330	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"	3	3	3
6343	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn’t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1° degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2° degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in “No @CAPS2’s @CAPS3”. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels.	1	1	1
6392	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He also says, “Over one long, crippling hill.” As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence	3	3	3
6404	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead : Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,”  by Joe Kurmaskie”  the features of the setting affects the cyclist. Dehydration caused by heat could not enough water caused the cyclist to sweat and to feel nautious. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh. In this quote he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in an bad state. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	0	1
6427	3	"In the start story “Do not exceed speed limit,” time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist’s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the ""growing realization that I (the author)"	1	1	1
6428	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with winding roads and hills peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging, with the rider having little to know way or the roads were ten times harder to deal with. And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for.	1	2	2
6454	3	The cyclist in the story is @CAPS1 affected by the fatause of setting in the story. The Hill afected him becaus they have harder to get over.	2	2	2
6464	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn’t seen the land in a really long time. The man don’t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn’t know what to do.  	1	1	1
6469	3	In the story the cyclist is afected by setting because in the @NUM1 paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying to get water out. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he relizes that the old men didn’t know what they were talking about. Also at the end he is realived when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there. 	1	1	1
6470	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him” no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen “One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.” That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.	2	2	2
6474	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn’t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. “The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.” (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2	2
6498	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty. Than him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldn’t get any water. The hills made him tired and weak. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which made him powerless and thirsty.	1	2	2
6499	3	The features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. That effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to Yosemite slower because he needs to find water. That is a feature that affects the cyclist	1	1	1
6511	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2	2
6517	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1	1
6521	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn’t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6524	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn’t make it where he/she wanted to go.	2	2	2
6539	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up and he was afraid of the grass becase it was tall and scary looking.	1	1	1
6555	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town. The old people in the didn’t know they were tell him. It made it haede for nam because that more harder roads and lesort water. He almost died.	1	1	1
6558	3	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said ‘’ The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,’’ As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.	1	1	1
6569	3	In the cyclist’s outlook on his journey through Yosemite’s park, reader’s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.	1	1	1
6578	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.	3	2	3
6585	3	I guess really sofcty comes first, and you have to be cautious when yay out in the streets on a bicycle. I really don’t understand much, so I can’t write much.	0	0	0
6592	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3	2	3
6603	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unberable beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had no where around him to fill up his water bottle. So he was deing of thirst and he didn’t know where he was going or how far he had to go. The setting was crushal in this story.	1	1	1
6609	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you can’t put anything back in your skin and your body can’t function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didn’t think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made. He lived.	2	2	2
6618	3	There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist. Another feature would be the types of wild animals & scarceness of water around . Also, the old man who gave him unimportant & non-updated information. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would  wear & fear on his physical & mental strengths.	2	1	2
6622	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn’t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn’t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
6637	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen’t find water.	2	3	3
6640	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. It scared him which made him go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die it made him weak. The snake in the way caused him longer and every stop that had once there effected him to.	1	1	1
6644	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story.	1	1	1
6652	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first it was a bright shiny day and the cyclist was happy. He reaches the first town which is a ghost town and it makes him sad. Riding on he begins to lose water. The once bright shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist. He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated. The terrain become slopes and hills and the ride become harder, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone. But just over the hill was a fishing shop. He used his reining energy to speed down the hill to get water and get his energy back. 	1	1	1
6658	3	“@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water” all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn’t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip.	2	2	2
6659	3	The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The features in the story changed the speaker’s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey.	2	2	2
6669	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and aqusting. You get this picture from the author when the bikerider is describing his surroundings. The bikerider describes his as the high desserts of California in June, being hot and musky, ruff terrain, etc. This gives you an image of what the bike rider feels physically and emotionally. This image shows how tired, thirsty, and determined the bikerider really is. Using words, metaphors, and imagery the author puts you in the shoes of the bikerider emotionally and physically.	3	0	3
6686	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3	3
6713	3	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.	2	1	2
6752	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted.	2	2	2
6763	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn’t have had to go through the hardships.	2	2	2
6783	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren’t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamond back – blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to"	1	2	2
6787	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe.	2	1	2
6788	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn’t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn’t really sure about. It was hot he was running out of water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was running out. there were no sings he kept thinking that he would never take directions from an old guys and that he would stick to the future.	1	1	1
6803	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” “a large highway sign jumped out atm.” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.” “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The fact the it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer. When out of water you feel exostied. You will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat.	2	1	2
6816	3	Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, ”I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.” @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn’t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.”Ironic  twist.”	3	3	3
6818	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.	3	2	3
6819	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The bumpy roads. Sand in the eyes, thirst hit him too hot and humid tempures. Maybe he got tired of pedaling had to walk. A wild dog chased him went he got in town. Had no money to buy a drink	1	1	1
6825	3	Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don’t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.	3	1	3
6832	3	In the short story, Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in the story. For example, the dry hot air begins to  slowly dehidrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat also played tricks on his mind. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply. The setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist. 	2	2	2
6853	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, “a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved.	3	2	3
6859	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn’t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.	2	1	2
6863	3	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is “ I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is.” I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.  	3	2	3
6869	3	"It is my hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired and lack of water. “I checked my water supply and heated on” is a good example oF this. There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house he says “If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I’ll be alright"".This is how I know the setting and features in the setting is affecting the cyclists mentally and physically."	1	1	1
6881	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he’s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June. This shows the author is probably very hot. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the “towns” he came to were abandoned and uncared for. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would be able to get water for his trip.	2	2	2
6913	3	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.” he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didn’t have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going.	2	2	2
6926	3	”Do not Exceed the posted speed limit” tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of “the serenity of an early summer evening,” and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the “town” he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist’s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3	3
6928	3	The features of the setting affect. Any cyclist   because with the cyclist passed many time in the bicycle had problem on his/her back  when he/she will be older. When they will be a older person and they had passed many time in the bicycle, they will had a serious problems and also they will can not walk  more.	0	0	0
6931	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3	3
6932	3	"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph. the heat made his dehydration situation much worse.  “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, it would not have made sence. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation."	2	2	2
6935	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected he cyclist because first of all he lisined to old fowks that hav’nt left their front porch in about ten years. Then he didn’t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.	2	1	2
6947	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didnt give the boy advice then he probably wouldnt have run into all the trouble he ran into. At the same time the boy made his way to were he was going. Next time though he will just use his map so he dont have to go through the scare of death again.	1	1	1
6948	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the road’s condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road.	1	1	1
6978	3	The futures of the setting affect the cyclist was that he show the maD to other people and he shouldn’t (ister) to others where he had it to go.	1	1	1
6983	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads and also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator.	1	1	1
6990	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.	1	1	1
6998	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared.	1	1	1
6999	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about I thing winning!	1	1	1
7005	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1	1
7023	3	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake” This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1	1
7024	3	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     	0	0	0
7029	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles “battery acid.” The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature @NUM1 the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.	2	2	2
7037	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists.	1	1	1
7038	3	“There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. “I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.	1	2	2
7045	3	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through.	1	1	1
7055	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down.	1	1	1
7058	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1	1
7064	3	The desert area of California was makeing him dehydrated. The trip was long but he had enough water to get him there only if he took the maps way. The old men thot “haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office” told him a shortcut that he followed and ended up almost killing him due to heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have followed the map he could have stoped off at a store for more water if the setting was that bad.	1	1	1
7082	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist	3	2	3
7090	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist don’t find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.	1	1	1
7094	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example “One long, crippling hill” I can picture it in my head. “There was no one in sight.” All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help.	1	1	1
7098	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do.	2	2	2
7101	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn’t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1	1
7103	3	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn’t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would’ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don’t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart.	1	2	2
7124	3	"At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and the features of his environment. He says, “I enjoyed the seranety of an early- summer evening.” At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says. “this sight was trowoling”. The cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town. “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of his journey affects him the most. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist."	2	3	3
7126	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.” So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn’t help him much.  	3	2	3
7138	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surrounding it was hot so he got dehydrated more and needed more water. There were a lot of hills so he had to pedal harder and use more energy to get up the hills. There were no cars, building, smog, just nature. It was peaceful and relaxful ride on the bike thats the setting affects the cyclist.	1	1	1
7147	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2	3
7149	3	In the short story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need the cyclist says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.” The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, “And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people’s sense of directions.	3	3	3
7151	3	The setting in the story was the “high deserts of California in June.” At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn’t make it he saw a sign that said “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp” He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” So this brought self doubting behavior. 	3	3	3
7154	3	"The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, “I tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip."	3	3	3
7158	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The rider didn’t think he would live “I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean” but he found a place to get water “drank deeply from the sink” and finished his ride."	2	2	2
7159	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn’t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3	3
7175	3	The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks in the road, and also rough road. In the story “@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit the rider runs into” a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road	2	2	2
7188	3	According to the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot.	3	2	3
7197	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won’t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. 	2	3	3
7201	3	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert following outdated directions nearly got him killed. He also came across several broken down factories and towns causing more dismay. However he came across a last stop that saved his life.	1	1	1
7209	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the “short cut” that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive.	3	2	3
7211	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn’t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn’t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn’t see anything in sight.	3	3	3
7221	3	The setting sffects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people that most be the best mood nice and colun no cars and just him and the beautiful sky to ride with, like if there is infrastructure he must have to watch for people, cars and just have to day to streetsigns and act. So thats outing  the feature of the setting would affect the cyclsit.	1	1	1
7235	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says “the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and then it goes on to say, “I could drop from from a heat stroke.” This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat.	2	1	2
7241	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the welches grape factory. The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him relise that he was dehydrated. And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood.	2	2	2
7263	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. With all this being the “high deserts of California in June.” With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated saying “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"" shaving his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink he stated “I had an overwhelming and buy some bait” showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water."	2	2	2
7271	3	In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” the settings of the story affect the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him worried. In the story the cyclist takes two old men’s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountin and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn’t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die.	3	2	3
7284	3	"In this story the cyclest was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained of boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle. This was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways."	3	2	3
7287	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke.	2	2	2
7288	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY DEPLETING HIS WATER SUPPLY, AND ALMOST GIVING HIM HEAT EXHAUSTION. IN THE TEXT, HE SAYS: THE WATER BOTTLES CONTAINED ONLY A FEW TANTALIZING SIPS.” THIS HOTNES HE HAS LITTLE WATER LEFT FOR SURVIVAL UNTIL HE RUNS OUT.	1	1	1
7291	3	"The setting in “Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake “a ridiculously large"" snake – it realy didn’t look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me “(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."	2	2	2
7295	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men’s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best.	3	3	3
7311	3	In the short story, “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey.	1	1	1
7312	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are “the cool pines and rushing rivers” they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone. The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker.	2	1	2
7339	3	The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, ”At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest.	2	2	2
7373	3	"The cyclist a had rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says,""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. ""This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirster. ""@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. ""It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This show you now rough the conditions were because he told us in the begining that he is a cyclist. The biker hell a very rough time and the setting definity effects this. "	2	3	3
7376	3	Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesn’t have good water, “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid“ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, “in my dehydrated state“ (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him.	2	2	2
7380	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off – road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story “Do Exceed posted Speed Limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, “I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state” (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.	2	2	2
7381	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he’d not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.	3	3	3
7391	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain. The heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed that every where he would go, he couldn’t find anything, no buildings or people until he got that one town. In the story, “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist qoutes.“At same point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” @CAPS1 your bike on the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing  harsher conditions can only give you no hope .He soon almost ran out of water only made things worst.The sun beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him also, so with the cyclist , settings had alot to do with his journey.	3	3	3
7407	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. “The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I’m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.” That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. “With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author’s “Short, rolling hills”, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I’m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    	3	3	3
7421	3	"The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert. This made him thirsties and less active. The story says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt."""	1	1	1
7450	3	The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. “I hung my head,” means that he was depressed. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking @CAPS1.	2	2	2
7456	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch’s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, “with all my strength.” @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because “it had the flavor of battery acid.” Next, the Welch’s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of “a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice”, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2’s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle.” He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."	3	3	3
7459	3	The cyclist is most affected by e heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him.	1	1	1
7471	3	Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sence, like if it’s a sad story and it’s a ugly rainy day then it will match verry nice. That’s how the setting makes it better.	1	1	1
7477	3	In the story “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,” The setting is a long road with “no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind he cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he have to ride down.	1	1	1
7485	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” For example, he finds a “ramshackle shed” and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.	1	1	1
7488	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen.” This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping sweat from his eyes. 	1	1	1
7498	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is tRying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiRing. Also, the hot aiR can dehydRate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dRy aiR, theRe is dRy land, which means theRe is no place to stop foR wateR oR take a @CAPS1. The Rough @CAPS2 make the biking naRaeR because it involves moRe eneRgy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the  middle of the Road made it haved foR the bikeR to go aRound. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died fRom poison.	2	2	2
7511	3	The setting affects the cyclist by wanting to go longer and riding the bike. And to see what is up ahead. By riding a bike in the heat, you can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the heat. That’s why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike.	1	1	1
7513	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 	3	2	3
7531	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."	1	1	1
7539	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2”. This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. He said “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. "	3	2	3
7545	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down."	3	3	3
7546	3	The desert is the crulest of nature’s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. “As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear”.	3	2	3
7549	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	1	1	1
7550	3	This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster. Also fones are scarce. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, “the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage.	1	1	1
7555	3	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.	1	1	1
7566	3	On the way to @CAPS1 the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. This was making him tired and dehydrated. Half way throgh his journey he couldn't see anything for miles. That must of been discouraging. All the way there he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the heat.	1	1	1
7569	3	"The features of the setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job alot harder. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope."	2	2	2
7599	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)”. The hotness and heat had also increased the character’s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."	3	3	3
7603	3	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things.	1	1	1
7607	3	There are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. The narriation says, “and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became, bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either. So he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder. In the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.	2	2	2
7619	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, “This sight was troubling…I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.” With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called “easy way out.” 	1	1	1
7620	3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at body and wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town. As he pedal on “ The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it“. At that time the wheater is affecting him a lot but he keeps Yosemite cool pines and rushing rivers in his head He also only had only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill.	2	1	3
7625	3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path” it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is deserted. Also, when the author writes” the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” and when he writes “a ridiculously large snake” show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could get a tany time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die. Lastly, the name of the store is revelant because it is a fish bait store and he is thirsty. This is revelant because fish live in water and he is thirsty and seeing the sign relieves him completely. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	2	3
7638	3	In the essay ”Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist’s determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself.	2	1	2
7640	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn’t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to “set in”. The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated.	1	2	2
7643	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can’t go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him.	2	2	2
7649	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled “ I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ” This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said “ if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.”  	2	1	2
7667	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times.	1	2	2
7668	3	Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. “The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down.	1	1	1
7670	3	A response that explains how the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Would be that in the setting in the setting affected cyclist because for one the features of setting was based on something else. So that would be a reason how it would be affected. Because they're is differences in the stories.	0	0	0
7674	3	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.	1	2	2
7685	3	The cyclist is alone traveling on a flat land at first following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. During his travels he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with othe sun beating down on him in such hot weather of June, he realizes he could get a heart stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely and when he finally sees building which are realy ghost towns he recovers and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a camp site to save him from passing out in a desert where he could rest, get water, then carry on his journey using his own map.	3	2	3
7687	3	The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. “over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.” The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me.	2	3	3
7699	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn’t have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch’s Grape Juice Factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a “young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth” This make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.	1	1	1
7703	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the “… high   deserts of California… “   (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills “   (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a   “… long, crippling hill… “ (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
8871	4	The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.	1	1	1
8878	4	He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her up coming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place as she is and they can relate to somethings.	1	1	1
8891	4	By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says” when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,”she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. 	3	3	3
8896	4	The auther concludes with that paragraph because. it shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam. The reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The auther chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng’s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome he obstacles and be hopeful of the future.	2	2	2
8909	4	"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate like they had started over. So the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself. She sounds certain she sounds as if she want to start over because she says ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. To me she sounds like a brand new person. Who has forgotten about the past."	1	2	2
8935	4	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, @PERSON1 talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew, when saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says,”I will take the test again,” it shows that Saeng is willing try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping trditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like.	2	2	2
8939	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has found from hibiscus plant. Like the  plant Saeng is going to overcome an obstacle. She will try the driving test again and the plant will overcome. The harsh   ,blutal winter months. The plant will bloom in the spring and show its restrency during adversity. Saeng   will also overcome the  adversity  she faced when failed her driving test and realizing how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense will bloom in the spring. The winter, representing her despise  and homesickness, will not present her from living happly and taking the test over.The hibiscus reminds her of the. The story ends with the paragraph to show how the “ Winter Hibiscus” has taught her something about overcoming obstacles.	3	2	3
8941	4	The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are a like and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng’s obstacle is adjusting to her new life and the first step in that is passing her driver’s test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother , “I-I failed the @NUM1]. The hibiscus must make it through the winter, it also has to adjust to new surrounding to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng,”… but its strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus.Thats what matter “[@NUM2]. So,if the winter hibiscus’ job, or hurdle that it has to jump,it to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, “… in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”[@NUM2]. If Saeng’s obstacle is completing, and passing the driver’s test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes it’s “test” , the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirits to adopt, will grow deeper because that will adopt and pass their obstacle at the same time.	3	3	3
8953	4	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is remeniscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is  	1	1	1
8969	4	Hope, positivness, helpful all are reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives the readers a sense that Saeng has hope. I felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again. Since she is going to take the test again she wants to  help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So she is re-taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful.	2	2	2
8971	4	I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, ”When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. 	1	1	1
8981	4	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life.   	3	3	3
8983	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the story with the quote ""when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother ""comes back"" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again."	2	2	2
8993	4	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait untill winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning. She wants to try again because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants. Saeng wants to become a gardener like her mother.	0	0	0
9014	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she wants to show that after everything that happened, saeng will move on and try hard. For example, when she said, “When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” By ending the story like this, it leaves the reader in suspense because they do not know if the geese will return. The author seems to be showing the reader that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it like her old one. For example, when the mother said, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is, she will be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment.   	2	2	2
9025	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 she is detarmand to pass that test and is not going to give up until she passes it.	1	1	1
9029	4	The author concludes the ending as “I will take that test again” meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” she is thinking of the feature and how she “saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She can’t wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come.	2	2	2
9030	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.	0	0	0
9031	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sence of similarity to the character meaning no matter how out of place you feel its always something you can relate to	1	1	1
9036	4	"I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geess and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is that because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school. I think thats the reason."	0	0	0
9039	4	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, “I will take that test again.” By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn’t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, “when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way.	2	2	2
9060	4	In the story “ Winter Hibiscus “ Saeng vowes to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding. then I will take the test again. The author concludes   with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence. “Almost  familiar to her now.” This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her relize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclution the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the  girls memory of where she used to live.	2	3	3
9074	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. While reading you will find that Saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. In the story the author writes, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.” The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her. She then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once “this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test again” because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move. It is giving her motivation to once again take the driver’s test, and it is also letting the reader know that Saeng is not giving up.	3	2	3
9084	4	The author ended the story with that because she is sad and she wants to give hope to the reader that you should never give up on any thing, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note, if was like I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying that would not be good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail. Also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion that ending for story has a good choose for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader couage to never give up, end to practice something if you fail it the first time. Also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant,	2	2	2
9092	4	What l think the author was talking abount snow and it was add outside for the bays matter and snow started to melted.	0	0	0
9124	4	well It seems like to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because basically to have sarcaism and put emphesis on what he was saying and making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if some one would haft to kill him in order to make him take that test again.	0	0	0
9128	4	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."	1	1	1
9140	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died but winter is over in spring is here it’s her chance to get that flower. For example in the story it says Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. It’s not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds. The concludes because it will be a next time when you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand.	0	0	0
9144	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her. ” Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.	1	1	1
9145	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""I’d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."	1	2	2
9146	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way.	1	1	1
9168	4	The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.” This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation.	2	1	2
9200	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. 	1	1	1
9214	4	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, to show that even though she failed her test she isn’t giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saeng’s heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.	1	1	1
9217	4	The author of the story “winter Hibiscus”, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, “When they come back…in the spring… then I will take that test again”.(No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move on in the spring. It also shows that Saeng could overcome failing the test. The narrative also states,”…in the spring…when…this hibiscus is budding…”(No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life. Saeng is also starting fresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adopt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant. The hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times. The geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptations. 	2	3	3
9229	4	In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says “but its strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong.	2	2	2
9232	4	In the story “winter Hibiscus“ by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life but she failed. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again when the plant is in bloom.	1	1	1
9234	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, the hibiscus is budding. she will take the test. I think that the author conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to test them again.	0	0	0
9243	4	The concludes the sentence this way because their trying to show that Saeng is a very deterimined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that’s what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was.	2	2	2
9249	4	The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better.	2	2	2
9256	4	The author ends the story like this in comparing to adapting changing or doing everything all over again for example; The geese fly  away when it gets cold but they always  come back giving their home another  chance .The Hibiscus is another  fine example , it buds  in  @DATE1  always  but  doesn’t  die  in  winter.  It always  returns . Saeng  has obviously realized  this  and vowed to  try her  drivers  test  again because it might work  this time . The author was trying to get the message spread of ,” don’t  give  up.”	1	2	2
9257	4	Determination, help, strength – all are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a @CAPS1 why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her drivers test the frst time and she wants to wait and do it again. Shes determinated to take different steps in order to pass the test. Secondly, I beleieve that help is a @CAPS1 why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that she’ll go back and she’ll be ready. Finally, strength is the last @CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng beleieves that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and she’ll be stranger than she was before. These are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	3	2	3
9261	4	The Author concludes this story with that paragraph because she is saying that she could not concentrate on the test because she wanted to go back to her home country.	1	1	1
9268	4	The reason why he concludes this with this paragraph is because he is telling how the story ends. The reason behind that is so people know's what happens.	0	0	0
9280	4	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe it’s because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.	1	1	1
9282	4	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way.	2	1	2
9300	4	The author ended this story with this paragraph because thats now Saeng felt. She felt connteced  to the geese  and the hibiscus ,” She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive was etched ,”  “ almost familiar to her now ,” She will retake the test in the spring . The hibiscus and the flower will make he feel better in the spring . she should pass the test.	1	1	1
9304	4	The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test.	2	3	3
9334	4	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more intrested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year. 	1	1	1
9364	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" I believe they end the story the way they did, “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because with saeng making a goal, she’s overcoming her disappointment and uncomfort living in a new country. The archetyple meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new, growth. This shows he growing and that’s important in life and that’s why the ended it the way they did. It’s a positive ending."	2	2	2
9378	4	The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, as the hibiscus will through winter. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.	1	1	1
9379	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “I choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do.	2	1	2
9399	4	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.	2	2	2
9430	4	"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng’s mother states, ""…it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months…. That’s what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months."	2	3	3
9431	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories have read this is used. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book it always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you don’t find out by who until the next book.	1	1	1
9438	4	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home.	3	2	3
9449	4	"I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. ""(Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying.” then I will take the test again.” (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly. so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determing to succeed. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined."	1	2	2
9464	4	I think the author add this paragraph because it a sign of a new start for her. Because she has hard time no doesn’t main the she will alway have hard times.	0	0	0
9476	4	"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. “I will  take that test again,” This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote,” when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return,” is referring to when she says,” She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become … almost familiar to her. Like the geese,” She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter.” When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country.” When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center –just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying  that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return meaning in the @DATE1 then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass."	1	2	2
9488	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again. 	0	0	0
9489	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng’s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn’t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says “will take that test again”she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.	2	2	2
9504	4	The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will be strong too. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings. She is setting a real goal for herself. Saeng is identifieng with the flower. It gives her comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother.	1	2	2
9519	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It means she’ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she’s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it.	1	1	1
9522	4	The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying till she got it right. No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway. It certainly woked out of place, but it would do anything to survive. Being strong at times when you can only depend on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined from her loss and the perfection of the Hibiscus flower.	2	2	2
9540	4	The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.	0	0	0
9570	4	The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.	2	2	2
9572	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1	1
9579	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” so that the audience has something to think about, it gives the story a little more of a dramatic effect.	0	0	0
9581	4	The author concluded the story with this sentence because shes letting people know that she enjoys nature more than school.	0	0	0
9590	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.	1	2	2
9599	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. When it says “ saeng vowed silently to herself she thought about everything and the phrase is almost like she is going to start over.	1	1	1
9602	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.	1	1	1
9609	4	when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph “when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”	0	0	0
9612	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.	0	0	0
9613	4	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2	2
9628	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.	2	1	2
9650	4	"At the end of the short start “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng says “when they comeback, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" When she says this she is refering to her drivers test she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didnt give up they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start “plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. “She sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before. So she wont now other.  "	2	2	2
9658	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and solves the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said ""… I will take that test again"" it showed that she is determined to pass the tes and will try again. Since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also incorporates Saeng difficultly to that geese because just as geese faces hardships getting her driver lisense. But also like the geese she will go back her face hardships again. "	1	2	2
9661	4	She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way.	1	1	1
9664	4	The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year.	0	0	0
9689	4	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.	1	2	2
9690	4	Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story. Shes trying to say that when the time is right she will try it again untill she gets it right. Without this last paragraph you wouldn't be able to understand the message of the story.	0	0	0
9708	4	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, “in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author’s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.	2	2	2
9715	4	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, with the strong paragraph of one sentence starting that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng’s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs.	3	2	3
9718	4	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome.	1	1	1
9721	4	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.	1	1	1
9723	4	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and new beginnig for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past, that she didn’t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying “live in the moment”. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that’s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough."	3	2	3
9741	4	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the “winter hibiscus” reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driver’s test again in the spring. 	2	3	3
9754	4	At the end of the essay “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.	2	1	2
9767	4	Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized – all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.	2	1	2
9769	4	I think he did because he wanted to show how he loved everything in life.	0	0	0
9808	4	The author’s choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe sent of let the reade knew that the story continues. But, I think that the test is that to remind her of home.	1	1	1
9809	4	The Author @CAPS1 the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She @CAPS1 it with this because she begins the story with Saeng Failing Her Driver license test. and also she was think that the Winter Hibiscus was good luck after it goes away and how she & fimerlary with @CAPS3 which would be the geese she put @CAPS3 together and thats why she said when the geese comes back and the snow melts......That is why she said it.  	1	1	1
9826	4	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng’s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom’s gardening, she says, “Here, let me help, mother,” because her mom’s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, “Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye,” which shows Saeng’s concern for her mother’s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, “It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,” which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng’s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story’s conclusion.	1	1	1
9833	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. “The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. “Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.” When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.	3	2	3
9847	4	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile… That atleast, she could hold onto.” After failing her driver’s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must “blossom” in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground.	3	3	3
9853	4	"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she don’t fail at doing so. For example, ""Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue.”"	1	0	1
9856	4	The author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic. When the Geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning. When the Hibiscus is budding it has a new life. When all this happens Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some. It makes you wanting more, knowing she failed her test you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, @CAPS1 a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around when the hibiscus blooms it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections w/her past and comfort during hard times. The Hibiscus symbolizes all this	3	2	3
9871	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brufield or the  author never  wanted to be around while the cold was in sesion. At the  time it was realy cold	0	0	0
9900	4	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she’s showing she is trying she wants another chance. She realized her mistake’s and ready to start over, Even though she faild by trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter she is trying to start over when the @DATE1 comes in. for example in the story. It stated the ""winter hibiscus"" was in the ground now, and saeng tamped down the soil around it over head, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes familiar to saeng snow. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1	1
9904	4	"In the last paragraphy the reason why the author uses ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test. The author uses this because Saeng finally had found comfort. after  moving from a her homeland veelnam to the united States, she felt home sick. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remember he grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and @CAPS1 got a sense of relief. Thats why she vowed that when winter was oven and spring came she would take that test, because she had a sense of home in her, that gave her uncouragement and strength. it also shows that even when your are in a different area and you are chew, there's always something that can male you remember the unemove and lime spent where you can from"	2	2	2
9915	4	The author @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because of the titel and the begening of the story. Or he @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because he wants to. He @MONTH1 have concluded the story like that to show what @MONTH1 happen. But is good conclusion is a good conclusion. 	0	0	0
9929	4	This final paragraph goes along with one of the main premises of the story. To not quite and keep going in order to understand and be happy in this world. Saeng is taking this “test” to see if shes ready to change and adapt to her new environment. She failed this time. But when all is right and the hibiscus is ready she will try again to see if shes ready to let go of the old and be happy with the new.	1	1	1
9932	4	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.	1	2	2
9953	4	"I believe the author concluded the story with “When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better. "	2	2	2
9955	4	The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start and it will be spring and beautiful. “@CAPS1 plant  it right now” is telling me that she wants another try. She wants a fresh strart and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are bloming and geting there chance she wants her now chance to pass best.	0	0	0
9964	4	The last line is included in the story “Winter Hibiscus” because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.	2	3	3
9967	4	The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she’ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , “a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng ‘s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.	3	3	3
9989	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng  relatestnct  she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to then she @MONTH1 be able to pass the test.	1	1	1
9995	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph taking the test again to show that the narrator @MONTH1 be upset about being in a new place but she will keep trying. The narrator gets upset when she knows the hibiscus is not like the one's from her old home. This upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before. The author uses that paragraph to show the narrator is strong and won’t give up on making things the way they were but also showing that she'll try to adapt to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding. So the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up.	2	2	2
9998	4	When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased	0	0	0
10008	4	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.	1	1	1
10014	4	The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.	0	0	0
10022	4	She see if her plant will survive then the winter just like the ones back at home.. And she things will be the. Same.	1	1	1
10039	4	I believe the author adds this passage to the Story to represent determination and @LOCATION1. While Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2 she is determined and willing to try and. adapt to our @CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the Spring will Bring foregiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will try to pass the driving test again to further herself into american @CAPS1, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her @CAPS4 to home.	2	2	2
10046	4	The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over.	1	1	1
10058	4	In the story “winter hibiscus” by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite & they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you don’t know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isn’t gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says “when they come back then I will take the test again,“ that’s showing she isn’t giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it.	1	1	1
10061	4	The author concludes the story with  the last paragraph of the story. When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibisous is budding, their i will take that test again.	0	0	0
10071	4	When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year. She means trying to plant the plants all over again. When Saeng says “Here, let me help, mother. Right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all.	0	0	0
10073	4	The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test.	1	1	1
10075	4	"Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything was unfamiliar to her, so she failed, but on her way back something familiar found her. Native plants of her home. “There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom, "" "" "" “floating in the bucket.” Saeng needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees the geese, and this symbolizes change. “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.” Spring is a time for new beginnings, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” When the familiar object is at it's best, she will be her best and be able to face anything. Winter is the “getting-ready” stage."	2	2	2
10090	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels.	3	2	3
10092	4	“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.	3	3	3
10121	4	I believe the author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus”, written by Minfong Ho, with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up.	2	3	3
10141	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph To show the final determination and strength Saeng has been given. It’s almost as though it’s taken this plant To show her to get back up and pass the Test. The plant becomes a comporting item that reminds her of her homeland. She returned with the plant To show her mother but found herself too shaky to even say the words “at home"". This shows how much she misses home. But she is able to realize that this is her new home and everything is becoming more familiar To her. "	2	2	2
10158	4	"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both @CAPS1 is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home oF Vietnam very much. However, both oF them must and will adOpt to their new environments.."	3	2	3
10172	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng won’t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you. Saeng struggled to get out “I-I failed the test” and couldn’t say “at home” this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.	2	2	2
10186	4	What the author is talking about is that the snow was melting and the spring is coming. I guess what they mean is that flowers, trees and grass are going back beautiful. Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that is not winter nomore. Thats why she start to plant plants in the winter. So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should of add more to the paragraph like how the plants and stuff was growing so beautiful. He shouldn't add more details to let us know, what was talking about in this paragraph.	0	0	0
10194	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in @LOCATION1 now."	0	1	1
10195	4	In the story “Winter @CAPS1” the author was trying to saying that Saeng was from somewhere then where he is now. In the text It say’s “It was like walking into another world so he is there thinking like no boby know him except for him and him only.	0	0	0
10206	4	The reason why the aurthor wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story. Another reason why she/@CAPS1 put that in the story; @CAPS2/@CAPS3 it is letting the reader know that plant will never give up.	0	0	0
10209	4	It shows in this time of doubt that she will overcome. In the story the plant showed hope and in showing this gave her hope. All the memories that she recalled had made her sad at first but in the end gave her hope.	1	1	1
10261	4	The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.	1	1	1
10264	4	The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough to make it through the winter. That’s what matters. “Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they “died” as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.	3	3	3
10267	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement that Saeng vowed silently to herself. Saeng says she will take the test again referring to the drivers test. Seeing the geese flying in a “V” and seeing the hibiscus gave Saeng a sense of remembrance to her homeland. Saeng misses he homeland. The author wanted it to seem to the @CAPS1 as if Saeng is starting to feel at home again. The hibiscus is just a symbol to Saeng telling her that It will be @CAPS2.K, and that it’s okay for her to miss Vietnam but also that it’s okay to have a new life, So Saeng, in the spring, will go take her drivers test again with a new attitude and will pass the test.	2	2	2
10274	4	"I @CAPS1 I @CAPS1 the author concludes the story with the paragraph saying that she’s going to take the test again, to show us that this time she’s goin to pass the test and she’s not going to feel the same way she felt when she didn’t pass. it tell us in “spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" because thats when she is going to take the test. "	1	1	1
10294	4	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn’t know if she will pass but she isn’t giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.  	1	1	1
10302	4	The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author I think ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing she is not going to give up. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you don’t. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually don’t want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.	2	2	2
10317	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try keep her next plant. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again because she sold the plant to somebody. Saeng has seed the plant before as a child and that's why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try and keep her next plant. 	1	1	1
10318	4	The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.	1	2	2
10320	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home. 	2	3	3
10340	4	The author concludes the paragraph with this paragraph because she wants to try again. The author is saying that the hibiscus she planted @DATE1 did not work and she is trying again this @DATE1 to grow a hibiscus plant. She will pass the test if she succeds in the spring. That is why the author concludes with this paragraph.	1	1	1
10342	4	She going to take the test agan @CAPS1 she feels like She needs to and She @CAPS2  when the snow melts and geese came back that means She wants to take the in the Spring. 	1	1	1
10347	4	"The Author concudes this story with paragraph because She loves her garden. She concudes it because the story is about then and their garden and it eventually turns cold leaving them nothing to do untill Spring. Itsuggest they have strong feelings For what they do as it says ""in In spring when the snow nelts and the gese return and this hibiscus budding"" hears she wants to take the tst to overcome and prove She can take care of her Garden."	0	0	0
10354	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, “When they come back…then I will take that test again.” She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.  	2	2	2
10356	4	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho. The author is stating that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and she finds peace with the plant because it brings back childhood memories. For example “And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton.” She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it remined her of grandmother. @CAPS1 might of experienced something like this. @CAPS1 might of wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that l touch or smell a sweater,it brings back memorises of my grandmother. I feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others	1	2	2
10357	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some some people vowed silently because the don’t want to express themselves. Also maybe because they are not very mistful of people even themself. One day I was  like that I didn’t want to talk to anybody. All I want to do is sit in my room and think. Think about my life were I am going to go after i die. I just woulnd sit in my room in the dark wondering if in my room in the dark wondering if I  would come back in another body or will my soul roam the earth. But think I starting think that I am a kid, I got a wonderful like a head of me. I when I get to the one where I need to think about then I would . So  I started talking to everybody again	0	0	0
10361	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope. The geese and the  hibiscus symbolize saeng’s determination, because they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test , just like the geese will also be back. The hibiscus also symbolize her because it has faced adversity also. It has been taken to new paces and had new homes, much like saeng , and has a harsh winter coming in the near future.  However , it  always  finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what saeng hopes to do by taking the driver’s test. The author included the last paragraph to show symbolism between saeng  ,the  geese , and the hibiscus.That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.    	3	3	3
10366	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. first, The test is important to Saeng so that she can prove to herself that she is able to pass it. Ending with this paragraph also gives the reader some suspense as to wheather Saeng will pass or even go to take the test again. Lastly, this paragraph shows Saeng’s personality traits. It shows that she is persistent, determined, and strong willed.	2	1	2
10373	4	I think author concludes the with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, he wants to show  us never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that’s why he ends like that.	1	1	1
10383	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph	1	1	1
10395	4	I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm. This is similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs tobe strong, to overcome winter, from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome it’s test, winter then she can survive to cangner her own.	2	3	3
10401	4	I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.	1	1	1
10420	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1	2
10433	4	The author used that sentence because the snow is melting and the geese are coming back. The flowers were budding up and that is why I think the author used that sentence. Scribed by @ORGANIZATION1	0	0	0
10448	4	I think the author concludes this story wit this ending paragraph because the story is all about how  she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese to come back to take her test. I think she wants to wait that way she will be more comfortable with her surroundings and she can clear her mind and do her best on the test.	1	1	1
10478	4	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe because its a good luck thing or its a tradition so its very important that its in the story. Also it could be trying to tell us something like she only take test in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding.	0	0	0
10486	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.	0	0	0
10489	4	I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful.	0	0	0
10491	4	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants.	1	2	2
10492	4	In the story winter Hibiscus they end the story with that paragaph, because it repents that she is geting use to the new contrury. She is also telling you that you need to a paped to newsra winds. That’s why I think they ened with that pargraph	1	1	1
10495	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test so over the winter they don’t get hibiscus but over the spring when they get again the hibiscus she will try to take the taste again so she can pass it	1	1	1
10521	4	The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test.	2	1	2
10528	4	The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey	2	1	2
10539	4	The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story we learn that the main character has failed her driver’s test. Also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, in which her mother is shocked about. The reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed. But because of her grandmother and her homeland she instead surprizes the reader by looking on the brightside of things and saying that when the flower blooms again she will take the test again. This shows the connection between the main character and the plant. Giving the plant a humanlike existence.	3	2	3
10540	4	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the oevrall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she truly shows her determination and how shes not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her. "	2	2	2
10550	4	The  author includes that sentence of the end of the story because through out the story it was showing  courage,and that explains her getting better and showing  courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test and not letting it get her down that she failed the first time.	1	1	1
10578	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and–yes–familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.	3	2	3
10597	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring that means that the plant is about to bloom. That also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again. Also the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can make it, then the girl can pass her drivers test and be happy both ways.	1	1	1
10601	4	The author concludes this story with the few words “then I will take that test again.” because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once. She is going to keep going until she succeeds with passing “the test.”	1	1	1
10610	4	"The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the motivational paragraph  because he/she wants to show the reeder that  Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome common  obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a hard time coping with her problem so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. I think that the line “and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles. The conclusion for the story is a nice ending."	2	2	2
10621	4	the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sounds like a interesiting ending paragraph that have something to do with the story	0	0	0
10622	4	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up. Just like the geese don’t give up flying back and forth ever winter and spring. 	1	1	1
10641	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn’t want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return. Also I think it wants to inform the reader about what Saeng was thinking.	0	0	0
11850	5	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the setting. Narciso describes his house and says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back-drop to life in our warm home."" The author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories. Anothe reason is how grateful the author sounds. It says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" While they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life. The author is happy that they did. Also, the author credits the house with giving him a family. @CAPS1 says, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of the word 'family.' And for this, I will be forever grateful."" @CAPS1 learned a lot in this house and is very happy for that. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir @CAPS1 creates a very happy mood."	4	4	4
11856	5	"In the memoir @PERSON1 it talks about making a house a home and a community, your family. ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (par @NUM1) paragraph @NUM1 goes onto talk about how growing up with Italian, Spanish, and Cuban cultures in one community, with all differences aside made the community into a family. Rodriguez talks very warmly, and with only good things to say about his childhood.the mood of the memoir is Rodriguez remembering his culture filled childhood. ""I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love"" (par seven) The memoir is a dedication to his life and a reflection of all the experiences had within his family. He writes his memoirs in loving spirits dedicating his knowledge of a ""family"" to his own."	4	3	4
11874	5	"In this excerpt from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a very clear mood in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez's ""eternally grateful for his family and everything they did for him. For example, ""[Narciso Rodriguez] will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 admires ""their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @PERSON1 feels that ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" @PERSON1 ""learned the real definition of 'family.'"" @PERSON1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""	3	3	3
11893	5	"The mood of the memoir by @PERSON1 is love and compassion for his parents. He tells how he grew up with pride for Cuba and how he still loves Cuban music. His parents gave him these qualities which he adores but he is ""eternally grateful for his rich culinary skills that were passed on to him by his parents. @PERSON1 also talked about the role of ""family"" in the environment in which he grew up in. In his neighborhood, many people were the victims of racism, so they all came together to be a stronger whole. By growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need. @PERSON1 also told the reader of the courage his parents had by leaving everything they knew and loved behind and how he wished he could have that same courage, but at least he knew of it."	3	3	3
11895	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by himself he creates a tone of love. It is tone of love because he explains that his parents taught him many great things. Also that he is grateful and thankful to everything his parent's gave him, as it says in paragraph @NUM1. For example he explains that family doesn't have to be blood related. His parents taught him that anybody you can trust his family, anybody that you help because you know they will do the same for you. Also in the last sentence it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". So the author's tone for his memoir is love and that he is grateful for everything with his parents."	2	3	3
11913	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creats a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time. It is sad because the parents had to leave all of their family, friends, and careers back in Cuba, while coming to @LOCATION1 not Knowing the language. He didn't even get to meet his real grand parents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child. He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends."	2	2	2
11932	5	"The way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. He had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author."	4	4	4
11934	5	Narciso was very proud of his cuban culture. He was very happy with who he had become, and how he had been raised. Narciso set a very proud and greatful tone to this memoir. He explains that family isnt about blood relations; its about people who love eachother, and are going to be there for eachother. He told us that his parents passed on the cuban culture to him, in cooking. He also explained how his parents built the home on their own, that he got to grow up in. Narciso says how proud he is to be a cuban, and how his family works @CAPS1 hard to earn a living. Narciso told us how proud and happy he was, to be in a nice home, with friends, family, and a future. He told us he learned to love.	3	3	3
11959	5	"The mood in the memoir is happy. It is happy because it is a talking about Narciso's memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood is also appreciative. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" The mood is also sad. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. So there was several moods in this memoir."	2	2	2
11961	5	Happy. You should always be proud where you came from. Not only that back your background like your culture and your parents. Stuff like that. Never be ashamed about stuff like that even if your diffrent it shouldn't matter. The more diffrent you're the more unique you're.  Just look at it that way. Plus you should never change just because of what you're and what you look like. 	1	0	1
11966	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is in the following. In the first paragraph, it descripes a couple coming to @LOCATION2 from Cuba who settles down and has a baby. Within the story, it describes their life here in @LOCATION2, what their house is like and the importance of cooking and music from Cuba. In Newark, New Jersey this family invites friends and family for dinner and such; the author describes how it brought everyone together and the mood of unity and happiness. The mood of this memoir is happiness and unity which was created by the author.	2	2	1
11973	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood, that is overall cheerful, warm, and happy. He does this through his word choice. ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cookig that is still with me today."" (par @NUM1). He decribes his parents cooking skills as ""rich"" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. ""all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people. Another example is when he says, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love."" (par. @NUM3). You can feel the warmth of the room with the adjectives he uses. This is how the author creates the mood in the story."	2	4	2
11996	5	"In this excerpt from the book ""Home: the blue prints of our lives"" Narciso Rodriguez describes his first home in @LOCATION1. The feeling of this story is first loving with how @CAPS1 explains his parents sacrifice ""they-came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This story also gave a feeling of closeness and how ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative' @CAPS1 and his family opened up there house to many people. This story also gave a warm feeling by the story of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven. Overall the story had a happy mood to it showing love, kindness, and what a family should be like"	2	2	2
11998	5	The mood that the author created was happy. All the people in the story were happy and some what sad.	0	1	1
12000	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives mood created is described. The starting evidence found in the memior is. ""my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" The mood being created is detirmenation. The parents were determined to make it to the United States because that was hard to do. But the parents did make it to the United States. The other piece of evidence found is ""in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two-family, blonde-brick building in the @CAPS1 bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" The mood being created is happiness and sadness. There is happiness because he was just born. The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they live in a two-family house. This is the moods created in the memior."	2	2	2
12006	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy because he talks about things that happened to his parents and happy things of his parents. I think the author is sad because they died but he could be happy too. I think I would be sad and happy if my parents died. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy. My Parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the united states in 1956. In 1961, I was born into this simple house. I think he was happy where he was born.	1	1	1
12011	5	"The moods created by the author in the memoir is happiness, love, and gratitude To start, it made me feel happy because of  the way he described his house, and how delightful it was. ""cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..."" I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to take their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them. Finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family, and friends. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would be grateful also. That is how this memoir makes me feel once I read it."	3	3	3
12017	5	The author created a calm mood. Everything he talks about is in the same tone. When he talks about the kitchen in his home, he also created a happy mood. He was calm while talking about the memories in his old home. He stayed calm when he talked about how caring his parents were. Overall, the whole writing is in a calm mood.	1	1	1
12032	5	the @CAPS1 that the author created in the memoir was an uplifting one. His memoir talked about growing up in the gattr of Newark, New Jersey (which became more of a ghetto), during the time of immigration. His neighborhood was full of Spanish, @PERSON1, and Italian immigrants. His family would come over and they would have dinner together, and they would have people stay in their house until they got back on their feet. He had a childhood full of family and friendship. which is great to have.	1	1	1
12055	5	"In the memoir the mood that the author created is the memoir can be @CAPS1 in two ways. first was happy for being created and being able to use america's beautifulfriendlyness. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to a blood relative."" @CAPS2 was that knowing that if you have hope anything can be achived. ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	2	2
12071	5	"The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefullness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times. Like on paragraph @NUM1. It says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" @CAPS1 all of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents. So, the mood @CAPS1 in the memoir was love, towards his parents. "	3	3	3
12072	5	"In the non--fiction memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about his life growing up, his home, and the people around him. The author considered his neighbors family also, rather than just his parents and brothers and sisters. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... a close knit community."" (par @NUM1) This gives the memoir a friendly mood, it shows that the author loved his whole neighborhood. The author also invited his neighbors into his home and was very close to them. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table... more often than not. Also at the table... my surrogate grandparents."" (par @NUM2) This gives the memoir an inviting mood, the author always had friends and neighbors over for dinner. The author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (par @NUM3) this gives the memoir a sweet mood, the author shows his happiness and gratefulness for everything his parents had done for him. In conclusion the authors  sets a very sweet, inviting mood, by adding details of how joyful, and enjoyable his childhood was."	3	4	4
12073	5	The mood the auther has is good. He's very proud of how he lives. The most thing that matters in his life are family. His family cares alot and watch over him no matter what and he is very thankful for all.	1	2	2
12078	5	"The mood of the author in the memoir is very happy. I think it sounds like the child of the greatful family is talking and she is one of the most greatful people I ever read about because she says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home""."	1	1	1
12083	5	The @CAPS1 the author created is sentimental, sad but happy at the same time. I think the @CAPS1 is mostly sentimental because the family moves to @LOCATION1 and kind of looks back to good memories that happend in cuba.	0	1	1
12093	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love."	2	2	2
12119	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by The Blueprints of Our lives, the mood created by the author is happyness.The mood in the memoir was happyness. It because the mother showed he how to love people. Quote she said... Always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love. It was there I learned the real difinition of ""family."" That many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative. I like when her mom let anybody to there household to the table.In the mood that created by the author is happyness in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."	2	2	2
12127	5	"The author created a mood that showe his true love for his family and his home by explaining his culture, his family, and how grateful he is to his parents. He starts by going into detail about his culture of ""Rich culinary skills....a love of cooking....passionate cuban musci (which I adore to this day)"" it builds a base to this mood by showing that his home was always filled with the food and arts of his heritage.  He goies on to talk about his family, which ""had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" he explained how his true family was of many many cultures that ""came together in great solidarily and friendship.  ""@CAPS1, he thanks his parents for everything they did for him by moving to @LOCATION1 and for showing him how important family and friends are.  ""i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home.""  That is the mood expressed by the quthor, through his culture, family, and by showing gratitude to his parents for giving him a basis for life. "	3	4	4
12129	5	The mood is very warm and welcoming. It starts off with a beautiful and culturally enriched apartment. Then talks about delicious foods and great music. But at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life.	1	2	2
12135	5	"The mood in the memoir given by the author makes me think of my home. Overall, it makes you feel warm or happy inside. In the second paragraph when he is explaining his house and the music playing it automatically makes me think of my house around the holidays; like when the music is playing and you sing along matter how bad you are. You can tell that this book gives the reader a very positive mood or good ""vibe""."	1	1	1
12146	5	The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching.	1	2	2
12150	5	The mood created by the author was to me appreshiation, and some sympathy. Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story.	2	3	3
12159	5	I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminisceance and hapiness. Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez talks about thankful he is his parents gave up so much to come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like. Lastly happiness which is mostly his mood when he remineses his past and family. Those are the moods of his meimor.	3	2	3
12165	5	the mood created by the author in the memoir was mutule in the begining it was about move to a New contrey they did seem faced by it they were more into giveing there child a better life and in the end it really sounds like they were all happy they welcomed people that moved from somwhere els into there home and welcomed them I think overall it was a happy mood that was created by the author	2	1	2
12171	5	The @CAPS1 is writing in first person narrative. The @CAPS2 sets a tone with and about How he is so proud of his cuban relationship and haritage. He is also very happy and proud about how he has great parents and a great house and very very fund memories of all these things. He also explains and talks about other people and how it was hard to leave cuba and come to america. That is how the @CAPS1 sets the tone for this story.	2	2	2
12209	5	The author was so thankful, they explained how they thank there parrents for moving here. And how a house can become a  home and how important family and friends relationships are	2	2	2
12220	5	The mood in the memoir is basicly showing love, happiness, and friendship. The way that the mood shows love is in @CAPS1 @NUM1 and @NUM2. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 is says Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it talks about how his parent welcome refugees to celebrate their arrival to @LOCATION1. Happiness was shown throughout the story. And friendship was shown as well The way that friendship was shown by his parents keeping their door open to whom who did not have a home. But let them stay in their home until their back on he or she is back on there feet, and considerd part of the family.	2	2	2
12223	5	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get buy. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only defenition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey.	2	2	2
12224	5	"In the memoir, @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS3 is hard and happy.The first place in the story when the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they say that racism is overt. ""Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants overt racism"". this show that the mood is hard because we know that at that time racism was occurring so that made it hard for them to fit in with everybody else.The last place in the story were the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together. ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship"". This displays a happy mood because is represents a whole bunch of diffrent people comming together to work together.As you can see @CAPS3 creates two different types of moods hard, and happy."	3	2	3
12246	5	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love.	2	2	2
12282	5	"The mood of the author Narciso Rodriguez was he was always proud of his culture and mom and dad. For example in paragraph two it talks about @CAPS1 where he lived and how he said that he ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"". ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). In the story @PERSON2 always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile. And he was positive and honest. And he even talked about his community ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" And Narciso also said ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."""	3	3	3
12327	5	"This memoir definatley has a strong and apperent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, he is obiously very thankfull to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" This quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankfull for his parent's love for him.This mood comes out in the memoir when @PERSON2 says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are."" This quote shows how he is thankfull for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a person.In all, There are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being gratefull."	3	3	3
12356	5	The authors @CAPS1 was good because the story is kind of happyness.	1	1	1
12357	5	the mood in the memoir can be exaessed in many different ways. The memoir is mostly eprssed with gratitude from Narciso to his parents. He describes in good detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him. Leaving behind all their friends and family, the hot climate, and their cultures back in Cuba. Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were kind to everyone. They turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go. They had open dinner where friends and family members came. Even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him. What they did for him created the beautiful moods described in the memor.	2	3	3
12373	5	"What is a memoir? A memoir is of writing someone's own feelings and experiences during their life. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez tells of her life in her simple home in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout the memoir Rodriguez sits a distinct mood of love and care, which she learned from her parents back in her childhood. The mood is mainly set by the memories of her environment, friends, and culture. All of these things are described by Rodriguez to make you feel the mood she expresses. The mood of love and care is incorporated into the memories of her childhood, beginning from the time she was born. Rodriguez begins to draw the mood in paragraph two by describing her home that was made into a traditional Cuban home by her parents. She describes the ""rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music... And the congregation of family and friends."" @CAPS1, she begins to describe the love of her friends and neighbors, who she felt, were family. Last, Rodriguez describes the influence her Cuban culture has had on her. She talks about how her parents helped others of their kind which made her what she is today."	4	3	4
12401	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by The @CAPS1 prints of our Lives the mood in many thing. The mood is the feel of happiness in his house of his family shows him love and his culture and heritage. I think this becausein the story it say ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many thing I learned there. about how to love """	1	1	1
12403	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author created a mood. First of all in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says ""here the innocent of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, endless celebrations... That formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that the author was trying to convey a happy sort of mood the setting that they were surrounded with me that the foundation to their warm spirited home as it said ""the backdrop life of our warm home."" @CAPS1 it also has a homey feeling. Second of all it also says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This means that he felt he was close enough to everybody in his community it was like family. They were all each other had anything not matter where they came from. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength, and perseverance, and thank them repeatedly for that."" This means that the author is trying to convey is thanks and gratitude on who his parents made him. In conclusion the author created in mood through this memoir that family has many different meanings."	4	4	4
12407	5	"The author definatly created a mood when he wrote the memoir. The mood is love. All throughout the memoir, he talked about how his parents love of him had them leave their countries and come to the US. Because they loved him and wanted him to have a good life they left Cuba, everyone they knew and loved, the jobs they had, and started all over. Their families love turned the house into the home he loves. They brought the culture of Cuba into their new home with decorations and ""the very heart of which was the kitchen. The memoir's mood is the love of the author's parents to him."	2	2	2
12408	5	"Narciso Rodriguez, a clothing designer, wrote a memoir on his ideas about family. I believe the author set a very personal mood in this story. This is not unexpected considering it is a memoir however there were few statement facts and everything was personal experience. Along with personal the memoirs also show a very loving and happy lifestyle they lived. For example there was always Cuban music playing along with Cuban food and the parents would always host a person in the house is time to get back on their feet. Above all the author clearly shows his love for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" With this the author clearly shows the mood for love and happiness."	2	3	3
12415	5	"The author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives. The first and most dominant mood is a sense of family or friendship. The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close. Next the author installed a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from cuba into this three room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth. Finally the author gives us a Sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes...""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air..."" In these ways, the author reaches out to his readers with the mood of friendship, warmth, and culture to give us a taste of his life with his adoring parents in this small three room house he called home."	3	2	3
12416	5	"@ORGANIZATION1 creates a warm, comforting mood in a piece of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. He does this by explaining what goes on in a positive light. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congression of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm homes."" This quote uses words like celebrations and warm to show that this place was a comforting place that always had a great time. This shows how Narciso Rodriguez created this warm, comforting mood."""	2	2	2
12418	5	"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have."	2	2	2
12427	5	The author mood in the memoir sound gratefun and very happy. This @CAPS2 that he was greatful because Cuba music and he sound like love to write about his @CAPS1 life.

Another example was he felt warm because of that. He love what his parent's did.	1	2	2
12436	5	"The mood of this story is happy, hopful, and caring. In some paragraphs, the mood shifted and felt upsetting and gloomy (p @NUM1) ""They struggled both personally and financially."" At these parts in the memoir it felt sad and hopless to see what struggles they faced. But then it shifted. Narciso used words like, ""courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration."" This transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story. They never gave up hope and all the imagrents helped eachother with their problems. This is set a mood of selflessness, and caring which is what the Rodriguez family brought to the United States."	2	2	2
12450	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. It is a good mood and it also explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from cuba to the united States. It was a good mood because the parents of Narciso Rodriguez always let people who needed help in their home until they could get back on their feet, paragraph four. Their is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad always a good attitude. Narciso's parents let family and friends over for dinner all the time for cuban cooking and music. Every One has such a great attitudes. This selection has a soft, nice, and good mood.	3	2	3
12455	5	The author set a mood for this memoir. The mood he has set is love and kindness. The reason love and kindness is the mood because he says he loves his parents for self sacrifice so that he could grow up in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2.

12469	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is that hes glad to be born in @LOCATION1. He loves his parents for the sacrifice for making his life easier and better by moving to @ORGANIZATION1.	1	1	1
12478	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, a great mood is created by the author. This mood is unity. One reason why the mood is unity is because even while Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved from Cuba to the United States they stayed together. After they had first moved to the @LOCATION3 they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play. Another reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because, when the Rodriguez's were first living in the United States, the other immigrants in their neighborhood became family. And paragraph three it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A synonym for solidarity is unity, so here the author is even saying how his neighborhood all united into one big happy neighborhood. The final reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because even after all of these years, Rodriguez ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" To this day, his family is still united and they all still love each other. In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is unity throughout Rodriguez's and his family's whole story."	4	4	4

12489	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of Our lives the author created many moods. One mood was @CAPS1 and Friendship. @PERSON1's parents kept their arms open for anyone who needed help. so did every neighbor he hade. They all came together and had fun even when they had different backrounds. You hade to make as many Friends as you could to help you live a healthy life.          Another mood that was created was calm. In the house there was ""Passionate Cuban music"" and the air smelled of traditionally Cuban @CAPS2. This was because their family was Cuban so they wanted to keep traditions and make a better environment.             The last mood that their was was harsh and sacrifice. @PERSON1's Parents had to give up a lot like family, friends, job, and have just to move to @LOCATION1.  And when they got here they had to start fresh and take any jobs they could Find. His parents life was hard they tried to make it as good as they could For, their son. It was hard for them but they got by and did a great job."	3	4	4
12494	5	"The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 his family, and how not all family members are blood relitives. Narciso grew up in a house filled with culture and love. His ""young parents created a traditional Cuban home…"" that Narciso would grow up in. Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez talks about ""the real definition of 'family.' "" @CAPS1 explains how it there were people of no relation who were considered family. His parents would keep ""their arms and the door open to the people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso Rodriguez tells of his home were @CAPS1 learned that a family is a group of people who care for one another, and that is the mood in his memoir."	2	3	3
12498	5	"The author creates a loving, warm mood that is felt throughout all of @PERSON1's memoir. For example, ""...passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). Rodriguez's parents loved to cook, something he remembers fondly, and he shares their love to this day. The reader feels this love when reading the line. The reader feels how much @PERSON1 loves Cuban music when reading the next sentence. He even states how much he adores Cuban music even now. Another example, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). @PERSON1 even says ""warm home,"" and warmth is definitly felt while reading this line. The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can imagine this. Another example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents provided a warm envirorment opened to loved ones because they are very warm and loving people themselves. @PERSON1 and the reader feel the emotion because of @ORGANIZATION2's writing. one final example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6). The reader gets a feel of how much Rodriguez loves his parents. @PERSON1 even says  ""love."" His parents are loving people and so is @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 had a warm and loving childhood, which he depicts greatly in his memoir."	4	4	4
12509	5	"The mood in the story was very nice. Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful to his parents and friends because of their great solidarity and friendship. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the @LOCATION1. They taught Narciso rich culinary skills that he would never forget. Narciso also learned how much his family and friends mean to him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Narciso's friends and family taught him the real meaning of the words family and home."	3	2	3
12510	5	The mood of the memoir is happy and thankful. The author explains how his parents brought him to the United States. All of his neighbors were spanish, cuban or Italian. They were all friends and had a good bond. He had people at his house for dinners. It was here in the United States, that he really understood what family was or what a home was. He couldn't show his parents how grateful he was for them to go through such a hard time to make their childrens lives better. The thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful.	2	2	2
12511	5	The mood created by the story could be described as thanfullness or gratitude. After reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents. The author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright. It makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who I am. The mood that is created by this story is admiration.	2	2	2
12512	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home by the blueprints of our lives the mood is homely and friendly. The mood of friendliness is displayed from his passed In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""... the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This is where he had memorized his culture's distinct type of food. Also his mood is from the music. In paragraph two it states, ""@CAPS1 Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows the culture lurking and dancing through his house of his childhood. Lastly the mood is interpreted from his family. In paragraph four it states, ""... @LOCATION2 graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment."" This shows how friendly and inviting the were. The mood set in this home is friendly and inviting."	3	3	3
12527	5	The mood in this story is more of a positive mood. Because the auther is talking about his home and how he loves it. And how he is praising his parents for takeing a chance in america. but it could be a bad mood because they had to leave their friends behind, but they made it to america and they are a faimly and home.	1	1	1
12532	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author sets a mood. The mood that is set is happy, greatful, and loving. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The author is very happy his parents did this for him. In paragraph @NUM2 it states ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". And in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author loves his home for all the memories and friendships it holds, and is greatful to his parents who provided him with it."	2	3	3
12561	5	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive. The charactor is always complimenting his parents and is always telling him he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and culitur. Narciso strongly adores him family."	1	1	1
12596	5	"Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon."	2	2	2
12605	5	"The, mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1 nothing really happens so there is no real feeling. About half way through the @NUM2 paragraph was when the memoir started to get very @CAPS1. It is really @CAPS1 because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It says in paragraph @NUM3 that they are neighborhood was made up of, ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really @CAPS2 that those cultures could be in a friendly neighborhood during those times. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1 when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout the entire memoir."	2	3	3
12611	5	"The authors mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad."	2	1	2
12619	5	"One of the moods in the memoir was greatful. Narciso greatful to have parents who gave up so much to make a good life for him. Also he is greatful because his parents showed him how important family and friends are. This means that he was greatful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for people they loved. Another mood is peaceful because Narciso loved the Cuban music they listen to. Narciso had people over all the time, the kitchen was always being used. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. I mean his house was a peaceful and a safe place. Everyone was always at his house. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people the considered family."" the last mood I thought was happy. Narciso was always happy because his family helped so many people. Also he loved that his parents thought them so many things. I mean that he always had something to do. He was always happy to be around family and friends."	4	3	4
12622	5	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.	3	3	3
12624	5	"Based on the excerpt of the ""@PERSON1"" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happness and @CAPS1.When the author restate when the girl says I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter."	2	1	2
12628	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This is what happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone. "	2	2	2
12639	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and being thankful because in the memoir in paragraph @NUM1 when he is saying ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back."	3	2	3
12641	5	The mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood. Everything is happy when they talk about his parents welcoming the other imagrents into thier home. And how thier landlords daughter was his first friend. And then how it talks about how thier neigerhood is filled with @CAPS1, Spanish, and Italian imigrents and how they are in that neghborhood because of racism.	1	2	2
12647	5	"The mood created by the author is loving because it talks about how generous and caring his family is. ""... @LOCATION1 graced our kitchen table for meals..."" That quote gives you an idea of how close everybody is ""...family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.""  @CAPS1 around Narciso treats him like family. He learned what family really ment by living in this house during his childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the memoir you can see how Narciso loves his family and friends. Overall the main mood of this memoir is loving."	2	2	2
12652	5	The mood is very loving and happy. The way he talks about the neighborhood he grew up in and everyone was so close. Than how he talked about how caring and uselfish His parent were. Just how gratefull he is made the memoir very happy.	1	1	1
12657	5	"Narciso Rodriguez's @CAPS1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a very optimistic mood.Narciso describes how even though ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"", he and his ""family"" (which included foreign neighbors) still overcame adversity. In addition he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together as a family. Lastly he describes all the memories and celebrations that helped shape his house from a living space into place of love and friendship. It is real easy to tell that Narciso loved his family and friends all the same in a way that shaped his life."	2	3	2
12659	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a clothing designer who grew up in @LOCATION1 with all different immagrets. The mood of it is that home isn't a physical space but relationships. ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1). He had a: ""Close-Knit community of honest, hard working immigrants.."" (@NUM1). I think Narciso would be a clothing designer if he didnt grow up with these people."	2	2	2
12690	5	"The mood created by the author is a loveing and careing mood. in the second paragraph he describes the the house as having the rich culinary cooking of his paroents the passionate cuban music filled in the air the aromas of the kitchen in there warm home. he tells that in there house they have feast also the many immigrants they invite into there house until they can leave by them self or fine a place to live. he describes family has nothing to do with blood relatives every body in there neiborhood is family and they care for each other and care for any of the people who need help at the end he says ""I will never foget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" he tells how they taught him love and real defination of family he describes there house as being a Warm house. "	3	3	3
12700	5	"The author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing.  ""pasionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). The former quote was found in paragraph @NUM1 described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived. The memoir created a Family love which every person longs for in life. "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM3). Anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person. That is the family love I am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family. Another mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's sacrifice. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@NUM4). That was a quote from paragraph @NUM4. It shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you. All of which make the qualities of a good family life."	4	3	4
12707	5	"The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is different and uneek to other I have heard. I belive that the @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 is trying to make is happyness, and selflessness, and grateful. I think this because he describes his parents As selflessness and takes everyone in to theire small Apartment. I also think he is creating ""warth"" by saying that his first birthday with his parent Are comfortting That is the @CAPS1 I belive the @CAPS3 is trying to create. "	2	1	2
12711	5	The mood  Created by the author in the memoir is a happy One because in the memoir Narciso was happy with with all her parents did for her and the neighborhood was a peace one, every body reached out to help who ever needed help.	2	2	2
12715	5	"The mood created by the author is both @CAPS1 and love. At first the mood the author created was @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in @LOCATION1. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you grow @CAPS1 for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it states. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS3 the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" @CAPS3 the neighborhood. Therefore that's why I think love is another mood created by the author. These are the reasons I chose both @CAPS1 and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt. "	3	3	3
12720	5	"The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and want his family has done. The author appriciate what his parents has done to other of his parents that immigrated from Cuba. He dedicates what he has learned such as cooking, manners, and friendship to his parents. The author ""admires the strenght and preseverance and have thanked them repeatedly."" overall the author could not had a better family then this, they showed them how to live and that is what a families should accomplish."	2	2	2
12725	5	"I particularly enjoyed this memoir. The author did a fantastic job at creating a sense of love and comfort while telling his story. The first sentence that stuck out to me was in paragraph @NUM1: ""Passionate  Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" To me, that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home. It put out a sense of family in the story. The feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph @NUM2, when the author talked about his family. Especially where the author had said ""My parents  always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The family loved everybody, and used their love to help struggling people, or people who just wanted to visit, get back on their feet and stay in their home. This story was truly filled with dozens of examples of love and comfort, and I really enjoyed reading it."	4	3	4
12741	5	"In the story I just read, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, greatful, and happy.The reason why I think the author is passionate because he talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, its where your heart is. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they concider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable.I think that the author shows greatfulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. Even though he says it many times, it just isnt good enough to prove how gratful he is. His parents changed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is what he is greatful for.I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his child hood lif growing up in @LOCATION1, but still take on the cultural tredition of Cuba. He is now a fashion designer.All in all that are all the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story."	4	3	4
12747	5	"In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez' the mood of it was happy and was meant to sorta touch someone. In his memoir he explains something he found fun and amusing that he still does today ""a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)"". ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship"" this shows the neighborhood he lived him was happy and united. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. They came selflessly"" this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were."	2	3	3
12751	5	"The mood that the author gives through out this hole artical or, memoir is happiness and family. All during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" the author keeps on saying how much he is thank ful to his parents and how he loves how they were able to give him all they had to offer. That is what he ment when he said he couldn never show how much it means to him. The mood in the memoir is love, family and happiness."	2	2	2
12759	5	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is a loving one Rodriguez is looking back at all the great memories of himself and his ""family"" when @CAPS2 was young.When living in new @CAPS1 as a child, Rodriguez lived in a very loving home, and a very loving neighborhood. Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming ""... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" @CAPS2 always had neibors an friends over which @CAPS2 considered to be ""family."" The was alot of love in his neibors, and so @CAPS2 grew up with a lot of love around him. But, of course, @CAPS2 loves his parents the most.In this memoir Rodriguez is thanking his parents for being so selfless and loving him so much throuout his childhood. Rodriguez is looking back on how great of a childhood @CAPS2 had, living in a great loving neiborhood, with parents that love him alot.Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did."	2	2	2
12763	5	I believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this because @CAPS1 someone imagrate from a certain country of poverty or unjust laws this community or neighborhood will take you in. this community is made up of Cuban spanyards and italians all have left there homelands to persue a better life for either them, the family, for there kids In conclusion the mood of this memoir is happy because it is enlightening and welcome place to be.	1	2	2
12767	5	In the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his child hood home. He only recounts good things and happy memories in the entire memoir. He also speak of cherished childhood memorys and how good his cummunity was and parents.	2	1	2
12771	5	I think in my opion is that the author was very comfortable with his words and his way of being human. His parents was originally from cuba, @CAPS1 was in to there culture nice to other in there surrounding. For an example @CAPS2 say It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country and where I celebrated His first birthday.	1	1	1
12777	5	Narciso @PERSON1 so proud he was Cuban immigrante and how his parent did so much for him. he realized that (in paragraphy @NUM1) family had nothing to do with being blood relative. And How all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family. How his parent turn a regluar house into home that he loved. He was grateful how his parent made so many sacrifice that turn something into life time expenence that he will never forget. He was happy how little thing turn it great memories, that he can't wait to tell the world.	2	3	3
12804	5	In the memoir narciso rodriguez by The blueprints of our Lives The mood the author created in the memoir was grateful the author created that mood because he was and is still grateful abought how his parents left behind their family and friends and Jobs so that he can have a better life also the mood is grateful because they passed on their rich culinary skills to him.

13000	5	In this memoir, the auther creats a mood. The mood that this author creates is the gratefulness. The reason that I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is so greatful, and so happy to have two loving, caring, selfless parents. He's grateful to have not only a house, but a warm, cozy home, where he's grown up in and had so many memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional cuban home, with the food, the music, and all of the people Narciso is grateful that his Parents basically just gave up their own lives and dropped everything, so that he could have a better life. Nariso cannot imagine @CAPS1 to @LOCATION1 not knowing the language, not knowing anything, and leaving everything he knows behind. However that's what his parents did. they sacrificed so much for him. and he appreciates that more than anything. I think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect.	3	3	3
13007	5	The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation. That was hard because he was Cuban.

It was happier because we Know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir and nice and passionate.The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious.

She tells us that her parents bolth cook traditional Cuban foods and teach her how to cook as well. Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family stays with her a lot, such as uncles aunts, cousins, grandparents, they @CAPS1 stay whith her until they are able to get on their feet again.

13140	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the mood is happy. Narciso is happy with his family and his cultre. He is glad that he is with his family. Narciso Rodriguez loves his talent, but he is just a little sad that he won't be able to meet his real grandparents. That is the only thing that he is sad about.

13144	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. @PERSON1 is greatul for many reasons. Some things he is greatful for is his parents his home his culture and his family. I say this because he mentioned these topics alot in the memoir. One reason he is greatful is for his parents culinary skills, As said in the memoir ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"".  Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is greatful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". The next reason @PERSON1 is greatful for his family because they are always there for him that is the reason his parents always keeps the door open to family. @PERSON1 is greatful for life and love.

13167	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy because he was always gratefull for everything his parents had done for him (Narciso Rodriguez). My opinion-I think that Narciso Rodriguez had told us students and adults a little bit of his life because he might want people to understand what he had went through in his life, and see how he got this way and how he got to Where he is today or now.	1	1	1
13175	5	"The author creates a peaceful mood in the memoir. Its peaceful because you can just picture the admiration in his voice when he talks about his family. One reason he loves his family is because, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same."" This means that their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This means that even though everything they have known is in Cuba, they wanted their children to have better lives and chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on. These are some examples as to why the author has set a peaceful mood in the memoir."	3	3	3

13198	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was very happy and thankful. He grew up in a traditional Cuban home where his parents cooked and he was able to get a great sense of ""family"". Not just blood relatives but everyone who would do the same as them. There was no racism within their neighborhood. They all came togather Many people, and the for dinner everynight. His parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him. His simple house was a home. These things created the happy and thankful mood"	2	2	2
13204	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez is a loving and scaring one. Through out the memoir Narciso talked about how his whole neighborhood ""came together.""

13206	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a very strong mood, and describes it very well. The mood of the story is happiness. One way the author describes this is with all the appretation in the memoir. The author really appretaties all the things his parents have done for him, that were really hard for them to do. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" One more way the author reinforced the mood is with the carring in the story. Narciso cares so much for everything his parents did for him. Also, how his family would let other relatives stay with them and care for them. Lastly, all the culture helps the mood. The description of the cuban food and music and how they celebrate creates happy thoughts in the reader's mind. As you can see, the author was very good at creating a mood."	4	3	4
13208	5	"The moods created by the author in the memoir are loving, care, family, sacrafice, and warmth. All of these moods are demonstrated when the author describes all of what her interpretation of family is, and when she described everything her parents have done for her. The passage that states: ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."", @CAPS1 that the parents sacrificed so much, and cared and loved their children so much that they were willing to give up their lives in their country and leave behind everything in order to make Narciso's life better.

I think the overall mood of this memoir is joy and happines.There is a flowchart on the bottom of the page, @NUM1 columns: one is mood, the other support. Under mood is happy and grateful.

13331	5	This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez had a warm down to earth feeling. Narciso expresses his love for everything given to him. I can tell he has a huge heart and it all starts at home. In the second paragraph he talks about his home life. Everything about his family gave me a warm sunny feeling. He sets the mood by talking about his amazing parents, they are wonderful. They incorporate their culture into everything. Food gives everyone a fuzzy feeling inside.Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives shows the warm welcoming feeling Narciso get when thinking about his family.  	3	2	3

13341	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the over all mood is happiness. ""The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote explains how much he loved his child hood home. The last sentence in the memoir which says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."", really shows how much he apreciates his parents hard work in the home they made for him. The author of this memoir seems to look back on his childhood happily though his family struggled finantially and personally."	3	3	3
13348	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the @CAPS1 create a mood in this memoir. ""Growing up in this environment instilled im me sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood related."" That mean people that weren't blood related, he still constiders them an family. He also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That mean that evan though it wasn't a nice house it was still his home and he loved it. The mood of this memoir is love and he will never forget it. Thats the kind of mood in this memoir."	2	3	3
13357	5	"The mood created by the author was structured around many things. First of all, it is a light, warm, happy mood as the author describes how he grew up in a simple but loving neighborhood. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" It continues to be a friendly, cheerful mood throughout the whole memoir. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author describes how ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir. It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again."	2	2	2
13366	5	The mood would probably be happy and sort of sad at the same time because on one hand he's describing his family's happyness and unity amongst his family and Spanish and Italian family's around the area but also segregation in @LOCATION1.	1	1	1
13381	5	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and @CAPS1. I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are surten parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1 and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir.	1	1	1
13394	5	"The author created a loving and accepting mood in the memoir. He first does this when talking about his familys dinner table. The author says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This shows that his parents would help anyone and treat anyone like family in a time of need. Second, the author describes this mood in @CAPS1 seven. He opens the @CAPS1 with, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and were I celebrated my first birthdays."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). His parents were so loving and caring that they celebrated with complete strangers and family their arrival. Lastly, the author ends his memoir with a powerful sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author completes the mood by stating that his parents created a home by being loving and caring and accepting other refugees that came into the United States. Throughout the author's memoir, he creates a mood of loving, caring, and accepting."	4	4	4
13401	5	"There are alot of ways to describe the mood in this memoir, The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming.One example is in paragraph @NUM1, when Narciso Rodriguez is describing his house, he says, ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM2, when he says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, ""they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.In the memoir the mood that is created is heartwarming. Narciso Rodriguez's parents did a lot of this for him to make him feel like its Cuba. In my prospective this memoir is probably the most touching to my heart."	4	4	4
13409	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say a loving mood because through-out the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says ""countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" That is the final reason of why I think the mood of the memoir is a loving mood."	3	4	4
13410	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, by @PERSON1, he talks about how thankful he is. One thing is that he is thankful for his babysitter and friend giving them food when they needed it. Also he was thankful for the community he had. Lastly, he was thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice.He said that ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table more often than not."" (@NUM1, Rodriguez) this shows he everybody helped each other out.Next he says that ""our neighborhood... Came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (@NUM2, Rodriguez) this how close-knit Rodriguez's community was. Lastly, he says that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how thankful he is toward his parents for sacrificing almost everything for him.By Narciso Rodriguez wrote this in a thankful mood. He thanks his babysitter, he thanks his community, and he thanks his parents. All of them contributed to his life."	3	3	3
13434	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness and satisfaction. I know this because in the story the main character is happy. As he arrives in New Jersey he enjoys how his parents create their house looking like a traditional Cuban home. He is passionate of the Cuban music that he adores listening too everyday. Another thing is that the main character is satisfied of what his parents do for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last thing is that he is thankful to his parents because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thank them repeatedly."" These are the moods the author created in the memoir."	3	3	3
13439	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir the author's mood feel sad. Because in the cuba, @PERSON1, had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. In author memoir @CAPS1 will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice.	1	1	1
13453	5	"The author creates a gratefull mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the @NUM2 sentence the author states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This @CAPS1 that the author is gratefull enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood related parents. In paragraph @NUM3 In the first @NUM4 sentences the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with carage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This @CAPS1 that the author is also generous because he realizes the love and sacrafice it takes to do this. Also, In paragraph @NUM5 sentence @NUM4 he says that he has told his parants that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents."	3	3	3
13464	5	"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM2). Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere. The author says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir a passionate mood is displayed. "	3	4	4
13475	5	The mood in this memoir is one of gratitude. This is first seen in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about cooking and Cuban music. It is also in paragraph @NUM2 when he talks about leaving their home countrys. A third time is seen in paragraph @NUM3 when he tries to say thank you, but can't find the right words. The mood in this memoir gratitude and it is easiest to see in paragraphs @NUM1, @NUM2, and @NUM3.	2	2	2
13492	5	"Narciso Rodriguez tried to create a warm feeling in your heart, remembering all of the pleasant childhood memories, and to think about all the sacrifices our parents made, to try to give us a good life. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers,""said @CAPS1 while trying to explain how parents only want to give their children a good life."	2	2	2
13506	5	The mood of the menoir is grateful And thankful And it is somthing @CAPS1 @CAPS1 Never will Forget And the comfart of his home.	1	1	1
13511	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON2, the mood is friendly. Anybody was allowed to stay at his house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents were ready to take anyone in because they knew they also would. Their community had a strong bond. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was life in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Getting with family and celebrating was the theme of their home. @CAPS1 loved and cared for each other in the neighborhood."	3	4	4
13524	5	"The mood created by @PERSON1, the author of the memoir, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a comforting one. This is shown, for instance, by his reccolection of his childhood in his family's home being fond. For example, he states that he is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents passing on, ""their rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" that he claims to still have. Also, he remembers life as being neighborly and treating neighbors and friends as part of their family with kindness and sharing. This is shown when Narciso says, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In addition the comforting feeling is shown when Narciso says, ""I learned here about how to love.... My parents turned this simple house into a home. This shows that Narciso had a great place to grown up in and has fond and comforting memories of it."	3	3	3
13530	5	"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew. Wether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind."	4	4	4
13537	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez is caring, loving, happiness, and being grateful.

He is also happy to have a loving home and parents who love and care about him. Narciso is grateful for his loving home and his loving parents.The author created these moods because they are specific memoirs of his life and he feels all of these moods for the house that he has and for the parents that he loves.

Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us. and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not.""@CAPS1, the mood is described as warm and family-like.

13570	5	"The mood created by narciso Rodriguez was appreciation, or that's what I got out of it. Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. ""I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them What they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done...""p. @NUM1.

13583	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy thankful mood. The why it is a happy thankful mood is for the reason why he talk's about his family and how they sacraficed so much just for him.

He described his neighborhood as being made up of ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" As a final sentence, the author stated how we ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""	2	3	3
13621	5	"The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love.The reason why I say love is because to me he cares about the his family and he also stayed with his family tradition and he care and follows them. He also loved being with his family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say; ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE.

14841	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten."	3	3	3
14842	6	The obstacles the builders face were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3	3
14849	6	"The @CAPS1 The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet obstacled ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State building. The obstacles that builders of the Empire State building had to overcome were that wind speeds where the dirigibles would land were too strong and would whip the balloon around like a rag doll. They would ""have to use lead weights"" which would pose another problem, questioning the foundation of the building. The weight of the building also the weight of the lead weights might collapse the structure. The gases they use ""hydrogen and hellium"" make the balloon fly, but hydrogen ""is highly flamable and can't be used in populated areas."" There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 are the obstacles and the reason ""the mooring mast of The Empire State building was destined never to fullfill its purpose""."	3	3	3
14861	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the safety issue. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose."	3	3	3
14883	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"" (Mast) Which would have made the builders completely alter the buildings structure. Another reason was safety At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants."	3	3	3
14910	6	"The builders of the empire state building encountered many obstacles. These obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the steel frame of the empire state building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation."" Another obstacle was safety. Having an accident would be detrimental to many peoples' lives, because it is located in such a densely populated area. Also the winds made the whole thing very dangerous. Lastly there was an existing law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas."	3	2	3
14918	6	The builders of the empire state building where faced with multiple problems for their idea in for what the building would be used for.The first problem for the builders came up about the buildings frame. A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building held by only one cable would cause to much stress to the buildings frame. the load of the dirigible and the wind would have to go to the buildings foundation, which was much to far below. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. The architects made changes to the building to fit these needs. But again the architects we're presented with a problem. The mast of the building would cause problems that should have been spotted by the architects way befor construction. the biggest problem having to do with safety issues. most dirigible outside the country used hydrogen wich is highly flammable. There already had been an exsplosion one over New York could be to much.	2	3	3
14928	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained why there is a landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The first obstacle the workers faced was there was no Landing space on the top of the Empire State Building. This means dirigibles could @CAPS4 at all. To fix the problem of not having a Landing area is, they would add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building. The workers used a @CAPS2 of money to make the building so it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles was held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so violent that the dirigible couldn't maneuver. to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out they gave up. Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained what the workers tried to do to get a dirigible to @CAPS4 on the Empire State Building in the excerpt The Mooring Mast.	2	3	2
14939	6	Al Smith was a very competitive person: one of @CAPS1 Al had to go through is competing with another building and he had to make his building taller Than the Chrysler building. Wich in @DATE1 if he didn't make his building taller he would of lost the tittel of The tallest building in new york	0	0	0
14967	6	"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished."	4	3	4
14968	6	Now, people know what a ludacris idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building; however, in the @DATE1's and @NUM1's people were oblivious to the idea many failures and the obstacles the builders would face. One obstacle that was faced was that most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and put the city at risk. Another obstacle was nature, due to the winds on top of the Empire State Building it was hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mast. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Overall, the idea could not be projected into a real-life, visual interpretation because of the obstacles faced by the builders of the mast, now people have airplanes and airports to dock the planes - theres no use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building regarding aviation.	3	3	3
14971	6	"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building builders faced an onslaught of problems that should have been easy to pick up on. Everyone got caught up in the hype in my opinion. Outside of the U.S., other dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Winds also played an obstacle in the construction. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles would not be able to tie to the dock and stay because of violent air currents. There was a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...,"". Finally, times changed and planes became the new fad for air transport, ending dirigibles run as the main provider."	3	3	3
14974	6	There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp.	3	3	3
14992	6	Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame.Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the empire state.	3	3	3
15001	6	"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start.  The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""  Modifications would have to be made to the entire building.  Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building.  As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible.  These obstacles, baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely."	3	3	3
15008	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted talks about The Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building of how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used @CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It meant that the building could catch on fire and whole downtown New York. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building"	3	3	3
15011	6	"The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building @CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to @CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because @CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" @CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" @CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles @CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles."	3	3	3
15028	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety. The hydrogen in them is highly flammable and after the accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened right in New York. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes.	1	2	2
15033	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph nine it states ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof."" This obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building. Another reason as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This shows this was another major obstacle for the builders. Another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" this could be very dangerous. If the back of the ship was dangling over the streets surrounding the empire state building there could be many safety hazards. These obstacles were the main obstacles the builders had to face if the Empire State building would be a landing dock."	4	3	4
15055	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers.	2	3	3
15061	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramicaclly shifting because of the air currents. Because of this the Dirigible end would swivlle around the top of the building. An other issue was the people walking the @CAPS1 of New York below the building. To stop a Dirigible heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problamatic because one of the weights could very easily come lose and @DATE1. The law that was about a flying airship lingering too low over a city would be broken if a Dirigible had been stationd at the Empire State building.	3	3	3
15062	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prominent issue; if human lives are at risk, an idea is not likely to be successful. Most foreign dirigibles contain hydrogen, an element that is ""highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1) and posed a threat to not only the passengers, but the people at the docking station as well. Another potential obstacle was the violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to blow around freely with the wind. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the dirigible with lead weights was dangerous; lead weights would be left ""dangling high above pedestrians"" (paragraph @NUM2). A final and very obvious obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre-existing law prohibiting airships that fly ""too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Even with a safe docking station, landing would be illegal. Although it may have seemed like a feasible plan at the time, the idea of dirigibles docking on the top of the Empire State building was not a safe or practical one."	4	3	4
15072	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was one of safety, most blimps outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle the builders faced, was nature itself. The wins on top of the building are always changing because of dangerous air currents. These winds would cause the rear end of the blimp to move around and around the mooring mast.A third obstacle they faced was a law that aircrafts couldn't fly too low over pedestrian filled areas. This law makes it illegal to tie up to the Empire State Building.	3	3	3
15077	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in atempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The bigest obstacle is to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. One set of engineers and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of moooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to vilant air currents. These are some of the many obsticles of the Empire State building faced wile atempting to alow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2	2
15081	6	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such height.      Dirigibles, mostly outside of the U.S., were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is extremely flamable gas which was very dangerous above a highly populated are such as downtown @LOCATION2. Safety was a major concern an accident like Hindenburg was something they do not want to risk.      The ability of docking a lightweight flyer was also very difficut. With strong winds, after the tethor cable was attached, the back end of the air craft would be blown around making the aviator of the blimp hard to control.      Also, a law stating aircrafts may not fly too low to the buildings was stated especially after the incodent of hindenburg in New Jersey. A blimp could possibly hit a spire of another building     The reality of docking these lightweight aircrafts was a major saftey and difficult concern. These obstacles are what builders of the empire state building faced.	4	4	4
15097	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted their were obstactes the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was the terrible winds. In the excerpt it states how bad the winds are. One dirigible was going to try to dock there was the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough because of the very strong winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's shell. Another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey they realize how much worse an accident like that would be on such a densely populated area like downtown New York City. And that is the obsacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The huge wind gusts. The Law. And don't forget what happens of the dirigible crashes in the area of New York City."	4	3	4
15116	6	"In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the @CAPS1. One obstacle that constructors faced was modifications, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation."" With this obstacale contractors would need to reinforce the @CAPS1 of the frame and the foundation. And the obstacle as stated from the excerpt is ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable."" @CAPS2 that hydrogen is flammable it would not be good if a dirigible exploded over the streets of New York. Those are the obstacles contractors faced during the construction of the Empire State Building."	3	2	3
15128	6	"Based on the excerpt, the workers faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the architects say that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building."" The reason for this is because the top of the roof is held together by just one cable tether. The effect of landing something so heavy on the roof would add stress the the buildings frame. In order to allow the dirigibles there they would need to strengthen and modifi the buildings framework, this would cost at least over @MONEY1. Rather than doing that the architects designed a glass, chrome and stainless steel tower that was @CAPS1 from inside. This would ""rise a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" -paragraph @NUM2. Elevators would also be inside to help the passengers board the dirigibles."	3	2	3
15134	6	"The builders faced a few problem on letting it dock there. One problem was that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" said on page @NUM1. The were all so lead weights to lower the dirigibles down but this could also set risk for people said on page @NUM1."	2	2	2
15135	6	"In the the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had to acomidate a lot of thing to allow dirigibles to dock at The mooring mast. For example In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to modify and strengthen to accommodate this new situation"". Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was natur itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These factores and many more where the reason the mooring mast was never poot to use do to the feer of safty and law."	2	3	3
15137	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. An obstacle dealt with if the dirigibles were fit to dock in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle dealt with the mast. These obstacles made this construction a failure such as the author who says, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" in @CAPS1 thirteen.First of, @CAPS1 five states the dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make some lighter in the air."" @CAPS1 six states that, ""Some were as long as one thousand feet."" @CAPS2 how may a blimp of that size ever managed to land on the Empire State Building. Also @CAPS1 nine says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This @CAPS1 also states that ""The stress the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.""These were just a few of the obstacles the builders had to face. The fate of the mast such as in @CAPS1 @NUM1 says ""was neither practical nor safe."" The architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. In the end the mast was a great attempt, but indeed a failure."	1	2	2
15143	6	Acording to the @CAPS1 both the @CAPS2 and the architects came across several obsticles when it came too building an Area Where Blimps could land that made this @CAPS3 unfesable. One of the @CAPS4 Reasons that this @CAPS3 @CAPS5 was due to the Air laws that made it illegal to fly too low in urban Areas. An additional conflict was fact was that @CAPS6 winds could push the tale of the blimp into sharp spires of neighboring buildings that would pop the dirigible as if it where a balloon.	2	2	2
15152	6	"In this project to construct a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were some problems. The idea of the mooring mast was to be able to dock dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building + be able to have passengers get on + off the dirigible from + into the building. The big problem that it faced was the wind speeds that high up in the air. At nearly @NUM1 feet in the air the wind would be whiping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible. When New York governor, Al Smith put forth ideas to construct this mast nobody realized untill after that it was a somewhat rediculous task. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be down to reality."	2	1	2
15165	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght,  the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible	3	3	3
15173	6	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 they described the greatest reason was one of the safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.In paragraph @NUM2 they also describe another obstacle was the nature itself because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Even dirigles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, this could be dangerous for pedestrians. In paragraph @NUM3 they describe another reason why dirigles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are some examples of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles docking there.	4	4	4
15203	6	"In the excerpt from ""the mooring Mast""by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but it will become a hazard for pedestrians. Finally there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it ilegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). the law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to make the airship to land on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, it was too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the challenges put upon builders to build a dock."	3	4	4
15213	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new siteation, @MONEY1' worth of modifications were made to the buildings framework, Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.The mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the @ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. Weather, such as violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mast.	3	3	3
15215	6	"During the construction of the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, architects and builders were faced with many obstacles. Before the mooring mast was installed at the top of the building, it became evident that ""the stress of the dirigible's load... would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that changes would need to be made in the framework in order to support the weight. In addition, safety, weather, and legal issues were at hand. Filled with flamable gas, there was always a risk of a dirigible catching fire, and in an urban area the damage would be extremely bad. Winds at the top of the building were also dangerous. Air currents were ""violent"" and ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"" (paragraph @NUM2). Normally, the ships would be weighted down, but, again, this was not possible in a city. The last issue builders faced was the law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Although there was a law clearly against it, two dirigibles attempted to dock. Both attempts were failures and it became clear that the Empire State Building would not be able to serve as a dirigible landing."	3	4	4
15218	6	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof because it would be able to support it. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame. To fix this problem the @ORGANIZATION1 steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible.	2	2	2
15223	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2	3
15234	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles."	4	3	4
15244	6	"Besides The facts That docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on The empire State building would cost over @MONEY1 and add a lot of Stress to the buildings frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream.Unfortunatly, he couldn't do that. There are @NUM1 big reasons. in paragraph @NUM2 it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium.

15282	6	"In some cases builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety. As stated in the reading. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: dirigibles outside @LOCATION1 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible was to catch fire on top of that building it could do a lot of damage. The next reason is there are ""laws against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The Empire State building was built in the middle of downtown, if something was to go wrong the dirigibles could harm a lot of people. Another reason is because of nature. The author stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This put the dirigibles at risk of hitting that building or another. The last reason is because ""the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed."" If the law and safety hadn't been a problem there would be no way to land a dirigible because they didn't have the things needed to land it. The obstacles made happened because they failed to fully look over their plan."	4	4	4
15285	6	"The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was competing with the Chrysler Building in being the tallest building. Al Smith, the governor at that time, didn't want to be beat. Being the governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building developing it into a dirigible dock.As time went on, the building ran into more problems. Tying a thousand-foot dirigable to the building, would add stress to the frame. ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to be accomadate this new situation"" The frame around the building wasn't durable enough to hold a ""blimp"" The building would collapse while taking other buildings down. sixty-thousand dollars went into re-fining the frame but in the end, the building still failedAfter the frame was stable enough, more problems ocured. ""The greatest reason was one of safety Dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it flammable."" Not only did the reason of safety of people went aganist the Building so did the law ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" once Al Smith realized even the law forbidded this, all plans that rose into action stoped, and the Empire State Building remained the same."	3	3	3
15293	6	"In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the obstacles faced was that putting a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. This made the builders have to modify the frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flamable."" This would put great danger to the people of New York. That was a huge problem the builders faced. The builders at the Empire state Building faced many obstacles but safety and reconstruction were just some of those problems."	2	2	2
15313	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building envisioned leading dirigibles moor at the top, there were some critical flaws. For one thing, a thousand foot dirigible moored to such a small focal point with the wind pressure and its own load would exert enormous pressure on the building's frame (p. @NUM1). This could potentially lead to the building's collapse is due to the strain. Another reason was at such high altitudes, the wind is quite violent and would sway the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither ""... practical nor safe."" (p. @NUM2). If something went wrong, the dirigible could take out another building or worse: fall. A more practical, legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities. A dirigible mooring to a mast, even at that height, was illegal (p. @NUM3). Therefore, with so many obstacles it was deemed impractical to use the Empire State Building as a high-altitude dock."	3	4	4
15339	6	Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications Safety was a major concern.  Battling with the harsh winds would also be a problem.When the idea of the mast was created, not many realized the reality of the concept.  To put an extremely heavy object and attach it to just a tether, was not safe enough.  The combination of combustible gases also suggested pulling down town New York at risk.To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds.  Guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong winds.The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles when constructing the mooring mast.	3	3	3

15399	6	"The Empire State building is one of the tallest buildings ever built. It way because of this, that it was impossible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. The article by @ORGANIZATION1 titled ""The Mooring Mast"" describes well the problem blimps may have encountered. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wins on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" It's true, should a blimp try to moor there it would do nothing but twirl around the mooring mast. It could also crash into other buildings. It could tear up the mooring mast. There was so much the builders didn't look into."	2	2	2
15423	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia Lüsted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add stress to the building's frame so steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened."	2	3	3
15431	6	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many challenges the builders of the Empire State building faced while they had high hopes in creating the world's tallest building. They added on hundreds of feet allowing dirigibles to dock there. Competing with the Chrysler building, Al Smith announced that the Empire State building would reach 1,250 feet beating the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Al Smith was desprite to do whatever he could to construct the world's tallest building, even to create a landing spot for dirigibles. @ORGANIZATION2's idea didn't work out as planned. Instead, the @CAPS1 assigned to dirigible passengers was made into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden.	0	0	0
15443	6	"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasnt. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening.

Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it realistic."	3	3	3
15452	6	In the excerpt the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. The builders did not think of what would happen to the dirigibles if something went wrong. Also on how tall they are makeing the empire state building.The first obstacle the builder faced in building the empire state building was what if something happened to the dirigibles. For example what if the dirigibles are highly flamible like the Hindenburg. The second obsticle the builders faced was on how tall they made it because of how tall it was the wind current was very strong.In the excerpt the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. They tried to over come them but there were to many.	2	2	2
15453	6	The obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. One of the obstacles to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also, the Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state buildings flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds	3	4	4
15454	6	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of their problems included, the structure of the building, the wind and weather conditions, and the safety of their passengers. The stell frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a stainless steel skeleton. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and would need lead weights to hold it down. This was clearly considered unsafe. Finally the safety of the passengers, was at stake because the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Also, There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building due to the many obstacles.	3	3	3
15464	6	"From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2 we find that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their first obstacle was to figure out how to transfer ""the stress of the dirigible's load and windpressurs"" to the buildings foundation. Another was to modify the steel frame of Building and strengthen it to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast. And so the builders did modify the building and assigned a mooring mast, but when construction was completed builder came upon another obstacle. ""most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a danger if any would go up in flames above New York. The greatest obstacle with the winds. They were constantly shifting making it difficult for any dirigibles to even get close to the mast even if the could get to the mast the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast where in open fields dirigibles would be weighed down with lead weights. at the Empire state building they would be dangling higabove pedestrians, this was niether practical or safe. Because of all the obstacles the Mooring Mast would never be used"	4	4	4
15481	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obsticle was nature itself. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building.	3	3	3
15484	6	"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin."	3	4	4
15497	6	Durining the @DATE1 and the 1930s, there was a fierce competition arising over constructing the largest building. To set the Empire State Building apart from the @ORGANIZATION1 decided to put a mooring mask for dirigibles. This would have both meaning and make the Empire State Building the worlds largest building. The mooring mask was certin to fail for a few reasons. For one, forign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flamable and would cause a huge fire @CAPS1. Another reason is above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantely shifting. This would make it very difficult to control the dirigible. Pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty @CAPS2 their dirigible. Lastly the mooring dock failed because of the law. This law stated that it is illegal to fly air ships to low over urban areas. On 1931 @CAPS3 Clavan @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 of the mooring mask. By the late 1930's the Idea was dead.	3	3	3
15500	6	"The builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. There were several problems with the design and location of the mooring mast One problem was that ""the winds on top of the building, were constantly shifting."" Even though the architects adjusted the design of the mast, it was still too dangerous to land a blimp.Another major problem, was the dirigibles themselves They were filled with combustable hydrogen. If a blimp was to catch fire, like the Hindenburg, the debris would fall on the pedestrians' below. The last problem was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas.""In conclusion, due to laws, the dirigibles and nature, the mooring mast was not used."	2	3	3
15508	6	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified.  The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame.  For this reason they first had to make @MONEY1 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph @NUM1).  The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.  In the end, the fact that there was so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all.	3	4	4
15521	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Dirigibles used hydrogen, ""... rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2. line @NUM3) The greatest obstacle faced by the builders was nature. As the winds were shifting at the top of the building, the back of the dirigibles swiveled around the mast. Previous solutions; ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights..."" (@NUM4. line @NUM3-5) were not safe with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Lastly, an obstacle they faced was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM6. line @NUM7) this made it so the dirigibles could not even approach this area. There were several obstacles faced when the builders were trying to make the Empire State building a docking station."	3	4	4
15535	6	"According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of the mass, he seems to be overambitious. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader gets the sense of how competitive Smith was, which is a quality that can get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear to the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a lot of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort needed for this was an obstacle as well. The mast delayed completing the whole building and as @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM2, the mast caused unsolved problems and postponements. A significant reason to the failure of the mast was the issue of safety because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" These both show the impracticality of the installment of a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced. Because ambition was more important than practicality in the building of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles and failed."	3	1	2
15539	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that United States dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigible was ever destroyed by fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York the accident could be very dangerous. One of the grestest obstacle of using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dangling lead weights to weigh it down over pedestrians on the streets was niether practical nor safe. The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 tells a few obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
15545	6	Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumutuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to manuever a dirigable at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigable even come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: @CAPS1 are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a density populated urban area would have horrific results.	3	3	3
15554	6	When building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. From the reading excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted stated that dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, tha't four blocks in New York City. This brought up the first obstacle, which is they have no where to land this thing. They couldn't put it above new york because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it support the weight of the dirigible. The biggest obstecle, they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area.	2	3	3
15560	6	"From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours. However, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add stress to the frame of the building. One of the greatest obstacle builders faced was the wind or nature. The strength of the wind were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For safety reason, most dirigibles weren't safe because they mostly used hydrogen and hydrogen is flammable. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Due to the obstacles the builders faced, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared."	4	3	4
15583	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building went through many difficult obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the difficult obstacles the builders went through is that the winds on top of the building were always shifting. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" This quote is describing how bad the winds were and how it made it difficult for the builders to work. To solve that problem, the builders could have weighed weighed down the back with lead; but that would cause it to be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. ""But using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe."" This quote is explaining how using lead would not be safe. Another problem is that it is illegal for airships to fly too low to urban areas. ""@CAPS1 an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This quote explains the law about airships. Clearly, the builders had many difficult obstacles."	3	3	3
15597	6	"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as dowtown New York."" They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult."	3	3	3
15602	6	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas. The invention of docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was unrealistic and unsafe.	3	3	3
15616	6	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many hard tasks The builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there. They also had to add on more floors on the Empire State building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to still be the tallest building. Now the architects had to had the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, this brought the Empire State building to a total of 1,250 feet. The reason that a mooring mast failed was because the dirigible highly flamable and in a highly populated area like New York it would be tragic. Also nature itself with the wind were violent air current. This would cause the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast.	2	2	2
15618	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	2	3	3
15626	6	The builders of the Empire State Building where faced with some obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. Saftey was the main focus because New York is a densly populated area and many dirigibles where filled with highly flameable hydrogen.One problem was that the builders relized the dirigible would be hanging by a single cable teather wich would add stress to the frame so they would need to adjust the building and strengthen the the frame. This costed over sixty thousand dollars to adjust. After that was taken care of the builders still had other problems.Another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area many pedestrians walk, below where the dirigibles would be docked. The winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around and lead weights could not be used because of the dangers of them falling	3	3	3
15631	6	"The workers on the Empire @CAPS1 Building ran into many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large city. Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future problem for the workers. The process was a troubling challenge overall.It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One percaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed."" The project al ltogether was unrealistic so therefor it was a great challenge for workers docking dirigibles."	3	3	3
15636	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor the for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted tpo.	1	0	1
15658	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers."	3	4	4
15660	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground.	2	2	2
15665	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. If that had happened at the Empire State Building it would have had extremely drastic results. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners of the Empire State The building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 were just three of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3	4
15679	6	To have a building built Over @NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigibles/blimbs be able to dock there is dangerous and has many obstacles around it. First, the weather is not always nice. If you have a windy day the blimb is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York. Putting lead blocks in the back would be very dangerous. you have lead in the back swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimbs outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammabe, and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread... Finally, blimbs could not moor at the Empire State building if it is against the law for an airship to hover to low to urban areas. Those are many reasons why blimps could not moor at the Empire State building.	3	3	3
15682	6	"There are many obstacles that the builders faced in order to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was safety. Foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with. According to the passage ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle was whether. The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. For example, U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind, which might have resulted in a puncture in the shell of the dirigible. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area""... Because of the many obstacles that the builders faced, the Empire State building was unable to fulfill its original purpose, but is still considered a worldwide landmark today."	3	4	4
15684	6	When building the empire state Building, the workers faced a few problems. One was how to make it @CAPS1, because the architect building the chrysler building had raised the total height, making it the largest building in the world. Al Smith, former governor of new york, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was @CAPS2 the mast to the top of the frame. It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, the people in charge would not let blimps dock at the Building, for fear of endangering the Public. Thus, the mast was never used.	3	3	3
15712	6	There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.	3	4	4
15719	6	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed desingners discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transimite stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind, this is very unsafe being close to a building.	2	2	2
15720	6	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, alot of problems were faced in allowing the dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles that were faced would put peoples safety at risk. One of the problems was the tail of the dirigibles would swirvle because of how high up it was the wind would be violent. Another problem that was stated in paragraph @NUM1 was forgeign dirigibles were made with hydrogen instead of helium so they were flamable.	2	2	2
15730	6	Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch. The body of the dirigibles swang in the breeze. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical. They worked really hard. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some @ORGANIZATION1 of mooring airships to the mast. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service.	1	2	2
15732	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to make sure that the mast wasn't too heavy to put on top of the building and when they realized it was they made @MONEY1 of modifications to the building so that it could support the mast. They also had to make sure it would be safe, transporting people through this dirigible. It depended on the wind and climate. They also had to make the building taller than the Chrysler building. They wanted to transform New @CAPS1 transportation. In the end, they realized that docking on the building was not possible if they wanted to keep everything safe to the public."	2	2	2
15754	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was trying to moor a dirigible at the top without stressing the building too much. It says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means they planned to deal with this problem by spreading this stress all the way to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, all of these obstacles that the builders faced led to the final result of being unsuccessful."	4	3	4
15768	6	The builders of the Empire State building face a couple challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it. One main problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and they didn't want to have another accident like the Hindenburg. They realized that if an accident like that had happened in a densely populated area such as New York, it would have been a thousand times worse.	2	1	2
15774	6	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 builders must faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt it states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the wind and dirigible's weight would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, about eleven hundred feet below. In paragraph @NUM2 of the excerpt it states, ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) in an area heavily populated like New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced so many obstacles that they eventually abandoned the project."	3	3	3
15780	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great."	4	4	4
15789	6	"The worker faced many obsticals while building the Empire State Building. Sence Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building he kept adding on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet tall. The builders had to redesine the entier buildings sceleton. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could hold up the mast. The mast was made so that Dirigibles could land thire and people could get on and off it. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders fixed the steel fram of the building with in two months. The building went on as planned. After awhile the people begin to see that the mas couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building."	2	2	2
15790	6	"When builders were building the Empire State Building they came across many obstacles. One problem was lack of suitable landing area in @CAPS1 (paragraph 6). Al Smith came up with the idea to put a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to land there, but there was many problems with this mooring mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" (paragraph @NUM1) architects had to strengthen the building's foundation. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent to try and modify the buildings framework. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (paragraph @NUM2) The winds were shifting and the back of the ship would swivel around, which was not safe. Another reason is that airships flew too low over urban areas. Having a mooring mast for dirigibles to land was dangerous, going against some laws, and a lot of work."	4	4	4
15794	6	"In the beginning, all the plans made for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. Dirigibles would tie up to the mast on top of the building and dock there while the passengers got off; easier said then done. Soon enough they began to realize all the flaws in this plan, there were @NUM1 main @NUM2.) After seeing how easily the ""Hindenburg was destroyed by fire"" they realize it was too dangerous having dirigibles fly over such a ""densely populated area such as downtown New @NUM3.) When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It was far to windy for the light dirigibles to stay in @NUM4.) @CAPS1 with the wind problem, if somehow a dirigible was able to be tied down ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. ""@CAPS2, unlike dirigible landing fields it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of @CAPS3 just to hold the back of the dirigibles down.@NUM1.) Unlike previously thought, dirigibles were not the way of the future, airplanes became the newer more efficient way in the late 1930's.A good idea, but as they said: ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	3	3
15800	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" By Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way; nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe. In order for it to be safe, they came to another obstacle. The entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over @NUM1 dollars worth of investment. Lastly, there already stood a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With all obstacles faced, it was never opened to the public."	3	3	3
15801	6	"The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to let dirigibles to dock were the wind conditions and how close dirigibles were to the building. The wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there. The winds near the top of the building were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The other problem the builders faced was how close dirigibles came to the building. In one case, as a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but it, ""could not get close enough to tie up..."". Even though the building was not what it was suppose to be it is still one of the greatest of all time."	3	3	3
15802	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced a lot of obstacles attempting dirigibles to dock their. One of the first obstacle the builders faced was realizing that the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. The builder's realized that the wind pressure could make the dirigible swivel which would not be suitable for the foundation of the building. strengthening the building's structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The workers also realize that the dirigibles are flamable and if something were to go wrong it would cause a devestation to a such populated area. These obstacles put and end to the dream of having mooring mast on top of the Empire state building.	3	3	3
15810	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced the @CAPS2 of purfictle placing a thousand foot dirigible on top of the Building which would of not worket out Because of the wind and there was no wait in the back that would of kept the dirigible in place in which now ment that the dirigible would have been swinging back and fort and gave the riesct of the dirigible poking a sharp point on the corner of the Empire State Building and exploding, the dirigible above New York City and putting thousand of life at dinger. The @CAPS1 also faced the @CAPS2 of getting to micheenery that was needed to @CAPS4 the mooring mast. Another obstacle @CAPS1 had to face was getting aprover do to safety hasits because what had happing to the hindenburg in lakehurst, New Jersey.	3	3	3
15820	6	"One of the big problems facing docking dirigibles is the government and the law. It is illegal to have such a low-flying aircraft. It says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle would be safety. Dirigibles are FLAMMABLE and could easily injure and kill people if an accident happened. Is to dangerous, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS2. @NUM2) Another problem is nature and weather. The winds up there are extremely high and powerful. A big danger to dirigibles, ""... violent air currents... back of the ship would swivel around... high above pedestrians,"" (@CAPS2. @NUM3)."	4	3	4
15842	6	Some obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was that the building was not stable enough to be able to moor an airship. They solved this easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton. Another obstacle that they faced was the high speed winds and being able to get passengers off and on. They never did solve this problem, and so the mooring project was shut down. The obstacles the builders faced were too many and this project soon became impossible to finish and it never was.	1	2	2
15851	6	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	2	1	2
15863	6	"Intended uses for buildings often are met with challenges. In the article ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by @PERSON1, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are discussed. The first obstacle faced is stated in paragraph @NUM1, when to build a dock on top of the building the entire building would have to be inforced. This was an obstacle because it would be at a cost of @MONEY1. Another obstacle faced was the weather. Above the building violent air currents rage. These currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring. The final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law. According to the article, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The cost of reinforcing the building, the weather, and the laws were three obstacles faced in docking blimps to the Empire State building."	3	3	3
15865	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off @CAPS1 is a major concern many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second off the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding @CAPS2 from flying to low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace. The main obstecals the builders faced were @CAPS1 concerns, high winds and the illegality of thier project.	3	1	2
15871	6	Just like in life there are many obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention that can't be easy. So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them.	2	3	3
15896	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it describes many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring Mast of the building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. One example is most dirigibles from the outside the United States used hydrogen. The united States mainly used helium, witch is not flamable like hydrogen. Luckily the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the Empire State Building. Another obstacle to the builders was nature. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. This made it unsafe for the pedestrians down below. these are the obstacles the builders had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock."	3	2	3
15911	6	It @CAPS1 like a veryhard test for them because there trying to make an age of transportation with the thoughts of the pioneers. But once the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes for the building skeleton. They have framed the 85th floor the roof had to be completed before the framing.	1	1	1
15920	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they dealt with was the fact that mooring such heavy blimps would add stress to the building. In fact, 'the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.' Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.' It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area. Lastly, the strong winds would making mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents.' The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast and it just couldn't be completed.	3	3	3
15924	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. As stated in paragraph 1 of the excerpt, the Empire State building was planned to be the tallest building in the world in the @DATE2's. The architect of the Chrysler building constructed the building to be 46 ft taller then the Empire State building. Governor of New York, Al Smith did not want loose the tittle of the tallest building. In paragraph 6 it tells you Smith's idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. And to let passengers on & off.Safety issues did not allow the mooring mast of the Empire State building to fulfill its person, said in paragraph @NUM1. Most dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Because of pointy buildings this was extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM2; the greatest obstacle was nature. On top of the Empire State building, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also, the law to fly too low. By the late 1930's the mooring mast plan disappeared."	3	3	3
15930	6	"In the @DATE1's Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's mooring system ran into many problems One obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These wins caused the dirigibles tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offsAnother obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This was feared because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York then the damage would have been catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and had a crash occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties"	3	4	4
15962	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself.	2	1	2
15975	6	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic."	3	3	3
15989	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders faced obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. An @CAPS1 the faced was A thosand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, this added stress to the buildings frame. the stress of the blimps load add plus wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. the steel frame of the Empire state building had to be strengthened to accommodate this."	1	1	1
16003	6	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock. The first was that they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building, it would have put too much stress on the buildings frame. They had to transmite the stress all the way down to the foundation of the building. They did over @MONEY1 worth of framework to the building.Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which was impossible. First off the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent ever-changing winds were too much to control the ship in. But even if they did dock the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast.Another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas. So now the ships couldn't ever approach the building to tie off to the mast.	4	4	4
16010	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One clear obstacle was the law that had existed at the time making it against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM1). Also, another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. For example on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been it had taken place in downtown New York. (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast (paragraph @NUM3). The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were too much to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast.	4	4	4
16017	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible."	3	3	3
16027	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be done. When they decided to construct a ""rocket-shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the building of the mast was completed, saftey became an issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with weights like they can in an open field. This would also be unsafe for the people of New York. The main obstacle the builders faced with saftey, which is a big issue. Therefore, the dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
16038	6	Their were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mass. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Those are some obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	2	3
16046	6	Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety.	1	1	1
16050	6	"There were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles.  One of these obstacles they faced was height, and the lack of safety that arose from it.  In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which use a highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen.  Should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about about their day.  The largest obstacle they faced though was nature.  Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only teathered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street.""  As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor say if.  The third obstacle they faced with a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas.  Even as tall as the Empire State Building is, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast.  Al Smith's idea finally had to be abandoned due to safety, nature, and state law."	3	4	4
16061	6	The obstacles the builders would have to face would be things such as structural @CAPS1, and worrying about future technological advances. Even if they found out how to land a dirigible on the platform, what about advances on them or new transportation methods. The structural @CAPS1 was a quick fix, by reinforcing the supports to the building itself.	1	1	1
16062	6	"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed."	3	3	3
16064	6	"First, there was no way to anchor any dirigibles. They couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street. Second, there were laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building. All in all it was a bad idea."	2	3	3
16068	6	The builders of the Empire state Building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. First off, a dirigible moored to the mast by just one cable would put enormous stress to the frame of the building The building's frame had to be strengthened first to allow such a project. When the mast was finished, several other problems prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of helium. Earlier, the German blimp Hindenburg had been destroyed because hydrogen was so flammable. It was realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic should it happen over a densely populated city like New York. Also, blimps moored to the mast would be blown around by violent winds, possibly pushing them into nearby buildings. The lead weights normally used to prevent this would have had to be left dangling over pedestrians, a major safety issue- @CAPS1, there was a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban settlements, making use of the mast illegal. These problems doomed the mooring mast project from the start.	4	4	4
16075	6	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock."	3	3	3
16090	6	"Based on the expert, builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building was never thought of an easy task to accomplish. As it was mentioned in the article the idea of the dirigible was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" One obstacle in which builders would face is safety. Since most of the dirigibles from outside U.S.A uses hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. This is a very dangerous obstacle to builders because fire itself is really dangerous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, however. If the winds are shifting violently, the dirigibles could be way down and be dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe to the people or the builders because it could hurt them. Another obstacle builders would face is that there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. It would make illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area. This made it harder for builders to accomplish because it's against the law."	3	3	3
16104	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had great plans to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. Although they kept their expectations high, they faced many obstacles while trying to make this happen. The first problem they ran into was the fact that the steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened due to the stress of the dirigible's load. So, the architects had to make changes to the building's skeleton. Safety was also an issue because hydrogen made the blimps flammable, which could cause a destruction by fire. There was also an existing law stating ""airships can't fly to low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to tie up to the building, let alone even reach that area. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to heavy winds, the dirigibles would swivel around too much, and the area was not open enough to weigh down the back with lead weights. So, the architects of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to successfully dock there."	3	4	4
16105	6	When the Empire State Building was @NUM1 conceived, it was planned to be the tallest building. However not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. However in trying to do this the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, & this is where the first obstacle they faced comes into play. Since the dirigibles were so long the first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's roof. That plus a @NUM2 ft dirigible moored at the top, we had stressed to the building's fram. This would be another obstacle the workers encountered. The mooring mask was destined to never fulfill its purpose, do to the safety of many people. This was yet another obstacle the workers faced. The final obstacle and the practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the building, was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. These are the many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building.	2	3	3
16111	6	"Based on the exerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."	2	2	2
16115	6	"The obstacles the builder's of the Empire state Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was safety, nature itself and the law.Safety because dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable and accident could happen like ""German dirigible Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.""nature being the second problem because violent air currents could shift the dirigible and cause damage and hurt pedestrians.Law being the last reason because there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. The statement in the excerpt says ""This law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building."" Which makes it quite pointless to have even built it in the first place."	3	3	3
16121	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" @CAPS1 obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around.Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came and played. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The idea was never successful due to the obstacles presented."	3	2	3
16126	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, would be things such as the different usage of air. A sentence I found to follow this reason would be in paragraph @NUM1 when said, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would cause many problems and face many obstacles. Another reasoning I found was wind. A reason I found would be as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This would be something difficult to fix. As other obstacles I found such as the size and density, I find these two to be the best reasoning."	2	2	2
16139	6	There were a few obstacals to making this idea work. one of the obstacals was to make the mast and the frame of the building strong enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind. There was over @MONEY1 spent on modification to the building. Also, they had to Add a few floors to the building for a total of 102 floors.	2	1	2
16141	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there.	1	1	1
16154	6	"Builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the dirigible would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed there. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars more.Another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible. Some used hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast.""The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building."" The attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building failed. There were too many obstacles."	4	3	4
16168	6	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1-foot tall spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this first obstace in building the tower, Smith decided to change the idea for the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had made it to the world's tallest building.	2	2	2
16197	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought."	3	3	3
16203	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to make a for dirigibles. The first obstacle was creating the mooring mast. In @CAPS1 four it says, ""This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zepplin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships."" The Empire State Building's frame wasn't strong enough for the mooring mast, so the builders had to modify it.

Since the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey it would have been more dangerous over a densey populated area like New York where the Empire State building was. the greatest obstacle to the success of the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were shifting due to air currents. Dirigibles would not be safe dangling high above pedestrians on the street. The major problem architect faced was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it has a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Even though it seemed like a good idea at the time, it was not practical or safe.	3	3	3
16284	6	Allowing the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building took some obstacles. First, there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on.Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all.	3	3	3
16293	6	"Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense.

The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects design is shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside-."" @CAPS1, the building had to have two extra floors added one ""open observation platform"" and a ""boarding area for dirigidle passengers. Even though the mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, the building was still hailed the world's tallest building."	2	2	3
16306	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building. All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top. All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building.	1	2	2
16315	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are: @CAPS1 they choose dirigible instead of balloon, because the fabric used in dirigibles is lighter.

Also the ornate mast would be difficult to raise on top of the Empire State build due to the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. If this happened the dirigible would crash into the Empire State Building or other building. This would be bad for the people on the street. Where dirigible's usually land are in open fields. The dirigible could be weighted down in the back with a lead weight. But on top of the Empire State Building dangling weights above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Also laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting to close to a building."	3	3	3
16331	6	The construction of the mast was intentionally a good idea, but the people who where constructing it never actually realized the true dangers of the whole idea.Although they should have known, they should have realized that because the ship was attahed to the mast in one area, the ship was bound to swing around when it comes to a windy day because of the lack of weight. The builders also had to keep in mind that because the idea was huge, they had to make it perfect. They had to realize that many other builder are going to try this con cept which means they have to lead by example. If not then the other builders would have major problems people would be in danger.The builders and men who thought about using weights to balence off the weight of the ship.

16338	6	The Empire State building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York.	3	3	3

In order to ensure safety and eliminate problems involving the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need ""to be modified and strengthened to accommodate"" the blimps, and these modification would cost up to sixty thousand dollars. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremly flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible was to blow up. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low. These difficult obstacles proved too difficult to overcome. as the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles."	3	3	3

Another obstacle the Architects had to work with was putting the mooring mast up on the building.

16399	6	In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.One obstacle was because of safety reasons. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the winds on top of the building.The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law.

The builders had to face many obstacles such as laws @CAPS1 Changes and the building @CAPS2, that was not thought about while the idea was accumulating. After creating the plan to add a mast on the top of the empire State building a docking for Dirigibles, the new airships they finally decided to look at the defaults of the already developed plan. While the mask was being designed architects realized that you ""could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the Empire States building's flat roof."" ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". When the builders were constructing their plan they didnt consider the fact that the load of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire building. ""The greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The builders realize that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and since the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas the dirigibles idea wouldnt be as easy to fulfill with all of the obstacles to over come. The obstacles the builders had to face When attempting to dock dirigibles on the empire state building were safety laws, weather and the building @CAPS2."	3	3	3
16432	6	The builders had many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was they had to make sure the building was high enough. They also had to make sure the building was durable enough. Those are some of the obstacle they had to allow the dirigibles to dock there.	1	1	1
16439	6	Obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.	1	2	2
16456	6	In the process of building the empire state building the architects had many obstacles. One main obstacle was making the foundation strong enough. Another was the wind factor. They had many problems in the building of the Empire state building.In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire state Building they had to streghten, the whale foundation. If a dirigible docked before the whale building would twist and sway. Another problem was the wind. the wind coming off of other building would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed.Even though they faced many obstacles they successfully completed the Empire State Building	2	2	2
16471	6	"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the buildings frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" @CAPS1 pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today. "	3	3	3
16483	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon Lüsted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	4	3	4
16498	6	The greatest reason was one of safty: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violen air currents	2	2	2
16518	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible (blimps) to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps.     In paragraph 6 the author states ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and let passengers off and on."" That's one obstacle of his company. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton, construction proceeded as planned."" The buildings structure didn't really help the dirigibles much."	1	1	1
16529	6	Based on excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were, to get it to work. For many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most places used to fuel there dirigibles made them highly flammable. In a highly populated areas such as New York this would be a problem.Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the building.Finally the last reason would be safety. Violent winds would make dirigibles unstable When docked to the building. There is also an existing law against airships flying too low over Urban areas.In @CAPS2 based on excerpt The Mooring Mast; by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were the flammability, money issues, and safety reasons.	4	4	4
16534	6	The builders of the Empire State building went through many obstacles. I feel bad for them because of how dangerous it was, and how long they had to work. At the same time I would have been happy to be apart of something like that. The builders could have died doing there job. Building it so high up, it must have been hot. I dont think it had to be that high they could have done the same thing but lower. Those are some of the obstacles I think the builders went through.	0	0	0
16543	6	When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flameable.	1	1	1
16551	6	The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock On the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved.	4	4	4
16552	6	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building the workers overcome countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wants to build ""the world's tallest building"" (1). At the same time the Empire State building is being designer the @ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York, is finishing construction The @ORGANIZATION2 building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. The idea of the building for acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped. The Empire State Building *************** "	1	2	2
16556	6	It show that in the Future the @CAPS1 Building was never fufill it Purpose to use.and that it is the @CAPS2 Building in new york.	0	0	0
16558	6	"Many problems arised with the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building for that the engineers did not account. While the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind. ""... modifications had to be made"" (paragraph @NUM1). Though this obstacles was able to be overcome, many others were not. Since most dirigibles outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigibles could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg, and ""owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was a problem with a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried but neither could tether safely to the building. The thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the Empire State Building's top floors are now a public tourist spot."	3	4	4
16562	6	"In the article "" The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it is apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. The dirigibles themselves could be a hazard. ""... Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""In likes of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown New York. Also, the dirigibles light mass would make it a target to high, forceful winds."" The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currets."" This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building ""... dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law thwarted many of the would-be attempts of mooring these. Mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in, ""The Mooring Mast,"" however that soon never had the chance to come true."	4	4	4
16564	6	Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constanly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem. Most importantly there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles.	4	4	4
16579	6	"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" (para @NUM1) Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dririgible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so."	3	3	3
16586	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	3	4
16604	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in making a dirigible docking stations. One of the main things was that there was a law in place that banned the use of low flying aircrafts in urban areas, like New York City. Another reason is that it was just not safe to dock these massive blimps that high. Almost @NUM1 hundred feet up the winds would have been very violent, and with the tailend of the dirigible not being fastened down, it was very likely that it could get spun around and end up tangled with the mast. Also it was not safe because many foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen which was highly flamable, and if an- accident similar to the Hindenburg with fire occurred over in urban place like New York City it could have been very tragic. Lastly in order to build the mast builders had to re inforce the frame of the building so that it could bear the stress that such a station would put on the structure.	3	4	4
16608	6	When Designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the empire state Building there were @CAPS1 oBstacles that the @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 were faced with. One proBlem was they couldent @CAPS4 drop the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building Because it was too @CAPS5 for the frane of the Building. So Because of that proBlem The @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 had to come up with a way to modifey the frame of the Building so that the Building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem that they were faced with was that it was @CAPS4 too dangerous. I was deemed dangerous Because most dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen which was extremely flammable and they couldent @CAPS8 having @CAPS9 happend to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors aBove city streets that were crowded with people. So those Were @CAPS4 a few oBsticals that @CAPS2 were faced with when building the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building	3	2	3
17841	7	Un Patience @CAPS1.   My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hipper non patience horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is very un patient. He is always hipper and ready to go. For example when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trains he dose not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And that’s when he gets unpatient. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient but I have always failed. I guess he just always has to be doing something. But I will always love him no matter how un patience he is.	8	8	16
17845	7	You know that life is so much harder when you don’t have the patients. If you don’t then I’m going to tell you why. There was a time that found out I was going to @LOCATION1 now that’s the good part but when I ask “how are we getting there?” we had to fly and right then and there I knew I was going to have to be very patient and I thought I didn’t have enough patients to fly to @LOCATION1. Although I got through it. Now the worst thing was when I got to @LOCATION1 it was very hot out. We had to stand outside to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patients and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn’t want to wait for the ride anymore. Haha I came to my sences and I start out it was why easier to wait and the bus eventaly showed up and I already felt way better.	8	8	16
17849	7	One day, my soccer team was in the chamionchip game in we facing the lions. At the start of the game I was on the bench I was the worst on my team. After the @DATE1 we were up @NUM1 but my coach still put me on the bench and I just sat there and cheered for my. The next to quarters went by and it was tie game @NUM2. Half way through the @DATE2 are star player got hurt so coach put me in. I had no due what do I was just chassing the ball. With one minute left I was standing by their goalie and one of my team mates shot the ball zinged through the air and hit me in the foot. The ball redirected into the goal my team started to cheer we were up @NUM3. After the @DATE2 minute was done and horned went off and every one cheered again and lifted me up. That’s how patience helped me.	6	8	14
17851	7	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Being patient is hard for some people but easy for others. I’m not a very patient person. I’ll tell about a time when I was patient. (the only time) One time me my mom and my sister we went to the docter because my sister had a docters appointment. I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said “about @NUM1 min.” @CAPS1 I said ok. @CAPS1 we arrived and she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no I’ll wait in the car. @CAPS1 I was inside of the car waiting and I got boare  and turned  the music on and this was ??? about @NUM2 or @NUM3 in. About @NUM4 later I got tired of listening to music. @CAPS1 I tried to fall asleep. That didn’t work @CAPS1 I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs were tight. It was @NUM5 and my mom and sister come walking. Thats a time I was patient.	8	8	16
17852	7	One day @CAPS1 went to school pretty earlie in the @TIME1. He went is just ?? if it were a normal day, and goes to his star class in the @NUM1 grade. He chated with his friends all star and then class was over. Then he goes to @NUM2 hour science and there is a lab with partners. @CAPS3 him and @PERSON2 decide to be partners. Half way through the lab they dont know what to do. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 goes up to the teacher and interupts her and another student. @CAPS3 the teacher says ill be with you in a moment, but he continues to bug her. @CAPS3 he got a step. Then later that day he was in @CAPS2 and was working on a work sheet but the teacher was writing with the principal. @CAPS3 he decided to wait for her to be done @CAPS3 he wouldn’t get in trouble, but it was taking much longer than expected @CAPS3 he noved th next problem’s. then the teach comes back and he got her help. @CAPS3 in conclusion @PERSON1 learned two lesson that day. One that you can get in trouble for being impatient and get a step. Two that if you are pollite and courtaeous in class and be patiet you can get the reward of getting a letter citizenship grade. Wich @PERSON1 did that day.	9	8	17
17859	7	Im writing about the time I was patient at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the @LOCATION1 vs. the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the @LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again.	9	8	17
17861	7	One when I was patient was when we were going of north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to mackinoc city from nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient.	8	8	16
17862	7	Patients is verey important. But I m not verey good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I m not verey patient because my family is not verey patient. My family is not verey patient because we just want to say what were gona say before we forget it. Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn. Thats all I know about patients.	5	4	9
17871	7	One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal.  As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain.’’ @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The dane’s rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6’s back turned.’’ @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. “@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased.’’ @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances.	12	12	24
17899	7	“@CAPS1! Look out!” @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. It’s unbearable to watch. Ambulences’ sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that’s @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I’d lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn’t know because in no way we we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. “@CAPS4”, @CAPS5 starts, “I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.” I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, “I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?” @CAPS5 didn’t have to explain any farther. “@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,” my voice caught in my throat, “just to get my stupid notebook.” A single tear weaved its way down my face. “@CAPS7, hunny!” my mother teared up as @CAPS6. “That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!” I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. “@CAPS8,” I said, regaining composure, “that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8.” @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. “I will wait then.” And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect.	12	12	24
17912	7	I want to say I found her, tex right away but I did’nt. I learned something though yeah it took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 intelligence) for me to piece it together. But love is, love is patient if you rtun to it it probably won’t stay with you but if wait and are patient maybe, just maybe it’ll come to you. I just have make sure I’m somewhere she can find me”. said church. @NUM1 year later. “@CAPS3 what’s thhhiiis.” @CAPS4 said “I know what this is” can I just shut the door for the night?” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. “ @CAPS6, Patience @PERSON1 were waiting for @CAPS7.”  @CAPS8 replied. “ @CAPS3 here he comes now” @CAPS10, @CAPS10.” @CAPS11 what I found I church. “@CAPS6” @CAPS4 you found the @CAPS1. Capture wait he’s in.” “do you think we have to wait for it to unlock.” When will it do that unlocky openy thing. I don’t know we will have to wait and see. That is if it will open.	4	8	12
17918	7	Patience is about waiting for something for a long  time. If you have patience that is good for you here is a time where i had patience. Last year in @DATE1 after school my dad and I went hunting for deer in @CAPS1. He went to this homeguards blind that we found sat in chair waiting for a deer to come along. You have to have patience while going  hunting . We didn’t see anything but then a deer came along and my dad he got ready and he said “cover your ear” then he shot  but we didn’t see any sign of deer blood  so he must have missed,then we packed up and went home.That is the time i had patience to go hunting with my dad but we didn’t get anything though.	8	6	14
17924	7	"I was patient for a whole @DATE1. Although, that was only because @CAPS2 mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the wii. For @CAPS5 had just come and had me interested the first time I saw @CAPS5. @CAPS5 was comoletely doctor and had advanced graphics.  I had informed  @CAPS2 mother about this system immediately.  ""@CAPS1, I will buy @CAPS5 for you, considering your report card was exceptional."" @CAPS2 mother had guarenteed me.  ""@CAPS3! Thanc you mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting @CAPS2 hopes up and expecting @CAPS5 within  @CAPS6 weeks. Although I had done that only to later on dissapoint myself. @CAPS2 mother had informed us that I was to get @CAPS5 in between the time period of one to  the months. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" I had shouted. "" @CAPS6 months?""  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS6 months I don't have enough time to thank about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" @CAPS2 mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in @CAPS2 entire life. After appioximontly one and a half months of waiting, @CAPS2 mother had finally and, ""@CAPS9 are going to @CAPS10 today to buy your wii"""". At that very moment. I led nearly exploded from happiness. ""@CAPS3! "" @CAPS12 I had started in do a dance that no one understood not even  me. So when @CAPS9 pulled up to @CAPS2 favorite video game retail store, I was so excited  I couldn't sit still.  ""@CAPS13 down! Geez, @CAPS5's just a video game system!"" I @CAPS12 stopped immediatly. ""That's what you @CAPS14."" I mumbled to myself. When @CAPS9 had returned home, I had kept playing until @TIME1. So that is when I learned  @CAPS5 pays off when your patient."	12	12	24
17955	7	A time when I someone I know was patient was when my mom heard that my aunt @PERSON1 was going to get married and @CAPS1 was helping plan it. @CAPS1 was patient because during the time of helping plan a wedding, @CAPS1 was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and was two months away from graduting from a @ORGANIZATION1 called @CAPS2’s @ORGANIZATION1, while taking care of a seven month old baby boy with the help of my dad and myself. Also, @CAPS1 was trying to get her parents here from @LOCATION2 , @LOCATION1 with a lot of other staff to do. After, two months of planning a wedding, taking excellent care of a new eight month baby boy, studying for a test, helping her parents, came here, and graduting. @CAPS1 was able to help plan a beautifullwedding on @DATE1. This is a time when someone I know was patient	12	8	20
17969	7	One time I was patient was when I was going to @LOCATION1 because the car ride was @NUM1 hours long. I was hungery, bored, and really needed to use the bathroom. I didn’t tell nobody because I knew we could not stop. I looked out the window but got bored. We were going to @LOCATION3, I was happy we stop and eat in @LOCATION3, I know that from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION3 is not a long way but hey I eat at @NUM2 and is like noon. We finally eat like having and hour in @LOCATION3. I did really good being paitent, because when I am unpaitent I get really mood and people don’t want to be with me when I’m mood.	8	8	16
17973	7	Last @DATE1 I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. And we drove for hours! O my go she butt hort! We got there and there were no packing spots, so we went to the back back lot! but then I was excited we were walking towards the park I was the wicked twister and surprised my @CAPS3 asked me to pick the first ride I said the wicked twister so we got in and I looked at the line for the wicked twister and guess what it took @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride I was so patient that day and then we cut the corner and there was like @NUM2 more people! So that day I rode almost all the rides in the park and ate a whole @NUM3 pound burgers fries and a shake! So theres my story about my patience!	7	8	15
17979	7	One day I was at home and I was getting ready to go and to eat and there was a very long  line so I was on the phone with @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 we were talking about the @CAPS1 test so then I said @CAPS2 why is this taking forever so they told me to be patient and until it’s time to order, so I said what does patient means they said it means to understand and be tolerant and do not complain so I said I might try that and then before I knew it I was sitting at a table eating and on the phone at red hobster. So now I know whenever I go somewhere with long lines all I have to do is be a lot more patient and dont complaine.	10	7	17
17983	7	Have you ever learn spritarnt just one turns in your life. I have let ??? you about it. One day I was at home watching too .all of a sudden I had to use the bathroom really bad. Unfortunately they my momma and my sisters had to go. My momma went first and my sister was going next. My momma didn’t take very long but my sister was in there while and I was getting mad but l still was waiting patiently. It was holding it in but I knew eventually I new that it was going to come out eventually, but just waiting. I was doing all I can to get in  the bathroom. I was banging on the door trying to just the back and I wait in the bathroom and handled my business. In conclusion, this is a time that I was patient.	8	10	18
18000	7	The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved foward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally the piolt got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward the plane’s wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendents helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I a reed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3.	10	12	22
18005	7	Patient ; When arriving to ceader point their was one ride it wated  to go on, that is the @CAPS1. The only problem is that it is a @NUM1 hour wait. Standing there in the blazing hot sun on @NUM2 @CAPS2  days I was  having second thoughts. Looking up and seeing the light and @CAPS3 difficult shades of green truck if the??? I knew it was worth it. After @NUM3 minutes @PERSON1 my brother was all ready board. So we played @NUM4 @CAPS4 to pass the time. I wore every time. Almost an hour later we get to the first pop and struck mageen. I get three pop and about @NUM5 cany bars @PERSON1 got double the around of me. Two hours later we got to the elevator was mouse bring us up it the??? At the top they strap us in to the frount row seat!  What our luck. Crank! Crank! Crank! Went the roller as to slowly truged up the hill. Then own cart dipled down and we were @CAPS2 going @NUM5 miles per hour we whent up, down, side, to side, me up site down??? three minutes. When we final pulled back into the station @PERSON1 had puched @NUM1 times and??? Meating my group back the car we began the @NUM8 hour car ride home and I turned to my brother and said it is another, so own game of @NUM4 @CAPS5 began.	11	9	20
18008	7	When I was in fourth grade and I was going to a concert and I had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long line to get in. While I was in line I started talking to my friends we played games and walked a few steps up every a minutes. I sat there and walked up with my mom and sat down again and it was just seemed like the line wasn’t moving at all! Finally we got up to the front and me and my friends were so excited. Being patient payed off because if I would have bothered my mom too much she might have gotten mat at me. I had a lot of fun after I got into then concert. That was a time that I was patient.	8	7	15
18018	7	I was patient when I had to witch @NUM1 little bad girls at my sisters house. My sister asked if I wanted to spend the @TIME1. I did then her god kids came over. That @TIME1 sister rembend she had to go some were. So that morning she left me with the kids for @NUM2 hours. So I had to wait patiently for her to come back. Finaly she did.	5	7	12
18028	7	One time it was hard to wait, but I was patient and in the end it was @CAPS1. One time my family and I were going to @CAPS2 world. The morning I woke up I was so excited because I really wanted to get the air port and go to @CAPS2 world @CAPS4 we packed to car we drove to the airport. In the car my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. Once we got to the airport we got supper excited! When we got to the area were you wait for your plane the workers told every one waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to @LOCATION1 was gonna be around one hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to @ORGANIZATION1 world as soon as we could, but we would just have to wait, we walked around the air port and, and got something to eat. Then @CAPS4 that we only had to wait twenty more minutes! My family and I just set down and talked and before we knew it we were  getting on the plane. Being patient can really help the soutition.	11	12	23
18031	7	Patience is a very long task @CAPS2 the rewards out weigh the time you waited for the thing you were waiting for. From waiting for a computer to start up to a line to a rollar coaster, your patience will be rewarded. However many people are not very patient. (@CAPS1 me) @CAPS2 they can learn over time to be as patient as monks. In short, be @CAPS1 a trile and lots of patience.	4	5	9
18040	7	One day I was at a baseball game in @LOCATION1 and the line was huge it stretch out for half a mile and we were at the end. So it took us about an hour to get up there so I had to be very very patient or else my dad would’ve gone crazy, so that’s my story about patience.	5	4	9
18044	7	Patience. My cousin ??? most patient person I have ever met. @LOCATION1 is studying to be a doctor, he must go through eight years of college. Eight years of termanology, teaching cells, learning human anology he has to be patient. My cousin goes to @ORGANIZATION1 which is pretty close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home a lot and never complain about homework or school or anything has got the highest patient ??? trust me. He is the perfect role model. Romeo is on his fifth year of college which means four down four to go. He doesn’t have a certain way of taking stress out besides the fact he squeezes his??? It’s not easy being motivated and relaxed ??? does that. Before he left for @ORGANIZATION1 he told me patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo is patient.	8	8	16
18053	7	I know a girl, she’s my friend, and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very good person. She eats all her veggies, does all her-home work, and has straigt A’s. @PERSON1 only has one problem. She is not patient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a saterday night so it was quite busy. There was a long line to @CAPS2 the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned. I told her, “@CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes.” @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms. “@CAPS2 over it you potato sak,” I told her. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around like she was in the worst case senerio. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, “@PERSON2, we gotta @CAPS2 to that counter before I explode!” I looked at her with my, why don’t you just shut-up, eyes. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 through out the night making sure she didn’t go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didn’t @CAPS2 kicked out. You should always @CAPS1 patient or things @MONTH1 turn out bad.	12	12	24

18117	7	Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patiences was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldn’t think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience.	8	11	19
18118	7	This was one day when I had to do something that I didn’t want to do and if I didn’t do it I couldn’t go no were or go to the movies.

18120	7	One time when I had to be patient was when I went to my first nascar race. I had to be patient because there wer a lot of people there on I didn`t want to get last. An I had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats. Second- we finally got our seats an I had to sit by this scary person he was weird so the race was beginning an you could tell because the racers were getting into there cars. The jets went over us and the @ORGANIZATION1 was going. Then the racers were off to race. Finally the race a starts on my favorite racer is in the lead (@PERSON1). The cars were going so fast around like you could feel the bleachers shake. It was a fun exsperense but you had stay close is listen and be patient.	10	8	18

Anna was one of the last gymnasts to go,only making her situation more difficult she took a deep breathe,and sat down patiently, waiting for her chance to shine to the judges	7	7	14
18138	7	"A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said her @CAPS1 was coming. @CAPS4 grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot of money. It is @NUM1 dollar. That was a lot of money. She @CAPS11't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I could not wait. So she was suppose to be coming on @DATE1. She didn't come. I was sick so I called @CAPS4 @CAPS2 at her job. I said, ""@CAPS2 why didn't @CAPS3 come."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said,"" @CAPS5 she is coming you just have to be patient."" @CAPS6, I said. Next day was @DATE2. ""@CAPS2 is she here yet"" I said. ""@CAPS8, @CAPS5 be patient she will be here tomorrow."" ""@CAPS6, I understand.""I gave up I thought that she was not coming. So @CAPS4 mom called @CAPS4 godmom. She said it was @CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I love @ORGANIZATION1. I so good. I asked @CAPS4 @CAPS2. ""@CAPS11 I have a @CAPS12. @ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger. I said @CAPS13 to @CAPS4 uncle and @CAPS4 mom said she was not coming. I told @CAPS4 mom I was not giving up she was coming. So I said I am hanging up. So I air hustled. @CAPS4 mom said to @CAPS4 uncle @CAPS14 ""should I get her something to eat. I thought she ment @CAPS4 grandmother. So I thought for a while her who is her. So I called back @CAPS4 mom said ohh I get food for uncle @CAPS14 dog. I said, @PERSON1's?  For a dog? She said know dog food. So @CAPS4 mom got me from @CAPS4 god mothers house I could not walk because @CAPS4 legs, back, arm and every part that I @CAPS11 move on @CAPS4 body hurt. So @CAPS4 grandmother came to her house because we have a keys. So she said where @CAPS16? @CAPS4 uncle whispered something and I said she here! Ran in @CAPS4 uncle room and hug her I said how are you because when I went for @CAPS4 grandmother birthday. She live in south caroline so yeah. The is @CAPS4 writing. That is when I was patient. So I could wait for @CAPS4 mom's @CAPS1."	7	5	12
18140	7	Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it. During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone. So she was phoneless for aleast three months. She was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. She was so glad, she had more apps then the first @CAPS1 and a webcom. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldn’t be able to wait that long.	9	9	18
18148	7	"Patience is basicly waiting and tolerating it. Every year on @MONTH1 @NUM1 my family become seasonal at a camp ground. There @CAPS1 play and have fan and make many life long friends. Every weekend @CAPS1 go out there and @CAPS1 take are speed boat, ""the glass from. ""@CAPS1 pat it into the the lake and dock it at a dock. Then @CAPS1 go fishing on every part of the lake and sit there for six hours. This is were patience comes in @CAPS1 have to sit and watch oar bobbers float on the smooth glass like lake. @CAPS1 sit there and watch and talk and bake in the sunlight. It is quite peaceful thowe that I'm off school and I @CAPS2 to spend time with my parents. Then in school I have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over. So @CAPS1 sit there until the sudden noise of on of our bobbers sinking into the water. After that theres some yelling and ""@CAPS2 the net ""sayings. The funny. Part is that it is that it is ethier a large bass or a small nor there. And all this takes patience."	10	8	18
18153	7	Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. “@CAPS1’s that?” I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2’t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “ro” and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom.	12	12	24
18159	7	A Time when I was Patient  A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step mom & brother. He was getting his knee looked at; @CAPS1 were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually I’m not very patient usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that I’m really impatient. For some reason when I’m really excited I’m fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient.	9	9	18
18161	7	When I was patient I had no fears no argument but I had a good deal .I had a @CAPS1  @CAPS4 was so good my sister @PERSON1 said “@CAPS2 I get some”  I said “ @CAPS3 you @CAPS2” @CAPS4 was a miracle so I was driving her car at the gasstation .I went to @ORGANIZATION1 .I said ,”@NUM1 @CAPS5 please “ @CAPS4 was a cousin of mine and she said ,” @NUM2 days ago “ I was like “ wow “ @PERSON1 called my phone because @CAPS4 was my daddy’s weekend she said ,” get down there now I was like  wow.	2	2	4
18166	7	“@CAPS1 @CAPS2” said my little sister @PERSON1 “@CAPS3 you help me practice kicking a soccer ball we are doing it in gym and I @CAPS6’t know how.” “Of corse” I said “lets go to the back yard” @CAPS4 my way out I grab a ball. I set it down @CAPS4 the ground in the front of me and say “@CAPS5 you do is step forward with you left foot and kick with the top of you right. “ I’ll try @CAPS8 say” daughtfully. @CAPS8 runs up to the ball an kicks, he misses but thats @CAPS7. @CAPS8 trys againe another miss. @CAPS8 sits down @CAPS4 the ground. I go up to her. “@CAPS6’t give its only your second try, not everyone is good at soccer try one more time. “@CAPS7, one more try.” @CAPS8 runs up to ball and kicks. The ball goes sailing into the goal. “@CAPS9 you for teaching me @CAPS2.” “I was my pleasure just try to be patient with yourself and you’ll be a great soccer player I promes.” “@CAPS7 but I want to practice some more.” “@CAPS7.”	8	9	17
18181	7	One day when I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited hours and hours and hours and hours then he said acler our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when is saw the dunes I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did. After I got to the top. I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like, a dead animal. After five minute I was good and climbing to the top dune off because after I got up I ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop I stop I stoped. But I got seed in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell, when my friend carte down we both lauphed and @CAPS2 back to our campsite.	9	8	17
18182	7	My name is @CAPS1 and I’m writing about a time I had be patient. It was a nice @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE2 it was the eighteenth and we were going to drive down to @LOCATION1 for a vaction we were going to  @CAPS2 land. Everybody was up in the house hold packing every thing into a hammer that we rented for the trip so every one would fite into the car. We had packed all things into the car. My made us a good breakfast. A hearty meal of sasauge pancakes and bacon and scaldded eggs. It was delicouse. After that we got into the car and we were on the highway I had fell a sleep a hour into the drive. By now it was ten acloak at night and I woke back up. My sister was yelling at my brother and then me and my sister got into a urgement my told all of use to be quited and we did but we were all get on each other nerves. And I had to be patient for another two day but we got there and I was glad to be there so overall it was a funture till we had to go back.	8	9	17
18189	7	Being patient is hard sometimes but easy others. Like @CAPS1 for example. I always get up really early on @CAPS1 morning and lay on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up round @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about @NUM2 am we start getting gosy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About @NUM3 am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about @NUM4 min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end.	11	11	22
18193	7	I don’t have much patience, but I’ll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was @DATE1 after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to landslide skate park. We were all at my home but @CAPS1 wasn’t. My mom said “@CAPS2 hes not here in two minutes we have to go with out him”. So I was mad I was writing a note to put on the door that reads “@CAPS1, we had to go with out you because you were late! Sorry be on time next time.-@CAPS4”. But when I was signing the note he pulled up. That was the story when I had patients.	6	9	15
18200	7	"Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up wen she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too. She put on my chest to see if my heart was @CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine. So i trusted her she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm it sorta hurt like a pinch then @NUM2… @NUM3… @NUM4… and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube really cool then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which  took about a year not really could not tell by her expression then she said no and that was so happy and I was being patient which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and seeing myself!"	11	8	19

18246	7	I @DATE1, my family took a trip to @ORGANIZATION1. After @CAPS3 got to the airport @CAPS3 had to wait a long time. So  there @CAPS3 are on the airport, about to leave to go to @LOCATION1 when are flight is delayed because a early morning thunderstorm rolled in. @CAPS6 took forever, every minute seemed like an hour, @CAPS1 after  half an hour I asked for some money to get some breakfast but of course my mom said, “@CAPS2.” I was about to lose @CAPS6 when this guy came over the speaker, “@CAPS3 will have to delay the flight to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 a little longer.” @CAPS4 when I rember that I have a @CAPS5 in my bag and I go to turn @CAPS6 on and @CAPS6’s dead. Then after an hour the storm stopped and @CAPS3 were able to board the plane. From that day I found out I’m not a pacient person.	9	8	17
18254	7	A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I wanted my party to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no. @CAPS1 the party came I got all my presents’ exept the ones from my parents. They said @CAPS1 everyone left they would give them to me. But no one left till ten. So I fell asleep. When I wook up no one was up. So I still had to wait. (I hate waiting.) @CAPS1 my mum got up I asked if I could open my presents she said wait till your father gets up. @CAPS1 my dad finally got up (@NUM1) I finally got to open my presents. It was worth the wait.	7	10	17

18267	7	Patience can really help you in life some times it’s the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important. Just like how my dog ran away and I’m waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you'll get in a sitchation were your waiting for someone but there is always only one choice, to wait or be patient.	6	5	11
18268	7	I like bilding a house or a puzzle. Becouse it takes time to do puzzels it takes dedication hard work and patients to complet a house. If you have no patients then it is harder to complet when you just get board of it.	4	4	8
18277	7	A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient excepcially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patient because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and their were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines where long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn’@CAPS1 mine. I went back drank my pop and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient.	9	9	18
18280	7	One time I went to the doctors. The docter said to wait in this room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said a nother docter will come in. we waited three hours in that room. My mom was mad, they forgot about us. The docter that was spose to come in went in the wrong room. The worst part was I had to get three shots and I hate shots. In conclusion. I learned my mom is not that patient and I got ice cream after the docters so patience always has a reward.	8	8	16
18284	7	Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life.	5	6	11
18297	7	"Do you ever fell like your @CAPS1 is going to expload? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how l felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that l want to expload. The story starts at @TIME1pm my brother @LOCATION2 just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so I looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister @PERSON2, and my friend @LOCATION1 came up from behind me and stopped @PERSON2 said ""I didnt want you to walk to get @LOCATION2 by urself"" so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called @LOCATION2 and said we didnt see him and it was already @NUM1 he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door @PERSON2, and savanah were already at the party store @LOCATION1 questioned me and asked ""@CAPS2 did it take you so long"" I told her what happened as @PERSON2 pushed the @PERSON1 and savanah rode on the handle bars. In my @CAPS1 l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. The lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again."	12	9	21
18317	7	It was the day of central @LOCATION1 and it was after school that I was in the paraid with my football team and the line was going really slow and eventally we have done and it was off the home with my best friend @PERSON1. Well his preparing me and I went to his house and played a little and then we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1’s there were about @NUM1 cars and they were all in the drive through and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game didn’t start until @NUM2 and it was @NUM3. So we sat there patiently and ordered are food and left to go to the football game. And that’s a time when I was patient.	8	8	16
18324	7	It was a nice sunny day outside, in the middle of the @DATE1. It was so hot outside, it was like the sahara desert. “honey get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,” my mom shouted out the window. “@CAPS1 mom,” I questioned.”it’s a suprice”she answered. So I did what she told me while wondering where @CAPS9 were going. When @CAPS9 got there, I knew exactly where @CAPS9 were. @STATE1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. “@CAPS3 going to go on @CAPS4 @CAPS5, want to come,” I asked my mom. “@CAPS6, sounds like fun she replied.” When @CAPS9 got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. “@CAPS7, I don’t want to wait mom, its too long of a line,” I complained. “@CAPS8 patient, sweety @CAPS9’ll @CAPS8 on the coaster in no time,” she replied. One hour later……… “mom its taking forever.” I whimpered. “@CAPS9 are the next ones in line,” she replied still smiling. So when the gates opend i was so excited and nervous, I couldn’t believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. “You were very patient,” my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. “@CAPS6 I was, and @CAPS3 proud of that,” I said to myself.	12	12	24
18333	7	A time I was patient was when I went to get my teath cleaned than ??? that i went  to doctors. I waited  three (@NUM1 )hours  to get my teath cleaned and that was hand so I took a book out to read than when I was on reading the book about @NUM2 ½ times I got called to get my teath cleaned, after that  I went to the doctors to get wald, medisan refilled and get some shoes. I had to wait for about two (@NUM3) hours before getting called into the room, but than I waited @NUM4 so they could get the shots ready. So I waited about five hours and five minutes, after all that time I finally went to eat some lunch at @ORGANIZATION1. That was all I did that day.	10	6	16
18340	7	Havening a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know some one who does” well that’s exacually what I am going to be talking about in my own way. Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience. Everybody always woundered about her there was something special about her. One day her and her family was going out and she couldn’t wait but you know what she had patience. Also she wanted to go get something from the store, @LOCATION1. She wasn’t like other children, couldn’t wait and always bother her parents she just sat patiently. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2’s too. She couldn’t wait to leave but you know what got her, patience in the store and get that pacific thing she wanted. When they got in the store she finally got what she wanted it was just lips glass five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was nearly to go then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience when they got home she was so tired and she wen’t up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait, that’s how accedents and problems happen and this little girl got every thing she wanted one thing, she had patience.	10	6	16
18362	7	Melted @CAPS1 One day @CAPS13 sister and I have just woke up one bright @DATE1 @TIME1. @CAPS5 was at @CAPS13 door. The light shinned through @CAPS13 cartains and @CAPS13 covers. @CAPS5 pushed the door open just a crack and said, “@CAPS2” “@CAPS3”, I got up moaning “@CAPS4 me up. I’m sleeping.” @CAPS5 helped me up and hugged me while I was searching, I went in to the living room. @CAPS5 were in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but @CAPS19 was aluminium. Dazed, I turned on the tv when I didn’t know @CAPS13 mom was on the coach. “@CAPS6, go put the clothes in the diver”, called ?? “@CAPS7.K.” I ??, “(@CAPS8 want to come down stairs to.” “@CAPS9” he exclaimed. “@CAPS10’ I thought in @CAPS13 head. We walked down stairs in the ??? to the laundry room when we finished putting the clothed in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said “Do you smell that?” @CAPS5 look frightened and said “@CAPS9 I’m cooking something. “@CAPS13 eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened @CAPS19 and @CAPS14 pushed me out side hare coms. “@CAPS10 air!” we m joined. We were back in and crawled through the kitchen. We paused to stare at the fire; we ran towards @CAPS17 still on the couch sleep. We shook her and shook her but @CAPS5 didn’t wake up, so I said “cover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!” “@CAPS16 wrong with ya’ll!” @CAPS17 yelled. “The @CAPS1, fire, @CAPS18 @CAPS19!” I screamed. @CAPS5 stood, we ran, @CAPS5 grabbed a cup of water and poured @CAPS19 on the @CAPS1. “I need to teach you how to cook better or until you won’t set any thing on fire!” I said.	12	12	24
18368	7	Once apani time there were to kids one was name @CAPS1 he wasn’t patience at all. The other kid was name @PERSON1 he be was patience. They went for a walk in the woods and get lost @CAPS1 would not stop complaining. @PERSON1 told him stop complaining @CAPS3 @CAPS1 didn’t until he say a hunted house @CAPS1 told @PERSON2 want to go inside with him. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 didn’t want to go in so @CAPS1 went in and act like he got hurt so @PERSON1 ran in there the dorslamd shut and the door nob feel off. They were scared it was dark. Then the light came on. @CAPS1 said lets get at of here! @PERSON1 said how the door nob fell off. @CAPS1 said I don’t know they ran though the house there wore no other door or windows the were terrify then a ghost was coming at them and he said happy @CAPS7 it was there dad he built the house for them and said all you had to do is push the door open. and they all went home. the end	7	8	15
18371	7	This is a story about a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient is when I was at food store waiting for my food. I ordered my food and they took olday to give it to me . I waited so patient. Other people was ??? in ???  there ??? they still did not give me mine, so I went outside and told my granddad that they were about to give me my food . I told him that because he kept asking me why they are taking so long. So I went back in the food store and asked them why are you taking so long, they said it’s coming in a second. Then I set down in the food store and I looked and so my friends coming into the food store. So we started talking and waiting patient for are food. Their names are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @PERSON1. My name is @CAPS3, I was born in @DATE1 , I was raised in the city of @LOCATION1 oit. I was patient because I did not get angry and I waited. So then they called my name and said my food was ready. Then I got my food and told my friends I’m about to go home, after that I left. Thats a story about a time when I was patient.	10	8	18
18375	7	A time when I had to be patient was my @NUM1 birthday. Why because I was wait for my phone and mom cep telling that I was going to get it on the frist of @DATE1. But I still didn’t belive her and guess what my last present was my brand new cell phone& a case now that is wat I call pacent.	4	4	8
18378	7	Jenny and @PERSON3 were twins brother and sister every year a carnival was built up next to their house with games, rides and food. One day @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 went to ask their mother @PERSON2 politely for some money to go on the ferris wheel mom, “can we each have a dollar to go on the ferris  wheel.” @CAPS1 @PERSON1,”sure “ @CAPS1 mom and handed them two dollars. @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 were so excited they ran to the line of the ferris wheel. They waited and waited for an hour and it was finally their turn, during this time for man that was in charge of the ferris wheel had watched @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 wait in line. As @PERSON1 were about to step in the cast to mean boys pushed them off to the ground and took their seat. Now mama taught them how to be nice to everyone and they remembered that so they got back up and let them go. When it was their turn again the man in charge of the ferris wheel took notice of what just happened and told them that he was proud of @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 and that they would go around the ferris wheel thrice more for their patients. After the ride, they thanked the man and ran happily home to tell their mom what happened their mama was so proud of them and hug @PERSON1 and @PERSON1.	8	10	18
18379	7	I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off.	7	4	11
18404	7	A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the year of the seventh grade. It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and sayed there was a delay. So as the rest of the class complained I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though so I just kept my cool. Then eventually our grade was called downs to have lunch. That the time when I was patient over something.	8	8	16
18411	7	I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework. Some of them take awhile to explain to and I must use patience in order to help them. And I'll be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and get frustrated easily, like me sometimes. And at times I have been on the phone for a hour trying to explain homework to one of my friends. Soon I will once again have patience when I tutor for @CAPS1. To me patience is one of the most important characteristics someone can have.	5	5	10
18416	7	One time when I was patient was when my mom’s car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend that lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited an hour and a half waiting on her. My mom called called her back and she said she can’t make it because she needed an oil change. After that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, it picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked the rest of the way to @NUM1 mile and @PERSON1 where the was another bus that took us to @NUM2 mile and @PERSON1 where my school is. That was time when I was patient.	11	8	19
18418	7	Paitience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone or for something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but momdid not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said wait a little while be paitient.” I went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker. I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles.	9	9	18
18429	7	Patience. Patience is something I have absolutly nothing of! I take after my mom in this area. My mom is probably a little bit worse than me but we are both pretty bad. Sometimes we record t.v. shows and watch them later just because we don’t want to have to wait through the @CAPS1. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes any  longer than that puts me over the edge. On by the way another thing is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a @NUM1 hour drive turn into a @NUM1 minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish icould have more patience but I don’t know how to get it. I really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story.	7	8	15
18430	7	One time I had to be really patience. It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs.	10	9	19
18446	7	When I'm being a patient and I @CAPS1 nicely and I do not complain and I like to be pation and I @CAPS1 good I do not fell and sometimes people don't be them to calm down and sometimes when something is is taking forever I sometimes sat come on and I always be patent at school at restaurants and I always be patent ever I where bat sometimes I can't not be patent and I don't want people thanking  I m weird of ating  some thing I just @CAPS1 a neit it and I be patent in lines at the fail and at the fair sometimes have long lines and that is my goal is being patent of everything but sometimes I'm not patent because sometimes  something take to long and I just like to be patent.	3	4	7
18448	7	In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didn’t get to sleep in very much, I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasn’t going with us. We got in the car, and drove to my uncle @PERSON1’s house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1’s old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching  the boat. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. “@CAPS1” my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life!! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight.	9	10	19
18459	7	My mom woke me up early in the morning and said I need to get up and get ready fast. I asked what was the matter and she said were going to potter park zoo. I @CAPS5’t know why mabe just a sudden idea. I got all dressed and we hit the road. I wasn’t felling well that morning. We got subway breakfast. I didn’t eat my sandwitch tho cause my stumic hurt to bad. It seemed like @NUM1 hours befor we finily got there. I was felling better now. We paid a got a map and stanted  looking at all the awsome animals. I got to see @NUM1 giant wolfs, snakes, monkeys, lions, pekos, camels, and a @CAPS1 of other animals. It was so fun! We got to this bind cage that you can go in the birds are just flying around lose! There was a little boy in there and a bind landed right on the top of his head! @CAPS6 my mom’s phone rang. It was my brother. He said home because he didn’t wanna get up. I could barlley hear my mom over the birds. She walked out and stood outside I followed her she was saying “@CAPS2 @CAPS3, because I said so you @CAPS5’t need to go any where.” @CAPS4 thing I know she was hanging up. We walked toward the fish building when her phone rang. “@CAPS5’t ever hang up on me agian! @CAPS3, I @CAPS5’t need to fight with you! Its going to storm I want you home!” @CAPS6 it starts poring rain and my moms still on the phone. I was getting very wet and board I really wanted to see the fish. About @NUM3 minutes later my mom hung up her phone. We walk in soken wet! My mom smiled at me and said “@CAPS7 for being so patient!”	10	8	18
18465	7	One time I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor to take my shot for six grade. I didnt want to go but I had to go I didnt have a choice so I get in the car and we drive to the doctors office. Finally we arrived. My mom had to sign in and we sat down.

( more her than me) @CAPS1 all at started on a @DATE1 @TIME1 my family went to go do some drink (I stayed behind to work on my homework) A little after my mom left I heard a knock on the door.  My aunt come in and whispered ""you most??? @CAPS1 was okay is if I left @CAPS2"" @CAPS3 I replied  ""okay"" @CAPS4 was asleep for about half- an hour. When I woke up @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 started crying. First thing I did was pick her up and carry her around. Still @CAPS4 was crying! @CAPS3 I thought her cloth need changing. I changed her cloth and??? Keeps crying. Now I had to keep my patience though because who would yell at a baby. Then I thought @CAPS4 was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle though @CAPS3 I had to read??? (@CAPS4 had no patience all @CAPS4 want was  her bottle) @CAPS5 when I was about to lose my patience I made a bottle bat sure if @CAPS1 was good) but @CAPS4 drank @CAPS1. Finally I put her back to sleep (if @CAPS4 cried one more time. I would do finally lose my patience) @CAPS6 @CAPS4 was sleeping @CAPS4 looked in peaceful until @CAPS4 woke up. @CAPS4 started crying again (this time I knew why because @CAPS4 likes to be carried).By the time my aunt came back my hands hare sore. Although at the end of the day I figured out, that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby you need way more patience for a younger brother though trust me)."	9	12	21
18497	7	"@PERSON2, get down here I need you to open an evelope! My mom said.

18500	7	I was patient when it was my birthday and I didn’t get anything. I thought I would get at least one thing but I got nothing. I didn’t do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing I didn’t ask for anything but I still got nothing. The next day I got nothing. But that night while it was skating at skate port @NUM1 got nothing. Like at @TIME1 I saw my cousin and she gave me @MONEY1 for my birthday. I thought that everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so happy too. I had to be patient in order to get something and don’t have to ask for something.	12	8	20
18503	7	One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!	8	8	16
18515	7	@PERSON1 and his dad were planning on going fishing on that @DATE1 @TIME1. They got everything they needed fishing pots. Tackle box, fishing nets, bait, and lunch. They drove down to the lake, got into their small rowboat and were off. @PERSON1's dad was the first to catch something. He caught a ten inch small mouth bass. It was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet today. There was a small breeze in the @DATE2 air. The sun was up but it was still a little cold. The sat there quietly, patiently. @PERSON1's dad got another pull on his line. He quickly reeled it in. this time he caught a twenty inch pike. Another one too small so he threw it back. ''The fish are really biting today hu?'' said his dad. But the truth was they had been out there for an hour and @PERSON1 hadn't gotten a bite. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch. They just brought sand wiches, chips, and a few waters. When they were done eating they went back to fishing. @PERSON1 casted his line as far as he could get it to go. He sat and waited for about twenty minutes when he finally got a tug on his line. ''I got one. I got one,'' he told his dad trying to reel his line in as fast as could. When he got it in the boat, they measured it. @PERSON1 caught a fourteen inch largemouth bass. ''@CAPS1 like you caught dinner for tonight ''. Said his dad. They stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in with a fish dinner @PERSON1's patients caught him a good fish.	12	12	24

I had my I-pod, a book, and the @CAPS1 in front of me. Once we were in the air I thought I would take a nap. But that only killed a hour so then I decided to watch a movie. I watched @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That took off another two hours. By then I was starting to get bored. I decied I would read. But after an hour and – a – half I finished the book. Then my I-pod come out. I listened to music until lunch came a hour later. After eating lunch which took @NUM3 minutes I decided to watch another movie. I watched @CAPS4 @CAPS5 which killed off enough @NUM4 hours. Then with only @NUM4 hours left I wanted to watch season @NUM6 of the office. Then when there was only @NUM7 minutes left when they cut everything down I watched us land in @LOCATION1. It was long but I was patient and stuck through it.	10	11	21

18594	7	When I was patient. Their was a time when I was patient. Their are more and more way’s I get @CAPS1 patient when I’m not in no hurry to do something. I’m going to tell you a true story when I was patient. And I was not in a hurry in get it done. My first day at school and we was having fun with a bunch of people and on that first day we had work. When we attended to do it some people was not patient. I looked around the bright room and I was thinging about how should I be patient, “@CAPS1 I said” to myself I have to take the time @CAPS1 I could reach a good grade and @CAPS1 I was patient. The next day I was ready to see my grade on that work. I had a fun that’s the day when I was patient and taking my time.	9	8	17
18604	7	I must admit there are times when I’m not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was.I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My told me to be patient but I didn’t know what that meant so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, “You have to wart quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told her. I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also.	9	12	21
18605	7	Being patient isn’t that hard if you try. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for ???. Five minutes past and they still weren’t don so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still weren’t done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done ??? was only two minutes. ??? well I guess I give it another try and if I still don’t get I’ll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasn’t making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said that we didn’t have to do that one and I laughed and told her ??? figure it out all yesterday. That is an example of bein patient	10	12	22
18608	7	"@LOCATION1 @CAPS10 sit down, my friend says. You don't need to be moving around like your a fly on tha wall."" I sit down anxious to get up and move again."" @CAPS1 's too many people here we're never getting in."" I say. The line was the longest to get my driving test, so @CAPS2 thinking to myself to get up and move around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend think its annoying and awkward. ""@LOCATION1, I wonder if they had a vending machine here."" ""I doubt @CAPS1,"" I proclaim. @CAPS3 glance at me and I turn away. I got up and I walked away. I came back @TIME1 and @CAPS3 was gone. I sat down and talked on the phone for a @CAPS13 @NUM1 I sat and looked at everyone wandering who to talk to because I was bored. I wanted to get up so bad and move around but I would look and @CAPS10 walking in a circle and plus @CAPS4 left. I sat and wait @NUM2 @TIME1 past and @CAPS1 was getting close to @NUM3.m. @CAPS1 was @CAPS5 @NUM4 and I'm @NUM5 so I knew I was next. ""@CAPS5 @NUM5 your next."" I think in my head like ""@CAPS6."" I get up and walk to the teller. ""@CAPS7 you for your patience, now @CAPS12 can I help you"" I looked at her and said, ""@CAPS8 I would like a driving test please."" When I got my paper to go in I thought to myself that I wasn't patient couse @CAPS1 seem like I was there for like a cazillion hours. I though again and think @CAPS8 @CAPS11 I was patient @CAPS1 was probably @CAPS3 that made me impatient because I had no one to goos off with. So @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I @CAPS6 was patient in like forever but I did @CAPS13 because I was ready to leave. ""@CAPS12 was wait? The driver ad teacher says."" @CAPS13 I felt patient enough to be there for about @NUM7 hours. This is the time I never knew but know I was patient enough to wait."""	10	6	16
18619	7	Once in @NUM1 grade my teacher @PERSON1 “asked us to get an A.M.P out.” @CAPS1 we all did and quietly we started to work. All of a sudden I was on my last prebblem and I was thinking “man already to the end.” @CAPS1 I started to work on it I was @CAPS1 confused this probblem was like seventh grade work. @CAPS1 I rased my hand and waited to go on @PERSON1 my hand and told me to go on in my math but I told her “I can’t go on I am on my last problem.”  @CAPS2 @PERSON1 went on helping all of the other students and I was waiting and waiting. Finally after she went to eight other people she came and helped me. She showed me how to do the problem and I figured it out. That was the time I waited patiently.	8	10	18
18630	7	This is a time I was patient. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 on my birth day, we had @NUM1 boys at my house. We all wanted to play xbox. (@ORGANIZATION1.core @NUM2). Only have @NUM3 controllers.

18645	7	Being patient is a good thing. Sometimes impatient @CAPS1 sometimes im not its better to be patient. My cousin is patient so when I tell her to wait and be patient she will wait as long as she want. My other causins tell me to be patient and I will just be waiting for a while and I ask then hurry and they tell me to learn to be patient. My cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient and we tRied. So now I can stay longer being patient.	4	5	9
18663	7	Hi my name is @PERSON1 and I’m going to tell you a story about how one time I was patience. I remember when I was patience. It was chismis day. There was tons and tons of precidens under the tree. There was tiny ones all the way to hamuges ones. But I couldn’t even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up. I wanted to go into my mom’s and dad’s room and wake them up. But no without some brekfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so can open my precidens. After my mom and dad were done eating I finally got to open my precidents.	8	8	16
18678	7	The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you don’t ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you don’t get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you don’t get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you don’t get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosn’t pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something that’s a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because, if you maybe wan’t to have a job as a theropist you need a lot of patients. Those are some definitions of patients.	5	6	11
18694	7	Frezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk with themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and @CAPS7 hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tooth time. “@CAPS4, I got it!” @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say joining them into my pockets. “@CAPS6, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said, “@CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”	8	12	20
18706	7	Patience is truly the hardest thing and body really ? that a ?.I hard to because im on punishment for not doing what I was suporse to do. So I have to be patient it and what it out until it was being patient it is what for a perfect of team to did. From my pop it of how. So while im on punishment I just waiting it out so my time will come because I can’t speed up there and just make it ??? quicker but it  I could  I would but  for now I have to want. Im a permanent for quite a while so I can just be patient .I know before taking it hard but most people have to do it because rushing is most likely not the way to do it patience also helps the maker  and cam saved you time. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can want for certainly things like; money, clothes, shoes, homes, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, car (transportation, and things of the sudn because at you post rush every thing you want get it the way you were surpose to but waiting and being patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be!	4	4	8
18707	7	As I sit in the waiting room at @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 waiting and waiting for my grandpa to come to thee recovery room.

Then I say to my @CAPS3 “can we see grandpa now”, she said “@CAPS4 just be patient everything will be just fine if you sit relax and for hevan sakes,” “be patient!” “@CAPS5” I say to my @CAPS3. After an hour passed, I had gotten on say so I thought in my self and said to myself cahlem and patient, calm and patient. Then this lady come out to the waiting room and said “the surgery was a little longer than we expected but everything went perfectly fine but he will be staying in the hospital for a week an a half at the most “which was perfectly fine with me as long as I was get out of this boring hospital and as soon as I said I had my mom said as soon as grandpa gets to the recovery room we will go see him then we will leave!	8	12	20
18714	7	ON @DATE2 I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldn’t get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasn’t doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her I’m fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn’t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids but her self and @NUM2 of them is hises.  But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. But beening @CAPS1 I didn’t want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all here stuff she looked pretty everything went while but know on on we still cry in think about her. Then that was a time I didn’t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone.

But into this day I can’t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 forgotten.	6	8	14
18730	7	@NUM1 Patience is when you understand and you donâ€™t complain. A person who is patient is some     one who can wait and they donâ€™t while every two second. A person like that can succeed in life. @NUM2 @CAPS1! @PERSON2 was getting was getting closer. First @PERSON6 then @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @PERSON7. She was coming town my row next. This was a night more. When is someone going pinch me go I wake up. @NUM3 â€œ@PERSON5.â€ @PERSON3 and with a disappointed force â€œ@CAPS2 did a poor set on this festâ€. I think you should pet on. In my mind I was praying for her not to say the word, she responded, â€œ@CAPS3.â€ When I got home my mom mad the letter and agreed with it. Why did I have to fall history. Next week the out or came. We sat down she was about to say something so I took a deep breath, you have to be patient and no complaining. I nodded my head with a smile so big with looked like my lips were about to fall off. @NUM4 A few weeks later. I got a little better every day. Her name was @PERSON4. She was very nice and thoughtful. She told me I was progressing by waiting and seeing the results. Finally the hundred points there came. I was nervous but confident at the same time. That test is going in wish it he met me! A week later @PERSON1 passed @PERSON6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 and @PERSON7. A smile on her face good job @PERSON5 you got an A-. It was hard in the begging but I was patient and I got a good grade. @NUM5 wait and donâ€™t hag and see the results of the end. Patience helped me because I know in the future to be tolerant. A person who is patient is a person who accomplishes a goal.	9	9	18
18740	7	"The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This important because it actuly makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patient. @CAPS5 were loading up for a three-hour drive to the @CAPS1 water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents.

Of course my brother @CAPS2 was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until @CAPS3 finaly couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" @CAPS3 exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" @CAPS3 was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than @CAPS3 had. Which tells you a lot?Tyler comes out @NUM1 minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another @NUM2 minutes which my brother mad. ""@CAPS4 took you so long?"" @CAPS3 asked. ""@CAPS5 had to make sure uncle @PERSON1 was ready to leave."" my dad awnsered. As soon as @CAPS5 got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least @CAPS5 were all patient, except for my brother @CAPS3's still like that now."	9	11	20
18741	7	Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I can’t tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didn’t mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether it’s a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around.	12	12	24
18748	7	Patience, having patience means you don’t complain about things that take long amounts of time. You are tolerant, or understanding. Some reasons why you should @CAPS7 patience are things like .  You @CAPS7 @CAPS8 wait in a extremely long line and the whole time you are waiting you say things like, “ @CAPS1, this takes @CAPS5.” Or, “ @CAPS1, when @CAPS3 @CAPS6 leave.” @CAPS3’t @CAPS6 just @CAPS9?” Your @CAPS1 would be thinking, “ @CAPS4 my gosh would you just stop talking?” Or she would just want @CAPS8 scream. So your @CAPS1 probably wouldn’t ever want @CAPS8 take you somewhere that involved waiting ever again because she knows that you are @CAPS8 impatient @CAPS8 handle it. Some reasons why maybe you wouldn’t want @CAPS8 be patient or you would wan’t @CAPS8 be inpatient could be like if you had a meeting with your teacher and if you were late then you would @CAPS7 a bad first impression.So your @CAPS1 is taking @CAPS5 talking on the phone so you keep saying,’’@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9,@CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9!” @CAPS10 you wait very impatiently. Although, patience is basically like a kind , gentle way of waiting. Even though on the inside, your picturing yourself screaming at someone who you’re waiting on. Where on the outside, you are patiently waiting. So, having patience is a good thing. Try, it sometimes just don’t let your feelings on the inside tear apart what is happening on the outside.	7	9	16
18750	7	A time when I was patient was when @CAPS1 came. And I was getting hungry so I went inside and asked when is dinner @CAPS2? And @CAPS3 and hour.	2	4	6
18764	7	A time when I was patint is when I was at the fastifal. I whanted to get something to eat and the line was big. Another time is when I wanted to get on a ride the line was giantle large. It was for the @CAPS1, @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 pirate ship, the swing. There was a line to play this baskeball game it was big.	3	6	9
18789	7	One day my brother, my mom and me were going to the doctor’s because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctor’s office’s and sat in the waiting area. They called my mom and brother. So I had to stay. My mom told it will only take two minutes. Guess what she was wrong. It took her two hours to come back. So while I was patient I texted my aunt and friends. I also played some games. I actually brought my @CAPS1 with me. So I waited and waited. I was so bored I went outside for some fresh air. Then I got tired I just sat there. Finally they came out. Guess what my mom said “how are you sweety”, then my mum told me my brother was sick. I was so patient that we got to eat at @ORGANIZATION1. after the ??? I was patient at the clinic so then we spent @NUM1 minutes. Here so I ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? to sleep. I was ??? ??? Because I was patient its not that ??? believe ??? its actually easy. That’s a ???	10	9	19
18800	7	One time when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I had to wate about @NUM1 hours to go on the top thrill dragster. I was so patient because it was my first time ever going on the dragster. Me and my dad were wating and wating. When we got to the front of the line I was so scared that I was going to pee my pants. When we got on the rollercoaster I said that I don’t want to go. So my dad asked if my son could get off the rollercoaster and they said when you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it and when I did I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was a @NUM2 second ride it was the best thing that I had ever wated for in my life so far. That is the time when I had to be patient to get something that I really wanted.	9	8	17
18802	7	Do you know someone who is patient? I do my mom is vary patient with us kids.  When I just blow my top my mom is still cool. All the time my littlel borther makes me so mad that I can’t stand it. But she barly over is like that. Even when my grandma died she stayed cool. Two of my ants just brock. down that week. But thir good now. Every day thing don’t make her vary uptite. When my sister makes her mad she always regrets it. I whant to punch her when she mackes mom mad because it wares off on me she crancke. So as you can see my mom ceps her patients so well.	6	5	11
18806	7	A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at @ORGANIZATION1 vaction. I was having a blast. My family didn’t come because they don’t like roller coasters. We dicided to ride the @CAPS1, it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the @CAPS1. We really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth waiting @NUM1 and a half hours @ORGANIZATION1 it and we even went on it twice.	8	12	20
18815	7	Sometimes being patient is hard @CAPS5 I’ve had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I’ve always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see @CAPS3 my presents @CAPS5 their were none. My mom was just watching @CAPS1.V. like nothing was important and I said to her, “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 she said back was “@CAPS2, why are you up this early?” I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, @CAPS5 nothing. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until @NUM1, just waiting for someone to say “happy birthday” @CAPS5 yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until @NUM2: pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient I got a good party and now I’m patient every day.	9	8	17
18839	7	“@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon don’t worry,” @CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaing. Well over these few days (which feels like cons) I have not been this so called “@CAPS3” person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didn’t come in the mail. I’ve been waiting and waiting but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fith time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didn’t. “I’ve been sitting here since ten o’clock where is the @CAPS4 track!” I scream. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! “@CAPS5 coming” I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white @CAPS6-@CAPS7  truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 that’s it!) @CAPS9 to gaze. Nope it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps.” @CAPS10!” I sob in agony, “ why does this feeling consume me like this?” I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. “ @CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here!” I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally!	12	10	22
18849	7	A time when I was patient was just yesterday. I had just finished part @NUM1 of the rest and I was very anxious and I wanted to get up and more around, but were taking the @CAPS1 so I could not. Instead I entertaind myself in any way I could such as pretend singer writing running songs through my head repeatedly, even twiddling my thumbs! So finally she let us get and talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends so I just talked to them. Somehow we got into talking about dangeons and dragons, they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. anyway I kept trying too talk but I keep geting interupted so I just relaxed and waited for my turn. Finnaly it was my turn to talk, but we had to go to lunch so I never did get to say what mine was.This is a time when I was patient.	8	10	18
18859	7	Patience is something or someone who like waiting for someone or something patience part of life I sometime don’t have patience but I should have patience without patience you will get not because something in lift you have to want for and that is why you should have patience.	3	3	6
18868	7	Being patient @CAPS4 a great trait to have. When you are patient you are respected. That @CAPS4 why I have alot of respect for @CAPS7 teacher. @PERSON1. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 a very patient person. If you didn’t understand something she will work through it with you until you understand. Even it takes a couple of weeks. One time she was teaching us how to add negative numbers and I didn’t understand and she worked with me until I understood. She was very patient. Let me tell you what happened. “@CAPS1 class today we are going to add negative numberC” @CAPS2 @CAPS4 going to be a breeze I thought silently to myself. Little did I know I would not know what to do at all and @CAPS7 teacher was going to have to be very patient with me. When @CAPS7 teacher was done explaining the rules to adding negative numbers I was already lost “ @CAPS3 are some sample problems that everyone needs to try,” said @CAPS7 teacher. A few minutes later she went to every student and checked there answers. When she got to me she had a worried expression on her face. “@CAPS4 everything all  right you didn’t do your sample problems” she asked me. “I dont understand @CAPS2” I replied. @CAPS7 teacher fell silent for a moment and then she said “come see me after class” @CAPS5 I waited until the end of the day and then went to see her. “I noticed you were having trouble with math today” said @CAPS7 teacher. “@CAPS6 were gonna fix that.” @CAPS7 teacher sat down with me and explained what to do in steps. After about twenty minutes of her explaining to me how to do it I finnaly began to pick it up. @NUM1 minutes later I was doing it. “You can go now” said @CAPS7 teacher. “You now understand it better than the other students.” “thanks for being @CAPS5 patient with me” I said before I left . @CAPS7 teacher just smiled. That was a time when @CAPS7 teacher was very patient with me. And I am glad that she was	12	12	24
18877	7	When I went to the @CAPS1 conly @ORGANIZATION2 for youth group at my church I took some o my friend. In the maze we had to go as a group of @CAPS2 & me, my dad, @PERSON1, & @CAPS3 went in one group @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 in the group be hind us. Half way thru the @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2 there was a guy casing us with a chain saw & then @PERSON1 smacked my glass of my face so we had to stop that @ORGANIZATION2 of the @ORGANIZATION2 so we could find them & just before we found them my friends in the @CAPS6 group came & had to wait @NUM1 minutes wich seemed long. So they didn’t get chance to get chaced by the guy with the chainsaw.	7	10	17
18880	7	Have you ever been patient or been told your patient? Patience has Patience is a @NUM1 year old girl who is always told how patient she @CAPS1 is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One day patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in juancey so her mom started to look it up on the internet. It take her mom two weeks to get every thing ready, she had the amusment park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they are going to stay at @TIME1. The whole time patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her an amusment park. When they got to the hotel Patience mom had to get the room key get to their room unpack and get dressed to go. The whole patience didn't say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time patience did not complain. They finally got their ticket and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a looong line for that to, Patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. Her mom said ''ok '' and they waited for an hour until they get to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had fun. That is patience story of being patient. I hope you liked it.	8	10	18
18885	7	A time when I was patient was  when my little sister was in the bath tub for four hours taking a bath. But I was waiting for her to be done.	5	4	9
18894	7	"It was a hot @DATE1 day in @CAPS1 my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. We went on all of the rides. Our last one was the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The line was short when we were walking there. Once we got there the line was all the way to the train. It was like waiting for a pig to fly. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My dad and mom stayed to save our spots. When we got back my parents were another back. ""@CAPS4 are we so far back?"" my brother said. My parent got out of line so they could get a drink. Ten families wanted got in line. We waited and waited until, something spontanious happend to us. The ten families were is the wrong line so we got to be in front (behind three other families). My family and I had so much fun it was worth waiting."	9	5	14
18895	7	Everyone has to have patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say “Patience is vertile.” @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”	6	7	13
18897	7	It was @DATE1 and @PERSON4 was in class messing around at his desk like usual. @PERSON4 isnt usually the patient kind of a person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and @PERSON4 had thought in his head that it was the one of the best answers. @PERSON4’s hand shot straight up in the air. One of the first hands raised. “@CAPS1! Lots of answers.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry said. @PERSON1 berry is kind of more of a round person, with some big glasses to see. But all of the students love her as an @CAPS2 teacher, “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 whats your answer?” @CAPS5 I was just scratching my head. Okay @CAPS6.” “@CAPS7 language?” @CAPS8 good answer though”. There were about @NUM2 more hands in the air. In @PERSON4’s head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. “@CAPS9 these last @NUM3 people and then we will go @CAPS5.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry exclaimed. @PERSON4 was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. “@CAPS10”. @PERSON3 said. “@CAPS11 a metaphor?” @CAPS10 answered. “@CAPS13 you’re right it was a metaphor.” “@CAPS14 darn it that was my answer!” @PERSON4 mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer @PERSON4 was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently.	10	12	22
18904	7	Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you “don’t have the time” to do something then you don’t have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldn’t be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldn’t be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.” @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now	8	6	14
18906	7	My neighbor was very patient when he killed that @NUM1 point buck for the first time! He was??? and proud that he caught this beautiful white tail deer!. He said he`d never been this proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered my neighbors’ face when he told me, I was so happy for him. If I had the money I would have got something for @NUM1-point buck. When I got to sec the head my jaw dropped it was the most beautiful deer I’ve ever seen.	9	6	15
18911	7	One time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play the game I had wait a while so went to my friends last of sitting and watching I am never patient when theres food involved I don’t like to wait for my food it sucks when I have to wait. I don’t know any other time I was patient I don’t like to be patient.	3	4	7
18926	7	Once upon a time there was a young girl named @CAPS1 she lived with her dad and mom in a small town of @PERSON2. It was mom in a small town of @PERSON2. It was almost her birth and she was so exited for this birthday because she was turning twelve. Twelve was here luckey number ever sience she was little. Her mom said they could go into town and go to chef @PERSON1 and eat out she agreed so that morning she woke up and dad made her some pancakes with fresh strawberrys on them she went out to go milk there cows for her parents. @CAPS1 hated milking there cows because they are very stuburn so she went out there and miked the cows in only @NUM1 minetts. @CAPS1 went back inside and put the milk on the table. @CAPS1 was starting to wonder if she was going  to get a birthday present, @CAPS1 decided it would be best if she was patient when her mom came home from work (she works at a dress making store) she said, “Are you ready to go eat,” @CAPS1 jumped “And yeld yes, yes. So they rode in to town and parked at the restaurant, they walked in and the lights are off her dad got the light switch and all of her cloose family and friends where there and they yelled “sprise” @CAPS1 was is such a shock she yelled “@CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, and on a table was twelve presents, and under the table was a dog. Her mom & dad got her a dog. She name the dog wonder because every time she saw him she began to wonder about her  wonderful life. And she learned that great thing come when you are patient.	8	10	18
18944	7	One time I was patient. I don’t want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun.	4	8	12
18971	7	Patience is??? our or waiting???Patience is dealing with teachers at school and trying to understand their point of view. Without patience you and your younger sitting or young??? teacher would  constantly be  fighting. That’s why patience is as important. Patience should be constantly exconsiled.

18977	7	On @DATE1 I was with my dad at @NUM1 am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tried & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many night I heard leaves cracking & I thought is it really true. On my first day I would shoot one I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quick & he ran away. On another day we came out I saw another dies but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & @CAPS1 I aimed & fired! Well that’s what I thought but no it was jamed and @CAPS1 I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walky-talky, & asked “what are you doing.” @CAPS1 I said “I see a doe,” @CAPS1 he said “then shoot it,” & it stood there @CAPS1 I shot again & then it ran away, “I missed” I said all that patience for nothing.	10	9	19
18982	7	It takes a lot of patients especially when you are travelling for @NUM1 hours strait. When I was @NUM2 we went to @LOCATION3 for a half a year. Me my mom and my dad left at @NUM3 am for the airport. We waited there for a long time. When we finally got on the plane we took the hour long flight to @LOCATION4. Ten a @NUM4 hour flight to los @LOCATION1. We waited in those airports for a long time. Then came the @NUM5 hour flights to @LOCATION2. That was the longest flight I’ve ever been on. The plane was a huge double deck @NUM6 jet. Then we took the @NUM7 hour flight to hawk bay. It was a really long trip. It took a ton of patients. Well we went there because my dad was making a golf coarse. That takes a lot of patients too but, its a lot more fun. That was the most patient I’ve ever had to be.	8	11	19
18988	7	"One time I should patient was when I friend same thy that I wanted for long time. As soon as I got here I charged towards the computer to see did was still available. ""@CAPS1."" I sad try am plently, it was still there. It had taken me sad a long time to sort up for it.

My heart hoped and beat faster @CAPS3 I ran inside and ward it up and there, it was my @CAPS4 new I pad buck I was so, so happy and all of ""my patience had payed off I had got it."	11	8	19
19004	7	The word patience means a lot of things. It can mean waiting and something and much more. It also talks a lot ??? It takes time and effort. I’@CAPS1 the type who complain a lot and I don’t have patience. Other people they don’t complain they an it. A lot of teenagers have no patience. As you get older you develop patience some adults don’t have patience it depends on if you work at it. It also depends on whether the person has gone through in life.	5	6	11
19006	7	Patientce I was patient when I did not want to go wisconsic. Iwas patient on my way there (driving). I was possent when I was fishing, not complaining now boring it is. I wasnt about sleep on @CAPS1 ground. The whole camping trip I was patient. Story begins. @STATE1, took @NUM1 hours. In the car had a t.v. I wolened that for while and then I looked outside and say a moose! I screamed, ''moose!!'' my rooms boyfriend, mike stoped and backed up and that was my first time saw a moose. Then when we got there we set up our tent and then went fishing. I was patient for the fishing to bite my wom. I was so patient I got @NUM2 fish that day. Then when we came back i had to sleep on the groind. There was bumps and rocks under me, but didn't complain because thak how comping is. The next day we were on our way back and I couldn't fina the t.v. and didn't have a drink. I had to go to the bathroom. A sign said, a @CAPS2 station on exit @NUM3''. I was patient went to the bathroom and to get a water.	8	9	17
19015	7	I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Some times we have  to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game  and movie releases. but I am  going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasent waiting for the plane to arive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didn’t like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just  to get our food. It was very crouded and it took all patience to not get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how i was feeling oxbout  my patients is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patients  and stay calm.	6	9	15
19052	7	Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just @CAPS1’t control yourself? You ask your parents, “when” and they say, “soon just have some patience!” well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “aww!” everyone screamed. “@CAPS1 I hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. “you are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient @CAPS1 pay off!	12	12	24
19078	7	When I went to get my new phone I had to be patient because my grandma likes to work with a spacific person. The man named @CAPS1 who my grandma and me were waiting for finally came to us so we went to the phase I wanted and he talking for long time, but my grandma said if I wasn’t patient I wouldn’t get my new phone that day. We make it up to the counter and he’s showing thing about the phone, I want to get out of there so I could look at it myself. Me and my grandma finally leave and I have my new phone with and I like it. Name one time you were patient and what you were patient for!	8	9	17
19092	7	My story of when I was patient was when me and my family were going to the monster jam. It was one of the most exciting things of my life. But the trip there was almost @NUM1! then it took half an hour to find a place to park. Then eleast @NUM2 minutes for my moms friends to show up. And finally an hour in line. Last but not leas @NUM3 minutes to find our seat! thank you for listening to  my report about patience and sitting through it!	7	8	15
19093	7	There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said “@CAPS1 not tonight,” because it was a school night. So I said “okay I know it’s a school night,” @CAPS2 at least I said it with maners and loyalty! and thats a time I when I was loyalty to someone and here is a time when I stuck up for someone, well my bestfriend was in a fight with this other girl and it was in person and I went right up to my @CAPS3 friends “enimey” and said why don’t you just go home and leave my friend alone and she backtalked me then finally we started ignoring her then she left, that’s a time when a stuck up for my bestfriend while she was in a fight.”	6	6	12
19094	7	When I had to go to the doctor. I had thought that I would be in front. It was over @NUM1 people there in line when we got there more people was still coming. I had to get my shots. So we had to wait patiently. But my mom could not wait because it was so many people there in front of use. So I fell asleep. She was still walking around. So wen I woke up five people had already gone by. She still could not be patient, still walking around making me nervous then another @NUM2 went by its going really really slow. Then she finally cooled down. She was so patient because they said they was going to put her out. I have never seen her so patient it was no believable.	9	8	17
19125	7	A time when I was patient is last year when my dad took me hunting. It all began when we woke up at @NUM1 in the morning got dressed and left to go get in are deer blind. As soon as we got there we heard a lot of gun shots. From shot guns, rifles and even black powder. We waited all day until it was dark again then we packed up and we left. Me and my dad didn’t see anything that whole day. That is a story about how I am patient.	8	9	17
19139	7	Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out. Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience.	5	6	11
19160	7	One time when I was patient was when I was in the end of the year in fourth grade and I’d just signed up for football. I had @DATE1 wait from @DATE1. When I got my football pads, I was so excited for football I put them on about four times before football started. @DATE1 passed by and it was @DATE2. In @DATE2 I show cows so that made @DATE2 zip by really fast. Finally it was @DATE1. I only had @DATE1 wait eleven days until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super fast and six p.m. came fast. Then it was time @DATE1 go. I liked football that year and I have did football ever since.It took patience @DATE1 wait for football. Two months @MONTH1 not seem long, but for a ten year old it is hard @DATE1 wait that long.	10	9	19
19175	7	When im patient is mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be patient to wait for deer. They don't always come sometimes it could just be a fawn. Other  times it can be does. put when you see a buck ???is everything you first have to wait for it to come in close enough for a shot. When it does you have to wait to bring up your gun. Then you have to wait for a shot. If you get it you be patient and wait for it to die. If you cdnt find it right away dont give up. That is when I was patient.	9	8	17
19183	7	I’m writing a story about patience. Patience in can say like I’m waiting for you to get done with whatever your doing. Something like the o, say @CAPS1 been waiting for the kids to be quite. And they can’t so even though she’s getting mad, she still being patient with us instead of saying get out my class giving us chance after chance. Because she want us to be good and stay in class.	6	6	12
19191	7	A time when I was patient was when went to the mall.”@CAPS1 @CAPS2” I said to whoever was behind me my mama and had come to the mall to get some @DATE1 clothes. That mall was crowded. Couldn’t nobody get in where I was getting so patient. The ever had was to understand and it was this white family walking by and they all bumped me. I was so patient waiting in one. I was just ready to left everybody when finally came our time. That was time when I was patient. I was so proud of myself I held at in. The @CAPS3.	8	6	14
19217	7	Last year, @DATE1 it was my birthday, so I told my @CAPS1 what I wanted for my @DATE3 and out of everything I said “@CAPS1 I want a @CAPS2” (@CAPS3 station @CAPS4). So the @DATE2 we go out at three in the morning to get my @ORGANIZATION1 and we were at best buy. So we walked up to the store and we opened the door and there had to be over @DATE4 people in the store. So we walk over to the game. I she and their was two text and their was five people in the section so we grabed one of the two. But when we got in line half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line. We got home at @TIME1. This story is not about what I wanted its about patience. So I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my @CAPS2, werever you go use patience you will get thought about and treated nicer than you expect.	8	8	16
19222	7	I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: @CAPS1. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he should’ve realized I wouldn’t just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, I’d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn’t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That’s how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @CAPS1, and him.	9	8	17
19229	7	It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME3. The sun was just coming up as I got into my box blind. It had snowed the @TIME1 but it was only @DATE1. Then again I was in the upper penisaala of @LOCATION1. I was hunting for a monster ten point with my brand new @NUM1 and @TIME2 gun could kill a dear @NUM2 yards. I have been sitting for an hour but it felt like a day. I’ve only seen a squarile and he was fun to watch in all but not the rush you get when you see a deer. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I was looking in the direction the sound was coming. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” gun up @TIME2 time my adrenilen hicking in. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I see move ment put my scope on it and I see it. It’s a it’s a grouse? I glowered the gun calmed down and watched it eat some corn. It was @NUM3. time for lunch and all I had was a turkey sandwhich, a apple, and a bottle of water. I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I  saw a brown figure move. I grabed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So picture @TIME2 a guy with all come on. An apple in his mouth, and look in a scope. As I looked  I realized it was him the big @NUM4. Massive horns, a big body and he was proble five maby six years old. I put my crosshairs just be hind the shoulder and I diehed the safety off. Slowly pulled the trigger. My mind a blur and “@CAPS4!” perfect shot. Later @TIME2 I found him and he was big @NUM5. I got him mounted and that’s were he is now.	12	11	23
19242	7	I remember one time I was impatient, it was when my called and said she was go send me @NUM1$. @CAPS1 I asked her when she was to send it and she said @DATE3. Today was @DATE4 so that mean I had to @NUM2 days. @CAPS1 the next day had cameup  and the ???  truck came by and I thought I had mony but it wasn’t @DATE3 yet, @CAPS1 I said, “@CAPS2.” @DATE1 came, I was still waiting so I tried going to the day can past by “ @CAPS3 it! So @CAPS1 it was @DATE2 they had my favorite game on sale “The bully” the case had a yellow sticker that @NUM3 and no tax at all,@CAPS1 I was mad and @CAPS4 went home. My dad woke me up and said “its @DATE3 “ I @CAPS1 I rose up ate breakfast @CAPS1 check the mail, @CAPS1 it bills, bills,bills and “ my money” my sent we an ???. At last I said I have money, so I bought some icecream @CAPS1 I bought my favorite game “bully”. “that’s the time when I was patient.	9	8	17
19250	7	One time I was patient was when I had to get some @CAPS1 done and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my @CAPS1. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited, I decided to watch an episode of spongebob while I waited. As the episode ended I went back to the computer. She still wasn’t done! So I made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate @NUM1... and so on I got to @NUM2 and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasn’t. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2 got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing. I got out. I went upstairs to change. I came downstairs and surprisingly my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my @CAPS1. This took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait so long.	11	12	23
19253	7	One time I had to use patience when we were driving to @CAPS1. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (@NUM1 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @NUM4 ocklock @CAPS2 time and,in @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am.  I was very tired of being patient, I’m not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!	8	8	16
19254	7	Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who “claims” to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isn’t up yet.	4	6	10
19255	7	When I was @NUM1 yrs old my mom started making my @DATE1 present. She was going to make a blanket. Sadly she didn’t find the blanket.I have to be patient. I had  and it wasn’t done, then ???. My @DATE1 was almost @NUM2 months ago ???. She ??? found a time to ??? that she ??? find ??? in @NUM3. I have been patient and every year on my @DATE1 and on @CAPS1 I ask if it is fiished but I’m not. I s ??? I can be patient for alittle while???	9	6	15
19256	7	One time when I was patient was when I was fishing. We where fishing on a cold night and no fish where bighting,. I was just @CAPS1 ther being patient caling sun flower  seeds. My dad was getting mad and I was still @CAPS1 listning  to the backeasard  celtcs  games.  We where only catching little fish that night nuthing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didn’t have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample.	8	8	16
19266	7	Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!	12	12	24
19276	7	So one day in fifth grade I was running around playing tag on the play ground when  “push”  I got push off the slide a bout a ???fell and back my arm so it went ??? or they in pain so ??? went to the doctor’s and waited for two hours and I just sat patient by not moving my arm at all watching other people walk in and out finily they called my name they told me my arm was broken out the could not put cast on there to we went to the other doctor across the rode waited @NUM1 minutes and got a blue cast about a month later I got it taken off went back to the x ray room but then said I have to cast it up again this time I got ??? and eventily to got it taken off and thats the time I was patient.	8	8	16
19285	7	One time I got in trouble for getting a @CAPS1 on my report card and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. So I went up stairs to read a book. A hour later I came down and asked. How long am I grounded? She said I don’t know how meny times do I have to ask you to tell. Sow I was buging her all day. She said I am running out of patients. I said can you just tell me she said okay. She pulled out a sheet of papper. I said what is that? She said I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times “yikes”! My said twelve days and that is final, I said okay. I think I lerend a lesson today? Don’t bug your mom all day and do better in school!	8	10	18
19286	7	One sunny beutful day I went out and was driving my glad around and all of a sudden my mom yelled at me and said she was going to go get my new good in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and she said I couldn’t go @CAPS5 I sat down waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting. Then I decided to play playstation @NUM1 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) @CAPS5 I was playing far two hours strait, and then I decided to go watch @CAPS6 assassain  (@CAPS7) . After that was com I went back to play in playstation @NUM1(p.s.@NUM1.), again. played it for another hour. Then all of a sudden I hear beep, beep, @CAPS5 I look out the window, and it was my .  @CAPS1 ma. Then we talked bout the new qlad and then I hear beep, beep and it was my . my .  new @CAPS8!. Then I ran out took it out and roud it for like @NUM3 hours strait. That is how I had patient for about @NUM4 to @NUM5 hours long. I was proud of myself after I was done riding my new @CAPS8.	9	8	17
19292	7	One sunny after noon I was so waited because. I was going to see my faveret band. When I’m in school! My mom picked me up from thired gread I was so excited it was time to go. My dad droped my broter of at my grandma’s house (he was only at doy so he could not go.) I was bounsing of my seut “mom are we there yet?” I ask “@CAPS1 we have two more hou’re to we are there, then a nother hour, so we are going to see the place here.”mom said  “@CAPS2, can I have my d.v.d please.” I side. So now it has been two hours I’v been in the car. Then we went every were my mom and dad wanted to go not were I wanted to. Then it was time to go see. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! When we aroved I was a little sleepy but that would not stop my. When they only plaed two song I want to sleep on the seet. I wated all day to see them and I went to see. That was a time I was patient to see my faveret band.	8	8	16
19298	7	Patience it take a lot to have patience. One time my sister was trying to hate me but I didn’t let her get to me @CAPS1 I have patience @CAPS2 I get made so I’m watching tv she standing the task @CAPS3 can you move off infront of the tv and she moved she sat by me and keep on touch me it didn’t bother me at all she asked me over and over “@CAPS4 I’m @CAPS5 you” I said ‘@CAPS6’ I going to antil I make made I said so you don’t bother me at get out my face @CAPS2 I really get mad so she tried her best by trying to ripup my home work so I said I don’t care she had a smart comment whatever and I keep watching tv so I was so patient with her she said im  go make mad so I ignored her she got mad and kept saying do you hear me I just walked outside and and said  to myself I cant go let her get to me @CAPS1 we mite end up fighting I went  back in the house and sat down and I told her you cant make me mad so you might won’t to stop so she said girl whatever and I was so ready to say something but I wasn’t go give her nothing to feed off.	6	7	13
19301	7	I remember when I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my step-grandmother for @CAPS1 and went fishing. I didn’t really went to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek we were going to fish in was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the ‘backyard’. I flung my fishing lips into the water and waited. After maybe @NUM1 minutes or nothing (except my sister who caught most things.) The finally started to unravel. Excited, I kept out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the real. Twisting and twisting the handle for what seemed like forever, I brought it up. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My step grandmother threw the fish back. After another @NUM1 minutes I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster then ?? I’d caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step grandmother. My patience lead up to me catching the biggest fis of the day and learning something new.	10	12	22
19302	7	Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So I’m happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.	7	4	11
19315	7	I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also about waiting for your ??? like when you are bored.	7	5	12
19321	7	The first time I learned patience was when I was I my mom said she would by me a play @NUM1 I wanted it so bad but in, had to wanit to get it so I did and I waited and waited and waited then if figured it’s a whole month that and nothing happend I just was so mad but I didn’t do anything so we went to wal mart and she bought me a play @NUM1. I was in happy. Later I asked for an xbox (stirl seven) my mom said wait I waited for @NUM3 months but still nothing. @NUM4 months nothing, @NUM5 months nothing, I was just so angry but a whole year passed I got @NUM6. I was awsome I got my own room and @CAPS1. I got an xbox @NUM7 to being older is awesome.	8	5	13
19323	7	I was patient when I was going to the docteis to get???  ??? I didn’t complan about it. I had to wait for @NUM1 hours. Then when I went in thay toke a couple of ways it toke about @NUM2 hour. Then thay take some tests then at the end I finally went home. That was the time I was patient.	6	7	13
19327	7	Patience, can you be patient? Some people are and some are and some  are not. Some time  I can not. Well hear is a story about patience. One time at school in the lunch line, it was long. It would bearl  move. I wanted lunch so bad I was not being patient. But for some resson my friend was being patient. I said to her why are you so patient? She said because everyone is going to be able to  get something to eat. I said yeah that is true. So I tryed to be patient and before I know it I was siting by my friends  talking and eating my food.	8	8	16
19331	7	A day of dreadful patience “can we leave now @CAPS1. I’m so bored I complained.” I waited for an answer but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in @LOCATION1 waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. Impatient guys. “That’s it I’m gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and don’t touch anything.” @CAPS1 said. So I sat here cold bored and hangry waiting for what seemed like hours. Finaly my @CAPS1 got back and told me it might be another @NUM1. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while. After we got some food we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A fork lift driver not somehow managed to get his fork lift stuck in the trailer. That’s when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out and then all heard was holler’s and screams. FINALY! After my @CAPS1 yelled a bit we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that some thing I definitely don’t have is patience.	8	12	20
19339	7	It’s about three @CAPS1 clock the clock tells me, but I can’t go to sleep because my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I are going fishing. So  it’s eight @CAPS1’clock now my @CAPS2 was suppose to be here at seven, but my grandma kept say he’ll be here, so I believe her but I was a little worried.Now it’s ten @CAPS1’clock in by know. I’m just furious I am about to cry, but my grandma said he’ll be here, in I said, “@CAPS4 he won’t in went in my room then I realize he well be here he will be here.Then I heard the door open I ran in it was him I ran in said you finnaly came in we ate then I look outside in seen the boat. That’s a time I should patience.	8	7	15
19345	7	I’m going to write about when I was patience. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone she said if I be patience I will be able to get a phone so I was patience. Time flew bye and family she sad yes see when I was patience to get a cell phone I got one. Have you ever been patience with your family? Tell me did it work out of did it go bad with your family if you are it probably will work for you.  And that is what happens when you are patience.	8	8	16
19346	7	“@CAPS1 !Did it came yet!?” I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop.She was I n standing from the mail box, holding a thick wad of envelopes .One of these, I hoped was the letter. “@CAPS2 yet honey ,” she said “but there’s plenty of bills to go around.”  I wanted  to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what @CAPS3 said ,”  just wait long  enough and you’ll get what you want”  I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesn’t sound that important but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get @NUM1 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire @DATE1 for results .Pretty good system ,huh? No ! Pretty soon, other things distracted me swim meets, tennis, book, and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. @CAPS3 was right I guess. One @DATE2 @TIME1, on the @DATE1, I was on the porch reading. Out of the coner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced classes: @CAPS4 studies @CAPS5 @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off!	8	12	20
19353	7	Everyday at school I have to be patience to get my food like pizza,saled,sand with milk what is bad all the time but i check my milk. I had to be patientce to get my gun to.	4	4	8
19363	7	A time I was patient was when I got my shots. It was just me and my dad. I had to get my shots because I was sick. It was still cold outside because it was in @DATE1. We went to the @ORGANIZATION1 for children. In the beginning, I was at home getting ready to go. I put on an orange turtle neck sweater and jeans with sneakers. I didn’t want to go because it was after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information then we sat. In the middle, we start to watch television. I was really bored because it was nothing on but informercials. They had us waiting fo over an hour. I start to get hungry and very upset.  They finally called our name. In the end it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a juice. Then she told me I was getting @NUM2 shots. I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots. The information I got was just as painful as getting my shots. They had us wait for a very long time. I was sad to have to wait but happy it was over.	8	12	20
19369	7	Once I went to @CAPS1 world and we were waiting for about @NUM1 hours to get on this stupid rude. I was they because I had my @ORGANIZATION1 so I played that but on to an hour I got bored. I picked on my sisters and it was on watching them get mad. Then I got bored with that so I just sat down on the road.	8	7	15
19377	7	One @DATE1 day, my uncle took me to @CAPS1 point to go on a roller @CAPS2, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The line was so long, we waited at least @NUM1 hours. Time went by slowly and we finally got on. After, we went to the @CAPS5 thrill @CAPS6, which took about an hour and a half.	7	7	14
19384	7	Being patient is hard to be. First of all its like your waiting in a??? a and line that could take forever. Being patient at this line could take long time but it could go by fast if you had something to do. You could bring a book to read and read at the way up to one from the line or be patient and???.	5	5	10
19400	7	Without patience a person can be very easily broken. Without patience a person can be easily trigger to as something horrible like myself I have patience but a certain time I sometimes don’t have patience. Without patience the whole world be out of control so that who most plans of business try to hate there???as first as possible. So that what all this was patience.	3	5	8
19411	7	On time I was payshent when my brother was ridining by quick I had to wait and wait for my brother to be done but he said I cant ride in but I told him that I was so I wait and wait but had been riding it for hours finally he had ran it out of gear and said now you can ride it. Now and I replied  my cool,	6	7	13
19416	7	When I was at universal studios and I was waiting in the long lines to get on the rides I was patient. It did take a while but I never got mad or impatient. My dad and I was in a line for this dragon rollercoaster we were so close to being next then it started raining and lightning. A lot of people left so we ended up being in the front of the line. We waited for another hour or two but it never stoped. We forgot about my mom and brothers so we left. I was patient the whole time. We went and got in line for one of the new rides they just got and since it new the line was long. We waited for quit a while. We eventually got on the ride and we realized the wait was worth it so we went again.	8	8	16
19427	7	RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here!  It took lots of my patience  to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our  three day stay at  @ORGANIZATION1.  I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased  @CAPS4 I didn’t care.  I finally snapped to it and kept my cool.  In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of @ORGANIZATION1 & friend  in my group named @PERSON1  told me some ideas, @CAPS4 I wanted to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they weren’t bad. I thought about ??? of the ??? and used it in my pamting. ??? now we’re at the nearly @NUM1 feet high ??? ladder  I  already took my ??? going up and zipping down the awesome get scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient @CAPS4 man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, @CAPS4 I said to myself “be patient.” @CAPS4 this on kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he  just sat right on one of the big planks of word. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most.	10	12	22
19429	7	One time when I was patient was a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 adventured! We  were by the water park most of the @CAPS3 and, it was fun. I seem more of my time in @CAPS5 have pool and on the @CAPS6 @CAPS7- my favoritende.We were getting soon tired of  the water park and decided @CAPS17 go  the rides! We were trying decide weather or not we wanted go on??? ??? Or the “@CAPS8! & @CAPS9: - I decided @CAPS5 go on??? and when we got there @CAPS5 ??? was like an hour long.

19442	7	"In my thirteen years of expirience I have road many roller coasters, and when there is a rollercoaster these is normally a two hour wait. In the @DATE1 @NUM1 I took my best friend @PERSON1 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2,"" and we had just gotten in line for a ride called ""The @CAPS3."" When we got to the entrance @CAPS4 said a forty-five minute wait so we got in line and the ride broke down for over three hours. Finally the ride was up and running but @CAPS4 took another half hour for testing and when that ended @CAPS4 was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so @CAPS4 didn't realy affect us. We finaly road that ride and was totaly worth @CAPS4. Most of the lines later that day were small but thats still one hour. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down."	8	8	16
19448	7	I remember when me, my brother, my dad and my mom were at ceder point. I wanted to go on so many rides but they all had big lines. So we waited for the rapter that took one hour just to get on the ride but when we got on it felt like it was even longer then the wait in line it felt like @NUM1 hours because of how ??? it was. We walked and saw the ??? force it had a ??? ??? on it so we waited in line was much longer than the rapter it was like 3-@NUM1 hours. But when we got to the hop of the stairs we were up it was so much fun because we waited so long and my brother stopped complen because he was so ??? in me. the ride was fun but when we were done we had to leave ??? was like mom. We only wait on the rides but it was fun and ??? That was a time when I was patient.	8	7	15
19454	7	My own way about patient is that when somebody is doing something. You have to wait until they done. An if you rush them they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is a very important thing. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you not being rude.	6	4	10
19467	7	I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things .If you be patient things will actually come faster than you think for example if you want something and you have to wait in line instead of running off and finding  something else at and wait it will always help. Be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even. If your waiting for a same at stem to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble. Be patient what even  your  doing  even if your waiting for a turn just wait it is not a big deal stop rushing things, just be very patient.	5	6	11
19468	7	“@CAPS1 on @CAPS2, where are you ,” @PERSON1 said in a frustrated undertone. @CAPS2 was suppose to @CAPS1 over to his house .@PERSON1 had just gotten a new trampoline and they were planning on oon bouncing all day after school .@PERSON1 was starting to get worried but he waited .Finally his mom came and told him that @CAPS2 wasn’t coming. Thats when the phone rang .@PERSON1 answered it and heard @CAPS2 on the end. “ @CAPS5, @PERSON1,” @CAPS2 croaked. He didn’t sound well. “@CAPS2,” @PERSON1 shouted into the phone, “@CAPS2 , @CAPS2 where are you.”  “I’m at my house, get over here. @PERSON1’s mom pulled up at @CAPS2’s house and let him out. @PERSON1 didn’t care about manners at this point,so he opened the door and marched to @CAPS2’s room. @CAPS2 was laying in bed looking up the cicling with his face looking very swollen. He turned to look at @PERSON1, held his gaze, then looked back at ceiling. @CAPS2 wasn’t at school that day either. He went skiing up at his family cottage. I wasn’t patient when I was in the air. I got crushed and none of it would have happened if I had waited.”	9	12	21
19478	7	“@CAPS1!”I yaled as the ball came over the net right to me. ” That was @CAPS1!”@CAPS2 said.  “@CAPS3 I was already there.”I responded.  “@CAPS4. @CAPS3 it’s @CAPS1.” @CAPS13 argued.  “@CAPS5 I said @CAPS1, you??? Moved and let me get it then wimp @CAPS6 me. And watch the ball drop. I exclaimed. “@CAPS7 I guess.”@CAPS2 apologized. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. “@CAPS9 is @CAPS10 @CAPS11!” the A team coach demanded. “@CAPS12 partner up in groups of three!”@CAPS13 said??? Mu two best friends som and @PERSON1 were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good. “You want to be partners with me and make? “@CAPS14 asked. “@CAPS15, “I responded. When it was our turn on the @CAPS11 we were going against @CAPS16, @PERSON1 who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, @PERSON1 and @CAPS16 all cheered. “@CAPS18! Very nice job ladies!”??? One of the coaches. It was the end of the second @DATE1 tryouts. There was only one more @DATE1 left. It was hard for me @CAPS3 I managed to keep together and patient. On the @DATE1 of tryouts we got to know our teams. We all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time. Me, @CAPS16, and @PERSON1 plus some other good girls made the A-team! So that’s a time where I had to be really patient and stay together, @CAPS3 I still came through and succeeded.	12	12	24

19481	7	AHH! Oh hi my name is @CAPS1 I’m going to tell you how I waited @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS2 to do something sweet. Ok I heard about this awesome but scary place called the @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Me and a few friends of mine @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 plan to @CAPS7 there in @DATE2. So far me and them have been just doing the ordinary. @CAPS5 up, @CAPS5 in the shower, @CAPS5 dressed, @CAPS7 to school. Today @DATE1, @CAPS8 are going to my parents’ house and @CAPS7 online to see when it opens .@CAPS8 found out in two days the new location will open up. It is near the parlor and down the road of @ORGANIZATION1. So @CAPS8 cheak it out and its nearby so @CAPS8 are so read to be screaming like a baby when it gets its bottle tooken away. Today is the day @CAPS8 are on the road but what @CAPS8 did realize was how many people would be there. When @CAPS8 got there it had at least @NUM3 people waiting! @CAPS8 sat in line and about every @NUM4 minutes the line decreased by @NUM5 people. Then finally about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 of waiting @CAPS8 were in the to @NUM7. It was just own luck too, @NUM1 people were not patient enough to wait but @CAPS8 were respectful. Then @PERSON2 had to @CAPS7 use the rest room so @CAPS8, walk across the  street so he could @CAPS7 then when @CAPS8 came back @CAPS8 ended up in the top @NUM9!@CAPS8 waited another @NUM10 then @CAPS8 were in! By the time @CAPS8 were done @PERSON2 was crying (he is @NUM11!) @PERSON1 wet his pants ( he is @NUM12!) and @NUM13 and I didn’t do anything ,@CAPS8 had one heck of a night but it never would have happened if @CAPS8 were not so patient.	12	12	24
19494	7	Hi, I’m @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I have green eyes, blonde hair, I have a good personality. Okay, so am going to tell you about a time when I was focused. Okay so it was @NUM1 last year yar @DATE1 I think. My mom and I were left for a doctor’s appointment. So we left around @NUM2 after school started. So when we got there I was just waiting for like @NUM3 hours bored out of my mind. I didn’t know what to do so I saw the fish @CAPS3 I was watching them for about @NUM4, doing nothing then finally the women of the counter desk said , “@PERSON1 then I knew it was our turn. So we went in the room I layed on the bed. I went to sleep on accident, but while I was sleeping they gave me a painful shot it hurt so bad. Then I woke up and that was the time “when I was paitient.”	7	7	14
19497	7	I was patient when my mom when to the doctors and she was having a baby and I had to wait in the waiting room for @NUM1 hour for ???.	5	4	9
19506	7	Sometimes on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, I have to control myself so I don’t just go off on someone or totally say something mean to them! Like @DATE1 actually we are going camping up in @LOCATION2. We always go for about a one to two hour hike. And when  we do we go to lake @LOCATION1 but just before that to get there we take an “adventure hike,” so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods and over or even through the river. But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates the by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! (@CAPS3 sometimes I get annoyed at myself!) @CAPS4 on the way back its more fun after we go swimming in the @CAPS5 cold water! (@CAPS3 my dad says it clears my head! But it really doesn’t!) And by the time we get back, we are ready to have dinner, but dinner isn’t ready yet. @CAPS4 I get to be in a bad mood… again! And have to wait some more!	12	8	20
19507	7	Two years ago, my two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didn’t sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2. She would sleep during the day and wakeup at night they eventually taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience but she was finally adopted.	9	8	17
19516	7	@CAPS2 father has recently lost his job. It has been hard. It has exactly @NUM1 since @CAPS2 father has had job. @CAPS2 father has been constantly applying for jobs. But he didn't give up. He kept on trying and trying. Fortunately @CAPS2 father has a job interview in san @CAPS1 in a couple of weeks he is going. Hopefully he will get the job.  Thankfully @CAPS2 father has been very patient. Even though he is being rejected constantly, he still trys very hard to get a job. @CAPS2 father is @CAPS2 I role model because of his amazing level of patientence. Thank god, I have someone to care for me who his as patient as @CAPS2 father. Without the patience of @CAPS2 father @CAPS2 family could live. Well job or no job I will always love @CAPS2 father. This would be true because of @CAPS2 fathers great level of patience. For that main reason that is why @CAPS2 dad will always be @CAPS2 heroe and number one beloved role model	12	12	24
19517	7	"Patience is a very diffult thing @CAPS1 some people. One time I was at a huge party. But none of my friends or cousins were there. I was board the whole time. I asked my mom if we can go home she said ""no"". Then I sat down I waited and waited @CAPS1 a really long time. Then finally we went home. The next day my mom sent me over to my cousins house @CAPS1 a sleep over. This was because I was being patient at the party. I learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing. You recieve good when you be patient."	6	8	14
19533	7	A time when I was patient I was patient on @CAPS1. I got to open are presents at nine thirtey in the morroning I had to wait and wait. So for two hours I wacth telavison. I though @CAPS2 would be hard @CAPS4 I made @CAPS2 through. That @CAPS1 I thougt was the funnest @CAPS4 I lied I think this year will be. That day I made breaskfest in bed. I actually had a lot of fun. I got my mom a couple things of purfoom. @CAPS4 of course she doesn’t use them I do I got her some candles we got my dad a bright orange sweat shirt. We also got him some @PERSON1.	6	8	14
19547	7	"A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office I had to get six teeth pulled. When we where waiting I keep asking my mom ""when are we going when are we going."" When the said ""@CAPS1"" i waked into the room. I asked if i was going to hurt and they said you won't fell a thing."" The doctor put a tube on my mouth and said close your eyes and breath. with out even knowing I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours and when I wanted to get out of the chair they said ""no, no, no"" so I sat and sat until @NUM1 minutes later they let me out I was all loope and had to be put in a wheel chair. When I got to the front desk they let me take two toys and my mom gave me wresteler. When we where about to leave my mom talk to the doctor and they took for  ever. When we got in the car my mom took the wheel chair back and we where off. during the ride my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day cause of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror but I did and it was grass. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks d so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat I was happy. I am still patient cause the doctor said that grawn up teeth would come in a few months but it has been two years and nothing so I am disappointed, but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get bcacies which is gonna hurt really bad."	8	10	18
19548	7	On a fine @DATE1 day I was heading toward the @CAPS1 office. I wasn't pleased. I didn't want the son to get there. But it did. When we got inside, my mom went to the checkin lane I just sat down. When my mom got done she sat right next to me and we waited. And we waited and waited. We waited for about @NUM1 minutes until the @CAPS1 came and called us in. Right when we get into his office a nurse came in and checked my temperature, heat beat, ex. When she was done and left we waited and waited. We sat there for @NUM2 minutes before the @CAPS1 came in. when he was done we checked out and left and @CAPS2 don't have to go there again.	9	9	18
19559	7	A patent person in my life is my mom. Aicason my mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events. Soccer practice friends home and other places if I need to go there. Also she spends money on our soccer, our hobbies and other things we need or sometimes want. She is never certain and is always kind when were sad or anry and takes lot of time to do stuff for us. Also whenever were havinn trouble in school she helps us study, an example of most of these events would be that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year and thats not including additional things like gear, uniforms and team stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour even has to driving me and my brother places like cross country, soccer and basketball she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I needed help with a test she stayed with me for corily @NUM1 hours. Also whenever I do bad in school she just encourages me to do better but still is a little discouraged because she wants me to do good. She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals in conclusion my mom is one of the most patient people I know.	9	7	16
20716	8	 A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON2 who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure. I started &lt;@CAPS5 knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS1 sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom&gt;. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS5 @CAPS5&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.             FIN	18	16	34
20718	8	" Some people like making people laugh, I love it. I will do most anything to get a good laugh. I will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of ""special"" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still at the tender age of five I loved making people laugh, and being special I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. For example one time I hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures and I wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how ""special"" I was (I got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street I fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm ""special"", and that I'm a complete spaz I can get on with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. Surprisingly I have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgies). That day is what this whole story is about, it's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm ""special"", and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when I would get into the story and lose my guard I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. The story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. The story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a ""special"" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  To this day I still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course I can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, I'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember, being ""special"" could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh."	15	20	40
20734	8	"    ""Laughter is the best medicine."" The phrase almost everyone has heard before. But it'@CAPS20 true! I've had days when all I could think about was how @CAPS23 life sucked, or at least seemed to. The days when you feel like everything is going wrong, and nothing could make it worse... And that'@CAPS20 when one of @CAPS14 best friends will make me laugh. I'll laugh so hard I'm on the verge of @CAPS19 @CAPS14 pants and @CAPS14 eyes water. I'll laugh so hard no sound comes out, @CAPS14 sides cramp and I fall on the floor. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think that even if I was in a coma, they'd say something so funny that I'd sit straight up in the hospital bed and @CAPS21 laugh the huge belly laugh that sometimes escapes me.    There was this particular time when @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others. We staggered to @CAPS1'@CAPS20 house flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know how it is when you and your best friends @CAPS9 @CAPS21 @CAPS13 so tickled by each other? Those times when you glance at your friend and @CAPS21 as you've begun to calm down, you see her pinched expression from trying not to laugh, and you lose it all over again. If you've ever had the pleasure of experiencing these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how hard we were laughing.    Anyway, we stumbled into her house, trying to get serious, since we did have to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were starving after all that laughing, so @CAPS1 told @ORGANIZATION1 and me that we could get some cereal. @CAPS21 regular milk and cereal, right? There'@CAPS20 nothing @CAPS22 special about @CAPS4'n @CAPS5 (besides that it'@CAPS20 freaking delicious). But on that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I'd ever tasted, and I @CAPS6, @CAPS6, @CAPS6, milk, so that had to mean something. ""@CAPS7 this milk is so good! @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8!"" @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. ""@CAPS9 you kidding me with this? What kind of milk do you buy?!"" I blurted out. For some reason that milk was really extraordinary, and it was seriously blowing @CAPS14 mind. ""@CAPS10, I don'@CAPS17 know. Two percent?""@CAPS1 looked at us incredulously, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. Her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter. Now whenever one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it @CAPS21 happened.    @TIME1, it happened. @CAPS1 peed her pants, and not @CAPS21 a little. It wasn'@CAPS17 @CAPS21 the idle threat rushed out, the ""@CAPS12'mgoingtopee!"" squeal. @CAPS13 no. She actually peed herself, and I still @CAPS16'@CAPS17 even remember what I said to make her laugh that hard. All I know is suddenly (scaring me half way to death), she yelled out, ""@CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8 I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS18 @CAPS19! THERE'@CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24!!"" I whipped around and saw @CAPS1, red-faced and open-mouthed, supporting herself against the counter. She looked like the freaking @CAPS26 @CAPS27 of @LOCATION1 all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tight, crinkling at the corners, a few stray tears escaping as she tried to hold in shrieks of (apparently) crippling laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I was totally straight out laughing at her; pointing and laughing @CAPS14 shoulder-shake laugh, and it only made her laugh harder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-type run down the hall to the bathroom, where @DATE1 was. @CAPS1, in her wet jeans and with a red, tear streaked face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly bewildered and amused with what @CAPS21 happened. So naturally, @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at the sight of her, in her comically delirious state. Who wouldn'@CAPS17 have?   The fact that we @CAPS16 always laugh at each other and ourselves is why I love @CAPS14 friends . It'@CAPS20 great when you have people that you @CAPS16 laugh about everything and nothing with. @CAPS1 is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and @ORGANIZATION1'@CAPS20 pretty clever when it comes to thinking of them. Personally, I love laughing, especially with (and mostly at) @CAPS14 best friends.    "	23	20	43
20755	8	" ""Laughter is the key to the soul."" @CAPS1 you are having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, laughing can always make it better. I was sitting in @CAPS2 class one day, and was bored out of my mind. Then, a shy, quiet kid, all of a sudden started laughing! @CAPS3 couldn't stop! It was like @CAPS3 was on ""laughing gas."" @CAPS3 laughed so hard @CAPS3 couldn't breathe. Now this made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laugh. Soon enough the entire class was laughing! So even though some of the people in @CAPS2 class might have been bored, or had a bad day, the laughter was spread throughout the room, making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire, and it makes everyone happier. And when you are happier, you are healthier. So with that, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter in it, in order to work. When you ask someone what they like about there boyfriend or girlfriend, if it is a @CAPS2 relationship, they will almost always say, ""@CAPS3/she makes me laugh."" @CAPS5 when you don't have laughter in a relationship, you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh the more you can live a better life and enjoy life more. Have you laughed today?"	15	15	30
20770	8	 Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things @MONTH1 not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You @MONTH1 think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people @MONTH1 find very simple things considerably amusing, but others @MONTH1 be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us. And regardless of the way you @MONTH1 interpret laughter's abstract form, you've got to admit: it's kind of funny.	21	18	39
20787	8	 I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that alot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in it's own way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.                         So @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3.	20	20	40
20808	8	 Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughing is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my realationship with my sister @LOCATION1, we laugh all day, everyday. And I think thats why we have most fun together. I laugh most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with @PERSON2 and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. I'm just a laughing person. Everybody knows that. I think when I laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. I have this one friend namd @PERSON3, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time me and @PERSON2 were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. Then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. See, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. Who cares. Be you. I love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. In movies and tv shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  One time me and my sister @PERSON2 stole a truck, well.. We asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. It was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. So, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. It's funny to just sit there and reminise. I could tell you a thousand stories. Heres one. One time, me and @PERSON2 were living with our good friend @PERSON1, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! I'll never forget that time. And even when I'm writing this I still laugh about these stories. One time me and my sister @PERSON2 were skating downtown, and I was trying to do this one trick, I think it was a tre' flip? Anyways, I tryed to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory that I have, I laugh when remebered. One time me and @PERSON2 were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. That was really funny. In the video I'm mostly just laughing. 	15	16	31
20814	8	" Laughter is a mystery. Happens @CAPS2 ever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extream, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.  Around two months ago, in the cold @DATE1. It was my @NUM1 birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. @CAPS2 everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me whats going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddie @PERSON3 and my boyfriend @PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a @NUM1 pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""@CAPS1 up the cars, and let's go!"" @CAPS2 we approached the @ORGANIZATION1, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister in law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extream and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in peoples hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold,wet and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worse. Even now the shoes i was wearing are stained. @CAPS2 we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling outta my hair and clothing, the sauce steaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @MONTH1 think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS3 dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON3 threw nacho cheese at @LOCATION1, she threw chips at @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON3 tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs fer and in all the girls hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and @CAPS4 tree. So @PERSON3 finally said""@CAPS5 more nachos!""  @CAPS6 on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on @PERSON1 face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at @LOCATION2, she tossed it at @CAPS3 then @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON3 then @PERSON2. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @NUM3 live on @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't to pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ill see you @CAPS6, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and say nothing but huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken t.v. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH1 not see it right away. Though you will @CAPS2 you started laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on there faces. It @MONTH1 also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after them crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call @LOCATION3."	17	15	32
20849	8	" In a relationship you should be able to trust in each other, confide in each other, talk with each other, cry with each other and most importantly laugh with each other. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can definitely agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend, and boyfriend, @PERSON2. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days he can find a smile and a little giggle. I constantly thank @CAPS1 for putting him in my life.  The first thing that I really noticed about @PERSON2 when I started to get to know him better, is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he is making totally weird faces at me or tickling me until I can barely breath, he always knows how to get me laughing. When I am balling my eyes out to him, even then he can get me to giggle. Just @TIME1 I had had a terrible day at school and within a few minutes of me crying to him, he had cheered me up and got me to laugh. In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a face and start laughing, there's something about those blue eyes and that dorky smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning. When we play @CAPS2, or he plays and I fail at attempting to play, we always laugh at how bad I am at it, or when I finally do get an awesome kill. ""That just works out, don't it!"" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny but we have fun competing at who can say it the most in one day. The rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets ""the point"" (as if we actually keep score) but that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use. When ever there is a camera around @PERSON2 likes to make funny faces, which will always get me laughing. Then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too, they do say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at your self. One time, @PERSON2 his little sisters, @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 and I were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short I kneed myself in the forehead, @PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force, and he just got silent until I started cracking up. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were goofing around on the hard wood floor at his house and I pushed him to the ground, his whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red, but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off.  Even when things get rough our you disagree on something it is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other. Just because @PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree about a lot of things most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger. At times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one, we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject. Both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh.  Obviously I have reason too agree with the statement ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" because I have that connection in the best way possible. I am so thankful to have @PERSON2 in my life, his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between ""@CAPS3"" over a text message, cracking up at weird things we do or just watching a movie, we are always laughing at each other or with each other. As we both would put it ""were freaking soul mates!"""	21	23	44
20865	8	 It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy.	20	18	38
20870	8	" Laughter is important, we all know that. It makes life easier, happier and even helps you live longer. It's also very important to relationships. When talking about preference in significant others it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, this is why. this story is , however, not about dating. It is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next.  I had known @PERSON1 for a while for a few months at this point, I had met him on the bus. He was pale, skinny, loud, and he always had something funny and offensive to say. He was a shut in. Before I met @PERSON1 I could dish it out but I couldn't take it. I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to befriending him, we were fighting about something so insignificant that I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Although I do remember what he said. He said that I was a ""hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun jokes at other peoples expense but would get up in someones face if they tried one at me."" this made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right but because it made me realise that @PERSON1 was actually a pretty good guy whose only real problem was that he didn't know when to shut up. Throughout the whole time I have known @PERSON1 he has never stopped smiling. He laughs off everything from stepping in dog crap to his fathers drug addiction he can dull the pain of any blow with laughter. @PERSON1 is my constant reminder to never stof laughing."	16	15	31
20876	8	 Laughter is the cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebodies pain. Laughter can mend a friendship to make two strangers become the best of friends. A person can ask anybody on the street of how much laughter is important in life and they would say that laughter is very important. It's like love, everyone needs a little of it in their life and like laughter, it helps a person grow and become an adult. A person can use laughter to help them with anything like getting a job, or trying to get the girl, or just having a good time and making new friends. It's one of the main elements of life that make a person how they are and what they do. In the @DATE1 I was introduced to a girl named @DATE3, by my cousin @PERSON1. She started talking to me and I was shy because she was a girl and I wasn't used to talking to girls. I cracked a joke and that made her and I laugh together and that was the first icebreaker to making a new friend. The days went by and we were text messaging each other each day over the phone, making jokes about how our day was and making jokes about each other. Eventually we started talking to each other over the phone. Teens these days usually don't use the phone to call people and that makes emotions hard to understand because talking over text hides emotions from one another. @DATE3 called me and we would talk to each other until late in the @TIME1, to where we would both fall asleep and leave the phone on, and again we would always be making jokes about everything. Making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school. Making her happy was what I needed to do, and one of the ways to make her happy was to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentlemen because I was raised that way.  @DATE2 formal was coming near and I was in need of a date. @DATE3 was my best option for a date since I was getting close to her and I was starting to get attached to her. When I had the chance I asked her to be my date for the @DATE2 formal which would be one of the most special nights of my freshmen year. The day of the formal came and we danced the @TIME1 away and of course I had to make a few jokes about other things which made everyone laugh and have a good time. Near the end of the dance I asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. She said I was funny, and nice, and cute which was good. We had a fun time because good humor and fun kept the @TIME1 alive. The next @DATE2 formal, the same thing happened with a different girl except that laughter was an important key and that made the @TIME1 so much fun. That @TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life that I had ever had, because we were laughing and having the best @TIME1 ever. Laughter is an important key in my life. I would have never gotten the girl or have had the best @TIME1 of my life if laughter was never involved. Laughter makes everything better and I use it in my everyday life because everybody needs to have a good laugh if they are in a bad mood. Without laughter my life would be dull and have no color that would make me who I am today. It's one of the many keys of life that everyone needs to be happy, and without it you would be less happy then you are right now. A small child could live his whole childhood without laughter or any other important element in his life and he could end up being a mean and cruel person who does not understand good values and humor. Everybody needs personality and color in their life and with out it everything id grey. Life is like a coloring book and without someone or something to color them in with, it's just useless.	17	20	37
20883	8	"Being able to laugh, is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share it with is priceless. Family moments like that, are times no one can take away. They will be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and a very depressing place. Laughter is the main connection between family and friends.  My family and I decided that for our @DATE1 break we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION1. Not one of us @CAPS1 how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went.After two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to get across was huge. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up stairs to see where we were at. There it was @LOCATION2.  Once we got off the boat and through the crowed highways of @LOCATION2, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border. I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she @CAPS1 what she was doing, she replied ""kinda"". After hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were suppose to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS1 what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip we drove around laughing and telling my mom, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment.   Being able to laugh, is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull. Being with family and taking a negative situation, and turning it into the best vacation ever with laughter is truly priceless.Everybody needs to laugh in their life,because you only live once so make it worth while."	20	16	36
20894	8	" As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile."	18	18	36
20896	8	" ""Many other people believe that laughter is an important of any relationship."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with those thoughts.  I came to @LOCATION1 about @DATE1, I did not speak @CAPS1 at all that time. I started going school. I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I go to school. Next day I walked in to school and I could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me.  ""@CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1,"" the girl said. ""@CAPS2, my name is @CAPS4. I'm from @LOCATION2. I don't really speak @CAPS1,"" I said to @PERSON1, then @PERSON1 started laughing so hard. ""@CAPS6-@CAPS6 you have accent,"" @PERSON1 said, ""it's really cute."" I laughed back. @PERSON1 looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first @CAPS7 friend ever.  I always thought that making new friends are hard, but the laughter made it much easier than it used to be."	15	15	30
20915	8	" @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever."	18	20	40
20917	8	"  The comfort of a laugh. Many different kinds of comfort can come from a laugh. My story is the comfort of love. @CAPS6 i was a young and foolish teen. (@CAPS1 wait that's what i would still be today.) A few days ago my friend @CAPS2 had me laughing so hard, and all because @CAPS5 slipped up while meeting my mother. (@CAPS2 was nerves to meet my mother.) For some reason @CAPS6 i started to laugh @CAPS5 suddenly began to act as if every thing was fine, and that there was nothing to be nerves about.  @CAPS7 latter @CAPS6 we went for our walk i asked him about it. I simply said ""@CAPS4 did your mood change @CAPS6 i began to laugh?"" @CAPS5 smiled and replied ""@CAPS6 you laugh i feel calm and know that i am going to be alright."" @CAPS7 myself being a typical teen girl i blushed, @CAPS7 quickly changed topics, while trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly i could not help my self. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek was over powering my will to not look. Turning my head slowly, sure enough there @CAPS5 was starring straight back in to my eyes, his eyes were wonderful they reminded me of sunflowers with a blue sky behind them. As @CAPS5 stared back i got a feeling as if @CAPS5 were trying to unlock all that i am, and all that i know with his eyes. As if @CAPS5 could see straight to my soul. Quickly I turned away. With a soft and almost beautiful voice @CAPS5 let a little laugh out. This laugh was as sweet to my ears, as nectar is to a hummingbird.  The next few days where hard. All i could think about was that walk. People must have thought i was crazy, every time i would remember the walk, each time i would remember his laugh. @CAPS7 let a laugh of my own out. @CAPS7 i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life. For me i laugh @CAPS6 I'm with the people i love. For some its watching t.v. that they find amusing, or maybe there kids did some thing rather silly. So silly you had to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is every where.  Laughter is never a bad thing in fact it has been proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits. Some people don't get it. Laughter is not some thing to be ashamed of ether, if some one laughs at you just laugh with them. Its not laughter that starts wars. its not laughter that kills people. its people who chose not to fill there lives with the joy of laughter.  So here is the goal. laughter can also be very contagious. So try and @CAPS8 a laugh on. Do some thing that @CAPS6 people remember it they will start there own laughs. Laughter-@CAPS8 it on!"	18	20	38
20940	8	 A few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat and it jumped about two feet into the air, Once again we started laughing really hard but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1 my dad my bother and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did. He flipped the switch and next thing i know i was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4-able to free himself from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues, i tried it first and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result to all these great funny times we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away , and @PERSON1 moved. In better words funny times @MONTH1 be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces.. 	20	14	40
20948	8	" During the @CAPS1 break my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""@CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" @PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON4. @CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME1 when my @CAPS5 was still home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @PERSON2 and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in @LOCATION4. Just being in @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to be. Espicially when I'm with my friends and family."	19	20	40
20957	8	 Each person filed in, one after the other, making a human train. The metallic red bell chimed once as each person pushed the door slightly more open. Walking in, I was enveloped by the smell of @CAPS1 food and conversations that hummed in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. To the right was a wall covered in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 symbols and meanings, while to the left were hundreds of tables already filled. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom. I so badly wanted to plop myself down at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there silently. With moms knowing what's best, she shoved me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did as she told me, like always, but made my reluctance clear. Walking over to the table with the speed of a slug and my feet dragging on the floor, I awkwardly stood in front of the circular table. Yanking out one of the chairs, I turned to my mom with a pleading look as desperation filled every fiber of my body, for I knew there was no way she would give in. Staring at these six relatives, I didn't know how I could manage to sit here the rest of the evening.  We had all gathered at a @CAPS1 restaurant for my grandpa's @NUM1 birthday. Each of his children had flown from the mainland to @LOCATION1 in order to spend this special moment with him. I hadn't seen these cousins for over @NUM2 years, and some much longer. I had already visited with them since we'd been in @LOCATION1, but I hadn't talked to them much, none the less when we were all together and forced to mingle.  With my napkin on my lap, I sat and looked at my cousins, each one staring back at me like I was an animal at the zoo. After a moment or two, they seemed to forget I was there because they averted their gaze and began talking amongst themselves. The only person at the table who I didn't feel like a complete stranger towards was my cousin, @PERSON2. She had wavy brown hair with blindingly blond highlights, sun-kissed from those bright tropical days, along with that brown @CAPS6 skin that made me jealous. We began talking, and soon I found myself enjoying the moment.  It wasn't until the food came that we actually began interacting as a group. Being teenagers with bland palates, everyone stared as the waiter brought the first dish. After asking the friendly waitress what it was we were about to eat, from her broken @CAPS7 we deciphered that they were buns with duck inside. Frantically trying to get all of the tables served in fairly constant intervals, she left our table and all of us looked at our food blankly. No one wanted to take the first bite. One of my cousins, @PERSON1, stepped up to take the masculine role as the dare devil. We all waited tentatively as he chomped down on the moist bun and swallowed. Once done chewing, he smiled and it seemed this dish had won his approval. Digging into my buns, I began to wonder if maybe these people were easy to relate to and I had made a small thing into a big ordea. From then on, I would just be myself and stop worrying about not having seen anybody for years; All I needed was to be myself.  The way the courses were set up left plenty of time to chat between each plate they brought. Since I was no longer worrying about what to say or how to say it, I easily fit into the conversations and began to relax. Shortly after the duck tray was removed from the table, it was discovered that my cousin @PERSON1, who is from @LOCATION2, pronounces certain words with an accent. Soon everybody began comparing the way we pronounce things to the way that he does. After each difference we found, we would chuckle. Things carried on like that for the rest of the @TIME1, everyone laughing at things that were only moderately funny, but we found hilarious.  It was that @TIME1 when I realized, even though you @MONTH1 be uncomfortable around a group of people who you don't know very well, finding a common ground helps you to ease that discomfort. Finding something that you all enjoy talking about @MONTH1 be hard to do, but finding something that makes you laugh is a lot easier. Laughter is something that everyone enjoys and can take part in even if they're not contributing to the conversation. By feeling as though you're a part of what's going on, you feel accepted, and that's all anyone ever wants.	20	25	45
20982	8	 One day my friends and I went to a friends house and we started playing @CAPS1 box we were laughing having an awesome time. My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk at that time and @CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose, that was also funny but gross at the same time. @CAPS6 was the sad one of the whole group that was there, we all asked him, @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 so sad @CAPS5 answered that @CAPS5 heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said that @CAPS5 would think about it @CAPS6 was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that @CAPS5 left and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS7's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. So an hour past and my friend @CAPS6 came back. @CAPS5 came and sat with us and yelled I didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, @CAPS9 happened I asked?. @CAPS5 said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly. Oh did she really say silly that's not I word i thought she knew, everyone laughed, no @CAPS6 I was just messing with you man don't get mad come on now. So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me, @CAPS5 left and all of us guys started laughing I thought that @CAPS5 was just but hurt and @CAPS5 would get over it. an hour past and my phone starts ringing and I look who's calling and it @CAPS6 s ex girlfriend. Surprised I answer and I tell her that @CAPS6 wasn't with us that I would tell him to call you later, I said that because @CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to me so I was like okay so we started talking and she is telling me that she likes me... I start cracking up in laughter. She got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing. But I told that it was cool that she did so I told her I have to go and we hanged up... I couldn't help my self i started cracking up again and so that's how my day ended in laughter and it was like that all day                                       	17	15	32
20984	8	"                     LaughterLaughter can change a lot in people,it can bring people together. It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS2 your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and I. @CAPS2 your in a relationship or a friendship, @CAPS1 able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@CAPS2 you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that's even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  My best friend and I laugh all the time, @CAPS3 can just look at me in a way I only understand and I'll know what @CAPS3 means, and then we both start laughing @CAPS2 we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don't get it. My best friend and I are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship as in having a ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @CAPS2 you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad @CAPS2 they want to hang out with there friends.  The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it's nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends, cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. Normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did that once and @CAPS3 was not happy as all in the relationship,@CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything,@CAPS3 was afraid to break up with him though cause @CAPS3 would not have any friends,cause @CAPS3 made him her life.

20998	8	" Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,""@CAPS2 come here."" I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,""@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS2 always remember that."" I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity."	20	16	36
21021	8	" My @CAPS1 year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth grade year I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course I sulked but looking back on it now I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However one can't go through life without any friends so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance however was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point.  Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends @MONTH1 not understand, but when you have no where to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends I could always share my sisters. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my @CAPS1 year. I had all knew classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did.  It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if thing might not change after all. However after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear they would have spoke quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to ""look at her, shes laughing so hard at you shes crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends."	20	20	40
21051	8	" One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1 what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS1 one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS1 still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1 a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS1 you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem.  After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS1 I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS1 muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS1 because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS1 it's still something that could make your whole day better."	27	18	42
21061	8	" It was my thirteenth birthday. I woke up on a sunny day which was odd for @ORGANIZATION1 because it was late @DATE1. I got up with excitement. I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go to work with him and i said yes. My dad is a roofer so i couldn't go on top of the houses because i was to young. I had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw. I was doing that for a while, then i got my soccer ball out of my dads truck and i started running around kicking the ball. As i was running i noticed this slippery spot. I had in mind not to go there but i forgot and i stepped on the slippery spot. i fell but while i was falling some how i kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while i was turning red and embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was slow motion.i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work. The sun was coming down, and we were heading home. we arrived at my house and i walk towards the house door and i opened it and i hear ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2, i looked around and my friends and family were there. the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a @CAPS1 party.i go and say hi to my family and friends. Then i went to go take a shower, iwas in the shower putting soap when all of a sudden the lights go out. I got scared and screamedas loud as i could. I ran out of the bathroom. Went to the the living room and the lights turn back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head im thinking why are they laughing at me? I looked down and im naked. Everybody was laughing and enjoying the moment, while i was turning pitch red and about to cry. I ran to my room, i put some clothes on. I went back to the living room and i enjoyed my party."	15	15	30
21069	8	"Laughing is one of the things we do best. @PERSON1 and I talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other crying it's their job to make the them laugh and if it is funny for both @CAPS2 know it was a job well done. In @DATE3, my uncle died, I called her crying my eyes out, she said, everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me.  @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1, at @ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week out of our @DATE1 to get to know new people and getting closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole @DATE1, though me and @PERSON1 didn't ""click"" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out we were more alike then we thought. Some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When @CAPS2 are alike @CAPS2 can talk to each other about everything, yet when @CAPS2 hit those differences, and the other disagrees it starts a fight, but fights just bring people closer together.  Even though me and @PERSON1 don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means @CAPS2 don't see them as much as @CAPS2 would like to. Even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another, but, when we do finally get to see each other there isn't a dull moment. About a month after @PERSON1 had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to skate world, @PERSON1 was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the @TIME1 full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, ""@CAPS2 wont ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun? "". By the @DATE2 @TIME1 she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and I don't regret one thing that happened that @TIME1, it was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours, before one the parents got their and after that we all went home. That is a @TIME1 I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had!  When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differently, but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine, and it @MONTH1 just make @CAPS2 laugh. somethings are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when @CAPS2 get to that point is think of something happy, or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life that I was willing to help @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me that makes this life, a life worth living. Though @CAPS2 cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more then @CAPS2 @MONTH1 know.  @PERSON1 and I have planed out many lives we would like to live and looking back now on them all I can do is laugh, because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen I doubt they will. But, it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and Believe they were going to happen for awhile and I know looking back in a few years we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @CAPS2 think of all the good times @CAPS2 have had in your life, and lets @CAPS2 know that @CAPS2 had fun in your life. Though we fight, in the @DATE2, I don't think anyone will be able to tear @PERSON1 and I apart, with all the laughter that is done. We are true friends."	19	24	42
21081	8	"@CAPS1 up kids my mother said as she was scrambling to get her stuff packed and ready.I knew exactly what i did wrong, I didn't set my alarm on my phone for six am. I set it for six pm and now we are late. Thinking to my self I hurried to get my clothes packed for the week. six pairs of pants, six pairs of shirts, six pairs of underwear, and six pairs of socks. I put my bag next to the front door realizing now that it was next to my other bag I had already packed the day before. My sisters were worse, as girls they take for ever putting on there makeup and and straightening their hair.Finally everyone is packed, but it was now seven am and we were supposed to be to @LOCATION2 by now and were still sitting here at our house. As my sisters are now done and we are in the car we can finally get off to @LOCATION3. We as a family have been planning @CAPS2 for a month and now it's @DATE2! I was really exited to go. By @CAPS2 point I had butterfly's in my stomach.We lived in @LOCATION1, we were only half way through @LOCATION2 with eight out of ten hours left to get to my mom's cousins house. I feel asleep for the first two hours of the ride and I can no longer sleep. I was stuck in the back seat with nothing to do. so I started to sing the never ending song. @CAPS2 is the song that never ends, and it goes on and on my friends."" @CAPS3 my sister in the front seat yelled at me very harshly to shut up. I didn't stop and she yet again yelled at me to stop singing. For a third time I annoyed my sister and she responded with a punch on my arm. For some reason I started to laugh. It didn't hurt and I thought it was funny that she hit me for just singing a silly song.I had a really strange laugh so my little sister started to laugh because I was laughing, then my older sister quite harshly screamed at me and my younger sister to be quite. My older sister yet again punched me trying to get me to stop laughing. By now I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath and my face was turning into a shade of purple. It really was funny when my mom couldn't hold it back any longer and started cracking up and laughing with me and my younger sister. My mom wears dentures, and she was laughing so hard they almost fell out of her mouth while she was driving, we started laughing harder. My stomach felt like it was going to explode from all the laughter.My older sister now turning a dark shade of blue from yelling at us so hard to get us to shut up. She was throwing her arms into the air and screaming one last time to shut up and threw herself back into her seat with a very nasty look of disgust on her face.over the next minute we all stopped laughing and was quiet for the next hour @CAPS3 we stopped and ate. We enjoyed our lunch and got on the road because we still had a long trip on our hands.I very soon felt tired and fell asleep in the most awkward of positions you could ever find in a car. I had my head against the door, my arm over the front passenger seat, one of my legs was on the seat and the other in between the driver and passenger seats.I thought I was pretty lucky sleeping most of the way for we only now had about a half hour till we got to my mom's cousins house. We were in the middle west of @LOCATION3 and the mountains were so beautiful. They were full of color and life with gigantic trees swinging in the wind, squirrels moving about from tree to tree, planting nuts in the ground. It was the farthest I have ever been away from where I lived in @LOCATION1. I was glad it was with my family.My stay in @LOCATION3 was a blur. I can hardly remember most of what happened there. I played with a neighbor kid around the same age as me playing video games and eating unhealthy junk food. My mom was the happiest of us all to get out of @LOCATION1 for a weekend. She had not seen her cousin in about three years and was very happy to see her.It was now @DATE1 was time to get back to our normal lives, so we packed up our stuff and were headed back to our home. I was doing amazing at not talking and making my sister mad for the first minute or so. @CAPS3 I started to sing the never ending song again. I have never laughed so hard in my life. """	20	16	36
21115	8	 There are many reasons why laughter is an important part of any relationship. In my opinion you can no be serious about everything. Laughing is a way of lettting yourself go and relieve stress. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. Laughter can help in many more ways then that.  Being serious about everything is not always a good thing. You need to have fun in your life to keep you happy. Being around people that make you laugh is always a good way to put yourself into a good mood. Laughing is a good way to take the pressure off and not be ebarressed. Being able to have a realtionship with people where you can laugh at things when they are funny is always needed. For me i know that being around people who cant laugh things off i always feel like i need to watch what i say. Laughing is one of the best way to just relax. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. If i do not feel like i can joke around and laugh with the people that i am with i usually do not feel like i can be myself. Altough if you are not comfortable with the people that you are with to start with then it might be harder for you to joke around with them. Eventually if you let yourself go and laugh you will feel closer to them. Being happy and laughing with people makes a really strong connection between people. Making things into a joke is a way alot of people keep their selfs from getting embarssed. Usually if you do something that other people think is funny and you dont, then if people laugh you might feel uncomfotable. But if you start to laugh with them it takes the pressure off you and they are not longer laughing at you but now with you.  In conclusion there are many things that laughing can do for you. It makes it so you dont have to be serious about everything, it takes the pressure off and relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things that people can do together to make a connection. No matter what laughing can always put someone in a better mood.	17	15	32
21143	8	 Laughter is the key to every friendship I have. If a person is really nice, but I cannot seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it is hard to find common ground between us. When I see my friendships and reflect on them, it reminds me of all of the great memories over the years and months that were filled with joyous laughter. The simple things that make me happy in life bring about laughter. Whenever differences become clear in friendships, it only takes a memory brought up that made us laugh, to trigger that friendship back into place.  Whenever I'm with my best friend, @PERSON1, things that normally would not be funny whatsoever, are. Another element that's put in place is the fact that @PERSON1 and I don't hang out as often as we used to, when we went to the same school @DATE1 @DATE1. So, the absence of eachother makes us treasure our times together even more than usual. Three nights ago, I went to dinner with @PERSON1 and her mom at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had numerous amounts of laughing sessions throughout dinner. Everyone who is ever around us, either think we are very annoying because we cannot stop laughing, or understand what it's like to have a best friend that makes your @DATE2 brighter, and think we're funny. There has never been a true fight between @PERSON1 and I because of how close we've become over the @DATE1 and realized how much we are like twins. So conflicts are never really brought up. However, one of my other very close friends, @PERSON2, that goes to my previous school with @PERSON1, has been having problems with @PERSON1. The most important thing to me is that they get along, because they are two of the most important people in my life. I would do anything to make them become friends like they used to be, even though I probably don't have the power to do so. I can get close into both of their hearts and stay on a level of laughter, secrets and wonderful memories. But when they are not getting along with eachother, it's not so easy to bring them together. I had been with @PERSON2 @TIME1, so I knew what she was feeling as well as @PERSON1, who I was with currently. I tried to shortly bring up the subject and at first, she rejected it. I knew that @PERSON2 meant a lot to her, and also that they had only gotten in a small arguement over something silly. The issue was that both of them can be very stubborn, and in any type of arguement, neither will say they are sorry first. It's because they both don't believe they have done anything wrong. In this case, it was a small miscommunication. I ended up going into more detail with @PERSON1 about how @PERSON2 was feeling, because I could completely relate. She later started seeing the other side of things, once I got her laughing. The key to my friendships, is laughter. Especially while we are young. There is no way I could have gotten @PERSON1 to listen to my view on @PERSON2's feelings unless they were what she wanted to hear. So, I told her what she wanted to hear. Things that made her laugh and giggle. Things that brought back memories of the good times her, @PERSON2 and I had had. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't completely ready to full out run up to @PERSON2 and hug her over and over, and make peace, she was ready to consider communicating with @PERSON2 again. That was enough for me to feel good.   The rest of the @TIME2, we put aside the drama and laid back and enjoyed the @TIME2. We played our favorite songs and were cracking up the entire @TIME2 about the tiniest things, or mistakes we made in our speech when we talked to eachother. I know that as I get older, I will look back on my two best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, and realize how they made my high school years so amazing. They brought a better person out of me, someone who can enjoy life to the fullest by being in the right crowd and having innocent fun. They taught me that you can be great friends with more than one person, and even if those two don't get along, you can find a balance and not end up excluding anyone. In the end, the important thing is that you were a good friend to everyone and weren't selfish in the mix. Laughter has brought me to that place. I find that when I'm laughing about sincerely great things, and not making fun of someone or something, I become a lot less selfish and a better friend to people, because my intent is beautiful. I wouldn't get that perspective without true friends that @CAPS3 has given me. By the @DATE2, @PERSON2 calls me and tells me that @PERSON1 called her and asked her to talk. Things will change very soon. 	20	20	40
21144	8	 Close people to you enjoy the moment you have shared with them and remembering it back brings laughter for what had occurred in that moment. Laughter brings people you have known from a long time together because you have had a feeling for that person and for the moment. Laughing at the memories that were spent with that person and enjoying it can make you closer to that person and it can be important to that relationship. In fact, it has happened to me before; laughter came to me when i saw a special video from my past. It was when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party. My cousin was very chubby and with straight hair, but that day she was very sick from fever. I was very different because i had curly hair and was short. We both had a dress on, but the dresses had different styles. Then everyone at the party was having fun and we were, too. The video got to the part when my cousin and i were bouncing up and down grabbing our dress and making a show for everyone at the party. In that time we were suppose to be dancing. It seemed we were having to much fun that day. Afterward, my youngest brother came close to where we were dancing to see us dance, but he was caring with him a cup of soda. Then one of the grown ups gets up from its chair and bumps into him and he drops his cup of soda which splashed my cousin and me. All of our dress were wet, dirty ,and sticky from the soda. We both stopped dancing and sat down on the ground and started to cry. My aunt and my mom changed us to something else, but later when we saw my brother we were so mad that we didn't answer him when he asked us something or wanted to talk to us for that fact. Later on, we were having fun again and talked to him back again. Finally, the video stopped. It's important that laughter gets people closer to someone because together they're having a great moment while laughing. My cousin and i watching the video remembering our memories made us laugh from what happened to both of us. We have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age. We noticed how much we had changed right now from all the funny times we had enjoyed together. We did realize that it was not my brothers fault for splashing us with soda. Laughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united. Obviously, in different time in life you react in a different way, but laughing in that moment or later on gets people together. Sometimes in time feelings are different, but laughing is important because you're sharing the moment of happiness with someone. I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments.  	20	20	40
21146	8	"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1! What is this??"" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story. "	24	23	47
21154	8	"Laughter is a key importance in life, family, and relationships. Gets people through tough times and times when you just need a friend. Laughing is a big part in my life, joking around and having fun, when something happens I try to cover it up with laughter. People @MONTH1 say that laughing is to much in situations, but it gets a lot a people trough tough times. @CAPS1 there was no laughter in the world in would be dull and I feel that people would be without really experience laughing and making jokes.    Making other people laugh gives me good feeling even @CAPS1 it is a lame joke. I think that because it gives me a good feeling about my self, one good thing I know how to do. My family has always been the joking type, messing around and just laughing about everything. There has been a lot of good memories with my family and I, jokes and what not. We enjoy every little laughing matter because its something we each treasure and its a bond that we do not want to loose.One moment in my life where laughter was really great for was in awkward situations with people. My sports team, getting down on ourselves very fast during games and we start to blame other people which is the most common thing that people do when they start to stress in situation like this. Causing so many errors my team mates and I are just not paying to one another and not acting like a team. Just after losing so many games you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always try's to comfort us by saying we did good or we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously or people do not care and act nothing ever happened and those people start to shut @CAPS2 out and only care for their good friend on the team. One morning before we even started things were tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members where talking about her and she confronted them saying ""@CAPS1 your going to talk about me behind my back just say it to me."" @CAPS2 was in complete shock no one knew what to say, so i stated ""well this is just awkward."" The whole team just started to laugh because it loosened @CAPS2, even though it didn't totally solve things it just made the situation a little better.Another moment in my life where laughter was a key part was during road trips. Being suck in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way back from were ever we came back it is a lot of bonding time. You start to talk crazy not making an sense, not being like yourself. Then it bring out the fun of messing around then saying something or do something were it become really funny and its a moment that you don't want lost. An example that happened to me on this experience was going to @LOCATION1 and making up a lot of inside jokes of things we saw or heard. moments like these I always want to treasure because these people in your life right now will not always be their. To create memories do the basic thing and laugh with family. Laugh with your friends.I believe that in some of these situations it could help loosen some of the tension between people, and sometimes make things a little less weird between people. Just being yourself and dont change that. Having so many of these types of moments and much more are special to me, no matter good or bad. they help me remember things easier. Just having the little moments like these are special and it reminds me of how much I really did care about this one person or realize that a moment wasn't a total lost, because it had the thoughts of people laughing and its something that comforts me. "	18	16	34
21175	8	" Day after day, people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who are laughing @MONTH1 know.There have been times in everyone's lives, where they just need to laugh. Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM1 years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest guy @CAPS1 the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself "" @CAPS11 am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing."" @CAPS1 one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS1 the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS1 going, until @CAPS2, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said "" hey @CAPS3 @CAPS21 need a ride to the river?"" and @CAPS6 laughed. "" @CAPS4 could @CAPS21 give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?"" I replied.  "" @CAPS5 I'll lend @CAPS21 a pair."" @CAPS6 said. "" I don't think @CAPS21'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass."" I replied. "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS17 i do lets go."" @CAPS6 said @CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS11 I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. "" @CAPS10 do @CAPS21 need coffee in the morning?"" I said "" @CAPS11 are @CAPS21 talking about?"" @CAPS6 replied "" The bottle."" I said "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS21 dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit."" @CAPS6 repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION3. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS6 gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS1 our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS2's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON1, looks at me and says ""@CAPS16"". and so I turn around and @CAPS6's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS6 comes over and helps me up and says, "" that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."""" @CAPS17 I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway"" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS16 up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS1 our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS19 perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS6 house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION2 all order, @PERSON1 says to me "" @CAPS20 o, @CAPS21 know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS21, @CAPS21 never spoke."" "" I had nothing to say"" I replied."" @CAPS21 know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl"". @CAPS6 said."" I know, but i cant help it"". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked."" @CAPS21 have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS21 @CAPS1 the crew"". @CAPS6 said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS2's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS24 and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship. Now to me @CAPS2 is an olderto me."	18	20	38
21177	8	"The mood was sweet and the room was worm with most of my family and friends. except for my brother and at the time i was only about @NUM1 or @NUM2? Hell i can't really remember so I'm just going to guess on the age. Whatever getting back to the story, so I'm looking all around our @NUM1 story house trying to find my brother but for some reason this time it just seems impossible. And all I can hear in the back ground is my family laughing as this little @NUM1 or @NUM2 year old is running full speed up and down hallways and opening and closing doors to rooms that hes never been in be for. And also shouting at the top of his lungs ""@CAPS1 where you be at i can't finded you"". And with one more door to open that's at the beginning of the hallway where every one is sitting or standing. This little boy comes running down the hall in a panic who can't find his brother. And opens up the door and out pops @PERSON1 his brother who is wearing the scary monster mask and says ""I will get you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner"". So know what I did just as he told me to do. I ate my dinner so fast I ended up throwing up because a was so scared that he was going to come after me that night! And the funny thing is that this happened for the @DATE1 of my life so that the funny thing."	12	15	26
21183	8	 Hi my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again.	18	18	36
21198	8	"  On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved that the most. @CAPS1 was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean its his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, thats awsome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and i went to is called @LOCATION1. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue ether. Yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I say him through the window. He turned his head and smilled, I could see all the glue still wet and it's everywhere.  My brother and me always had a good relationship, we both mad each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probable wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very importent part to any kind of relationship. It alows poth people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sence of humor you have.  As we approched the house, we saw @CAPS1 sitting on the porch waitting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS1 had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people dont come over. @CAPS1 said the whole family was coming over. My brother and i were so happy, we both new grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy. Grandma showed up alittle after dad did. @CAPS1 was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brothers face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays. When my brother was at the table @CAPS1 brang in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier.  When the birthday cake was over and the presients, my brother and i went out to the back yard to play kickball. My brother wouldnt use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play, we both were having fun. We laught every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back and as the ball came close i kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast, insted of the ball going to his feet it went to his head. When the ball conected to his head he did a back flip off the ground. @CAPS1 and grandma were in aw, i was frozen still. When he got up he looked straight at me and laught. @CAPS1 started to laugh so did grandma, i was still frozen. I finaily went with it and by the time I started i couldnt stop. it was so funny, he got pickup off the ground and hit in the head with a ball and still laughs.   When it was time for everyone to go, @CAPS1 said her good byes and then it was grandmas turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forhead than me. As grandma was leaving my brother and i sat on moms lap and gave her a big hug and said ""I love you @CAPS1"". @CAPS1 was tcking us in bed and was about to leave when my brother said "" @CAPS1 my head hurts"". I love my family and even today we look back on this and laugh. This has been a joy to write i hope you think so to.  Short story by   @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1"	17	17	34
21225	8	" Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared."	25	25	50
21233	8	"                            Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS2 also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, ""@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?"" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS2 changes people, no matter what the age."	20	20	40
21266	8	" This is the second time I have been to @ORGANIZATION1 and I can't wait to go on all the rides. The lines are extremely long but I am with some family that I haven't seen for a while so we talk and catch up. My uncle who is there with us tends to play tricks on the kids and embarrass me. He has given me wedgies, put his kids diapers under my pillow, and many more crazy tricks. I knew this trip would be no different so I tried to stay clear of any plans he had in mind. @CAPS1 was going to be a rather warm day today so I put on some basketball shorts and a t-shirt. We headed out with five kids under the age of @NUM1 so I knew we would be going on some smaller rides. After we went on ""@CAPS1's a small @ORGANIZATION1"", we decided @CAPS1 was time to go to the bigger rides but we would need some lunch first. We went to a burger shop and were waiting to get our food, so me and my uncle decided to have a spit ball war. We were shooting across the isle from table to table trying to dodge people walking by. I hit him twice in the side of the cheek so he told me I had won.  Once we ate our food and went outside to leave he told me, ""@CAPS2 see who can hold your little brother above their head for the longest"". I not thinking about @CAPS1 said, ""That's easy!"" and lifted my brother up. Little did I know that was a big mistake. He walked over and pants-ed me in the middle of the walk way. I stood there with a kid above my head and my pant's at my ankles. People sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen. I was so embarrassed, how could I be so stupid to fall for his trick. I couldn't believe I had fallen for @CAPS1 again. @CAPS1 happened so fast and I didn't know what to do other then chuckle inside. After that we decided to head to space mountain to get some fast passes. They allowed for you to not have to wait in line and go to the front, but they could only be used for certain times. We had to wait for about twenty minutes and @CAPS1 was raining. So we put on our blue @ORGANIZATION2 ponchos and the kids were playing tag. My brothers were the loud crazy kids that always have energy and don't stop running. They would keep coming up behind me and hitting me in the back and running away. After about the fifth time I couldn't take @CAPS1 anymore so I told them if they hit me again, they were going to get hit back. After about two minutes I got hit in the back again so I turned around and walked up to a kid in a blue poncho and hit him on the back of the head. Little did I know I had just hit a random little kid in the back of the head. I felt horrible as the kid looked up at me with a blank stare wondering what had just happened. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree as my my uncle and parents were apologizing for what I had done. Although my family was embarrassed for what I had done they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time. I had no idea that the kid wasn't my brother and could only imagine what that kid was feeling like."	19	19	38
21273	8	Most people think that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and show who you really are. I believe all of that is true, laughter is one of the most important things a person can do. In my life laughter has helped me threw the hardest situations and made them a lot better. You can laugh a lot with friends, family, or people you barely even know. Laughing can mend relationships and help you get threw anything, in my life i have found that out many times.My mother and myself haven't always had the best relationship, we don't always get along, and since i have a severe separation anxiety from her we spend a lot of time together which can cause friction from being together too much. There was a certain time when we had just gotten into a fight about me wanting to go somewhere and her not letting me, i was expecting her to be mad at me for awhile for how rude i was being. We didn't talk for a couple hours and tried to stay away from each other, we would only talk to each other if it was really important. After a couple days of this going on i went into her room to talk to her about it all, when we talked i understood why she was so mad at me and i apologized and left her room, but i could still feel that there was some tension between us. I wanted to make things better more then i have ever wanted anything, i wasn't really sure if she was ready to get over this fight, so i thought it would be better to give her some space and let her come to me when she was ready to talk. We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about. The next day we went to go do somethings around town, some grocery shopping and to see some family. In the beginning we didn't really talk much or anything. Within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together we were joking around and laughing at everything each other said. After our errands we went out to lunch, it was the funnest time i had ever had with my mom, we talked about everything and laughed and had an amazing time. The days after that were wonderful also, we spent a lot of time together and felt like we didn't want to leave each other, i know that laughing together and talking really helped with that, we opened up to each other like we never had before. I love my mother and care for her more then anyone in the world, when we got into that fight i was scared out relationship would never be the same again, we were able to work it out by laughing. I honestly think that laughter can cure anything, from a broken heart to a broken family.	17	17	34

After that we got to talking i started making him laugh and eventaully he said ""you make me laugh i like that i will buy some"". I think that the laughter pklayed a key roll in him buying the cookie dough."	10	11	21
21348	8	"  In all of our lives there is that one person that is so special you would never do anything to hurt them. Whether that person be a close friend, a significant other, or a family member. The people that are involved in our lives significantly are there to help us through the rough patches, bring us up when we are down, and be there for us. Friends are one of the most important people we have in life. Friends are someone we can talk to and they understand, someone we share everything with including clothes, food, etc. They are the ones that get us through each day with a smile. High school is filled with drama, it's the same old story just, a different day. I have the best group of friends, we are very close and spend a lot of time with each other at school and outside of school. They are there for me when I need them the most. Recently this guy, @PERSON1 and I have been trying to work on our relationship but he had been lying to me and cheating on me but everyone of my friends that I talk to abut the situation say the same thing, ""he is going to hurt you"" and ""he's not worth your tears."" I have class with him every other day. It's not like I get to choose when I want and don't want to see him, some days are just better than others. The bell rang, right after lunch, and I wasn't in any hurry to get to the band room. The band room is very big, smells like old cheese and is like a trampoline for sound to bounce off of and explode in your face. I don't enjoy that class at all. I walked in the room nonchalantly and set all my books on my chair and began walking to my cubby. I grabbed my instrument walked back to set it on my chair and went to talk with some of my friends. It hadn't been a bad day so far, it was just a regular day at school. Entering the band room I had a feeling that @DATE1 was different. He walked through the band door with a huge smile on his face but I couldn't help but look away and frown. Mixed emotions are the worst, he does one thing and you love him and he does another thing that drives you insane and makes you want to hurt him. He sits right behind me in band and I am constantly turning around to talk to him but we never seem to get in trouble except for @DATE1, we were supposedly talking to much. I don't believe we were talking to much, because @DATE1 was where I wanted nothing to do with him. He was upset with me and I was upset with him, so we were even. Twenty-five minutes passed by, each minute dragging on longer and all I was thinking about was him and what I had heard he was doing. It's never a good feeling when you know something is wrong. I confronted him about what people were telling me. His response was ""don't believe what you hear, believe what you see."" I didn't know what was going on, but tears started pouring out of my eyes, running down my face like a crystal clear waterfall. I asked my teacher if i could take a minute out in the hall, and she agreed, so I sat in the hall, with tears running down my face. One of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me. We started talking and I told her everything that was going on. She gave me a hug, and start making jokes about him. I couldn't help but laugh. I even smiled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well. After a few jokes, and a bunch of hugs, the tears went away and I was smiling. Neither of us wanted to go back in class but we didn't really have any other options. We weren't very close friends, but our talk during class, made us grow stronger. Even when everything is going wrong, you should count on your friends to tell you the truth, and give their advice, because they are always right so don't second guess them. They know how to make you feel better and it always seems to work. Laughter is much more than an emotion. It gives you strength when you are weak. It builds you up when you are down. Laughter brings relationships closer, and sometimes all we need is to smile. Laughter also helps create memories, the nights you stay up talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever. Laughter is an important aspect to everyone, we all need a day to just relax and take a step back to laugh."	20	19	40
21356	8	" In all of the times people paid a lot of attention to laughter. We can't imagine our lives without @CAPS9. We @CAPS8 every day, make jokes,smile. For me laughter always was one of the best things in the world! @CAPS9 helped me so many times in the most difficult situations. I want to tell you one story of my life when laughter played a huge role.@CAPS9 all started @DATE1 in @DATE2. I was living in @LOCATION2 at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to the @LOCATION2 for one @DATE1 as an exchange student. To do this I had to pass a lot of tests, to write millions of essays, go through all the paper work... One of the things that i had to do was to talk to the group of other participants and two @CAPS1 for about one hour. So, people who chose the kids to go abroad will look at how we can communicate with others. Can you imagine speaking foreign language with group of people who you have never seen before? No. Especially when all of you know that only one from the whole group will go to @LOCATION1. You know that everyone will try to be the best, the leader, and hardly ever will let others to say something. But I still hoped everything would be fine.I remember that day as if @CAPS9 was yesterday. Everything in details. @CAPS9 was @DATE3 @TIME1, when I came into the white big building of @ORGANIZATION1 where the competition was going to be.I came in the class and two @CAPS1 introduces us to each other. And at that exact moment, when I saw other three people, at that exact second I realized that I actually had to worry! I saw their faces. They thought the same. We had nothing in common. At all. They all looked different. One girl was all in black. No kidding. black big shoes looked alike to old army ones that my grandfather has, black skirt was longer then the girl, black ties, dark t-shirt, three or four sizes bigger then the girl; you can not even imagine how dark her short straight hair were. She looked like if she was a part of the darkest night of the @DATE1. Another girl was a complete ""barbie girl"". You know, typical @CAPS3- two good for everyone. She was tall, thin, long blond hair and pink clothes. All pink. Bright-pink jeans, light-pink top and high heels. I remember her saying the girl in black something like "" @CAPS4, I am the best one here"". Nothing else about her, just @CAPS3. Also there was one boy. He was a wonderful example of rap person. All his look from shoes to attitude were just screaming about how much he likes rap. No, loves rap. Big blue jeans, cool in rep companies @ORGANIZATION2 shoes, white tee-shirt with a face of popular in @LOCATION2 rap musician, a hoodoo and a big hat. Also, he had a backpack and i was able to hear music from his I-pod. Well, me, I was in new green pants, grey top, black cardigan, nice grey purse and black flats.. I looked like a girl who loves style, I guess. I can not tell you what they thought about me. I just don not know. But I'm pretty sure that I was a person who just reads magazines all the time and watching @CAPS6 fashion shows. So, we all looked super different from each other and seemed as we were interested just in our own thing. And in nothing else.I didn't understand how we were able to be in the same group. But we were. The first ten minutes were awkward. We did not know what to talk about since we all were so different. Two @CAPS1 who were making notes on how how our conversation is going decided to help us.They gave us a random word, something like "" jungadzhumba"" and told us to think about what @CAPS9 is and to perform @CAPS9. That seemed to be an interesting thing to me but not for others. The girl-in-black said that @CAPS9 is stupid. And then, the next second the thing that changed everything happened. The boy said a joke about @CAPS9. Yes, just a joke, and i do not even remember what @CAPS9 was, the only thing is that @CAPS9 was really funny. We started to @CAPS8. And the laughter helped us. We were talking so long, more than one hour, but @CAPS9 seemed for us so fast! We were talking about everything in the world! So many topics, we were talking in that room, and then after in the restaurant, and in the subway on the way home... @CAPS9 was wonderful time! That day is very important for me now, because at that day I realized that laughter is a key for everything. I've heard @CAPS9 before, but the real understanding was at that @DATE3. Now my favorite phrase is: ""@CAPS8, if you don't know what to do, just @CAPS8!"" @CAPS9 will help you."	17	20	37
21365	8	" People say ""laughter can cure anything"", @CAPS6 you know what I totally believe it to. There has been multiple times when I was sad or angry that someone made me laugh, and I have made almost everyone I know laugh when they were down our frustrated. Now, many people have made me laugh throughout my whole sixteen years that i have been alive. To be completely honest, I only really remember one moment in my life that really laughter was all I needed to pull me back to reality. My best friend @PERSON2 really knew what i need to help me out. her humor made my life real again, and because of it I was able to except life. It was @DATE1, when I got really upset because I knew that the guy I loved since seventh grade wouldn't date me again. His reason for this was because he didn't want to ruin our great and close friendship. Just because he said that didn't mean I would just give up. I tried @CAPS2 to win him back, but it just seemed like nothing was working. At this point I knew I needed to talk to my best friend, so I text-ed @PERSON2. I told her @CAPS2 I was doing, and how none of it was working. If you knew @PERSON2, you would know that @CAPS1 sees a bright side to anything @PERSON2 told me at that time, ""@PERSON1, you can have any guy ion the world, and yet, you can't seem to realize it. I don't know about you, but you must be really @CAPS3 sick!"" @CAPS1 said that once or twice because @CAPS1 knew it was true. I still just couldn't except what @CAPS1 was telling me. that never stopped me from smiling or laughing though. I'll admit those words really dried my tears up. and helped me move forward. Now it is @DATE2 time, school is out, and it's time for me to step my game up. I was still trying to win @PERSON3, the @CAPS3 of my life back. Once again I tried @CAPS2! I even asked @PERSON2 to ask @PERSON3 if he still had feelings for me. He never gave her an answer. When I asked @PERSON2 for more advice, @CAPS1 responded like usual. ""@PERSON1, @PERSON3 is just one guy, there are plenty of guys out there for you. You just need to look and stop trying for just one guy"". This got me thinking. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 is totally right, I just need to find a guy that makes me feel the same way @PERSON3 makes me feel. Don't get me wrong though, even though @PERSON2 was trying to be serious, I couldn't help but smile a little, and giggle. As I was giggling, I though t to myself. I still @CAPS3 @PERSON3 like crazy. It's the beginning of @DATE2, and I am just relaxing at my house like usual, when I get a text from @PERSON3 saying he might be moving to @LOCATION1. I just started bawling like a baby who is hungry. I quickly text ed @PERSON2 to tell her, but @CAPS1 already knew. I had one more plan to win @PERSON3 back, and I told @PERSON2 all about it. My plan is to ask @PERSON3 if he wants to hike @CAPS4. Pisqah with me before he moves. When we hiked all the way to the top I am going to tell him how I truly still feel about him, then I am going to kiss him.m @CAPS5 @PERSON2 read this, her first response was, "" @CAPS6 shoot girly, aren't you just a spitball of @CAPS3 and romance!"" I almost peed my pants when I read that. It was hysterical! My plan never happened because @PERSON3 ended up not moving thankfully. Quintin and I still haven't got back together, but I am fine with that. His and I's friendship has grown tremendously. I'll admit though that I can't help but flirt with him a lot. Luckily though, I had my best friend @PERSON2 to talk to. @CAPS1 is the reason my tears and moans turned to tears of happiness and laughter. @PERSON2's humor brought me to except-ants. laughter kept me in perspective of @CAPS2. I owe all my thanks to @PERSON2, who kept me from going insane or crazy about @CAPS2. Laughter helped mend my heart, and change my whole life dramatically. "	19	18	37
21386	8	" During the @DATE1 of the sixth grade @CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON1's house.   ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 father"" @CAPS4 @CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5, @CAPS8's @CAPS9?"" I asked him.   ""@CAPS10 need to come home, @CAPS10 @CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers."" @CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS9 in @CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue @CAPS8 was happening, I was only @NUM1 and vaguely knew @CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS9 the phone and ran into @PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS4 @CAPS18 or @CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about @CAPS8 @CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS8 @CAPS4 father was doing, where @CAPS4 @CAPS18 was, and whether or not @CAPS4 sisters were @CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS9 the phone on @CAPS4 father. I had never hung @CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS4 @CAPS18 came to pick me @CAPS9 after @CAPS4 two week extended stay at @LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS4 @CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON1's @CAPS14 had called mine several times during @CAPS4 stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS8 was I supposed to do? @CAPS4 parents were splitting @CAPS9! @CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS4 street and drove towards @CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS4 room, leaving @CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS4 bed longing for @CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS9 in the @TIME1 on @CAPS4 own. There were so many things that @CAPS4 father did that @CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS4 @CAPS18 sent me and @CAPS4 sisters to @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house in @LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS8 was happening. @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS4 @CAPS5, not @CAPS4 @CAPS17 or @CAPS4 @CAPS18, just @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and maybe @PERSON1.  When I came home from @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS8 was going on and how @CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS12 was, so @CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS4 father called me at @LOCATION1's house."	21	19	42
21412	8	" embarrassing laughterHave you ever thought some thing was really funny where you felt like you where going to pee your pants? Or have you felt like the side of your stomach was going to explode because you where laughing @CAPS1 hard? well this happened to me it was all @CAPS1 crazy like a dream it was during my @NUM1 grad @DATE1 to be exact. My brother @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 and i where walking through the park minding are own bissness just trying to have a good time. My brother was talking to @LOCATION1 about this really funny joke that he herd at school i don't remember the joke but i do remember how funny it was because i nearly peed my pants it was @CAPS1 embarrassing but at the same time funny i don't no why though. @CAPS1 i told them if they don't stop telling each other jokes i might pee my pants. But of cores what any brother would do is just keep on going they thought it was just @CAPS1 funny well not me i thought it was mean and painful if you no what i mean because i had a full balder. My friend @PERSON1 the sweet, loving person she is suggested to go find a bathroom, @CAPS1 off we went on the mission to find a bathroom @PERSON3 my brother said ""well i believe that there is a bathroom up this hill lets check it out and see if it is open @CAPS1 @PERSON2 can go to the bathroom"". little did we no that it was @DATE2 and the bathrooms where closed for the workers to come in and clean.when we mad it all the way up the hill i latterly ran to the bathroom i never felt this way before it was just @CAPS1 painful i could not put it into words.soon enough i found out the doors where locked i was @CAPS1 mad and devastated. @PERSON3 and @ORGANIZATION1 thought it was funny because i had to pee really bad and the bathroom was close they where laughing @CAPS1 hard, but i got tired of hearing them @CAPS1 i ditched them to go find the closes bathroom sadly it was a mile away that mad me @CAPS1 mad i wanted to cry.

21415	8	 For my family laughter is important to us because it just means that my parents aren't fighting that day. I was about nine years old and it was the week of @DATE1. My parents had been fighting all day, for me it seemed like it would never end. Usually @DATE1 was what I looked forward to all year, but now I just wanted it to be over. I hated seeing my parents fight, because it always scared my little brother. My little sister was too young to know what was going on, but whenever they started fighting around her, she started to scream and yell. When my parents fought I tried to keep my brother and sister busy but that never kept me busy. I still heard everything they said and it seemed to never stop.  My sister was about one year old and when my parents fought she came into my room a lot because it was the farthest room from where the yelling was going on. We would watch @CAPS1 and play games until it stopped. Once, it went on for so long that she fell asleep in my room and I ended up taking her to her bed that night. There were so many times where I wished my parents would just stop fighting and realize that it not only makes them upset, it made all of us upset.  Well, the day before @DATE1 eve my mom was at work and my dad had to go to work too. Since my moms work doesn't allow kids to be there, my dad took us along. I could tell he had been up late because he had dark circles under his eyes and he had forgotten to shave that @TIME1. Since, we were all on break from school, my whole day was spent making sure my little sister didn't get into mischief or get hurt. I had fun at my dads work because I loved playing with my little sister. My sister still wobbled when she walked so it made me laugh when we would play tag because she could never run fast enough and it made me laugh just to see her try. She loved it too because walking now gave her so much more freedom but she got herself into a lot more mischief now. On days when my dad didn't have much to do, he would have me help him try and teach my brother how to ride a two wheeler. It was a lot of fun seeing my brother try new things and have fun with it. It made us all laugh that day because he was so excited and happy that he could do something that he couldn't do before.  When @DATE1 eve came my parents agreed to stop fighting for the next few days because they wanted us to be happy on @DATE1 @TIME1. Except that night they had a really big fight after they thought all of us had gone to bed. I had stayed up that night really late cause I was watching a bunch of my favorite @CAPS2 movies. I had just turned the @CAPS1 off when I heard them yelling. I didn't get much sleep that night because of all the yelling and screaming. Luckily, my brother and sister were already asleep and I didn't have to worry about them. The next @TIME1, I didn't know what to expect from my parents. Everything was how it normally was on @DATE1 @TIME1. There were gifts under the tree and stuff in our stockings. My brother came in and woke me up and said that everyone was out in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed. I got out of bed, put my robe and my slippers on and went out to the living room. What I saw when I got out there was not at all what I had expected. My brother was sorting the presents so that everyone had their own pile. My dad was laughing at my sister, who was trying to pick up a presents that was as tall as her. And my mom was in the kitchen making everyones favorite breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and sausage. Everyone seemed so much happier then they had been the last few days.  As we all ate our breakfast and opened presents, I realized this was the first @TIME1 in a while that my parents haven't fought. It made me really happy to see them getting along. We all laughed and had a great time that @DATE1 @TIME1. The rest of the day was great too. Laughter is still a big part in my family, even though my parents are separated now. It's a lot better now because we have a lot more moments of laughter and being happy then being upset and having to listen to them fight all the time. Now that we are happy and laugh a lot more, being at home is alot better. I really do believe laughter plays a big part in any family.	20	15	35
21419	8	The @CAPS1 of Laughter   The @CAPS1 of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. Laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. In all of my relationships I have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. I have come to notice lately that I have an amazing best friend. @PERSON1 is always here for me even after the mistake I made that ended tearing us apart. Now that we have gotten over The @CAPS2 and can laugh about it, I've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it.   The @CAPS2 began last @DATE1 during my @CAPS4 soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. It was the hardest thing to admit that I had done wrong; both to her and him. The day we had gotten caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The @CAPS2 has also become a big learning point in my life, I've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I should actually do.   When I first started soccer for @CAPS4, I had never played with any of the people and I realized that by being the youngest on a @NUM1 team I would have to stand out and prove myself. Which is exactly what I did; just not to the whole team. After playing for about two weeks I had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. I hadn't really thought much about it but when both me and him started to pursue our relationship it became a whole other thing. The boy and I had been dating for about a month and a half when this began to involve @PERSON1. See we weren't exactly allowed to hang out or even date for that matter, but we knew that we would take the chance of getting into trouble for each other. And as time went on and we had began to get closer to each other, we also had began falling in love. That @MONTH1 have been the reason I had chosen what I had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense.    Then the @ORGANIZATION1 came around and we thought it would be the perfect time to see each other, little did we know this choice would result in us losing each other, me losing my freedom, both of us ruining my parent's trust and the worst of all me throwing away a great friend. We didn't think of these consequences so we went through with it. He would meet me at the @ORGANIZATION1 and I would tell my parents that I was just going to be with @PERSON1. At the beginning and throughout most of the time everything was going well me and him were having an amazing time because we could finally hang out with one another and nobody knew what was really going on. Little did I know that my mother had called @PERSON1's mom to make sure that I was going to be were I said and with who I said, and as soon as she found out I wasn't everything went down hill from there.    It had already been a couple hours and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the greasy food at the @ORGANIZATION1 so we decided to take yet another chance and leave, with me leaving @PERSON1 at the @ORGANIZATION1 and her not knowing were I went. As my mom became more and more worried she starting calling @PERSON1 to see were I was and of course @PERSON1 had no idea. On her list to call next was me. When my mom first tried calling me I decided not to answer and have her think i was just on a ride or something, but when she kept calling I knew that something was wrong. As I answered the phone I knew that she knew what I had been doing, but I still didn't want to believe what was happening. I thought that the only way my mom could have found out was because @PERSON1 called and told her that she couldn't find me and who I was with.    So that is what I ended up accusing @PERSON1 of for at least a month after it happened. I couldn't look at her or even talk to her with out feeling resentment and embarrassment. When everything finally settled down, from being caught to being grounded the whole @DATE2, I knew that I needed to apologize for the position I put @PERSON1 in. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. But now knowing that @PERSON1 and I can laugh about it makes remembering that time so much easier and better.	20	23	43
21422	8	" Laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together. The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them. These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly. I think the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is extremely accurate for most. I have many memories of laughter with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them. When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times. When we did get along we usually had so much fun, ended up rolling around laughing together, and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, bored games, and our favorite thing of all was tickle monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did. Most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people wasn't very fun at the time. He usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories. When the three of us got together and played games I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at that point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house. Me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink, under beds and in closets. We couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into even for a little kid. My dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors. He was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him. One of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like. We were inpatient little kids so we didn't usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way. Instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid, he started to chase us around the house. We weren't expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breath. Eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever! My brother thought we should hide under my parents blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target for my dad the tickle monster.  By the time he was done tickling us, our faces were red, we were out of breath, tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing. Trying to breath, trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out. My dad eventually got us out to the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our belly's full and as happy as could be.  That was a really fun memory I have with lots of laughter and good times. To me, laughing is a big part of getting to know someone and strengthening already existing relationships. It puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy."	21	20	41
21428	8	     In order to to laugh you have to be happy. I was once happy until I made mistakes. The mistakes I've made me more dissapointed in myself than anything else I could think of. I sit in a room that I don't want to because of my actions. My life was perfect before I had my brothers my parents and my love of my life. Now I look back on how nothing is worth taking me away from them. The laughs I'm missing out on right now is what hurts most, because I could be at home or even at school right now. Instead I'm here without my laughs, my brothers, my parents, and my love. Trying to put a smile on my face even though I know I'm happy. My life was one of the best lives you could have asked for, but because of my actions I ruined it. Every moment I got to have with my beautiful babygirl, in other words my love. I cherished the time I had with her and now i have to wait to have a laugh with her. I get about fourty five minutes to and hour and a half every day to talk to her and my family and it deffinently hurts more then what you could imagine. having to talk on the phone that you can barely hear their threw it just kills me. Knowing that everything I've done has effected me and my family. Alot effects my brothers though and I know they don't understand but hopefully one day they will. hearing my little brother @CAPS1 over the phone crying because he can't see me. It just hurts inside even writing about this right now makes me want to just break down in tears. I almost fell like could in front of these other kids that are in here too. My family is my main priority and when i get out I gonna make sure to get back on track for my family. So I can have the laughs that I want now.   In the @DATE1 I would have never guessed that I'd be here where I'm at now but when I get home I'm gonna put a smile on my brothers face and my parents and when I see my girl I'm gonna go give her the biggest smoochie boo kiss of her life so she'll cry and laugh.	15	15	30
21446	8	 Once, a very long time ago I laughed very hard with a friend is when some kid hit the floor falling and started to cry.There was water on the ground and he was soaked. The janitor was wiping the floor with water. the kid was not payingany attention at all to the janitor. The janitor was also a mean person, he was mad at the boy for stealing stuff from the school janitor's closet. The boy was also mad because the janitor was mean to him I was in @NUM1 grade and I didn't know any better. I had to say that I was sorry because the teacher caught meand my friend laughing,and told me the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt bad, and apologized right away. I told the kid that I didn't mean anything by it, that it was just a reaction.The boy was able to laugh at himself and he and I became friends. I feel that this small event in my life changes me for the better. I am not so quick to laugh at others misfortunes @CAPS1, people are stupid all over the world, no one is perfect. Everyone is different and unique in the own way. The world never be as one, their will always be war all the time forever on earth.	16	14	30
21463	8	"@NUM1)I heard one true story about one normal @CAPS1 businessman. he wasn't that high levelin his company. @CAPS2 he always say hello to everyone in company with his big laugh.One day, the boss of company came to his company and asked everyone  who doingwork hardest?"" @CAPS2 nobody didn't answer that question. then the boss said ""or recommendsomeone for promote level"" and then everyone recommended that business man. Becausehe always say hello to everyone with big laugh. and he goes to highest level in his company except the boss. what I'm trying to say is the laugh make people happier. and when i was with my friends,laugh was make us more friendly. also laugh is good for health too. If you laugh a lotyour life is getting way more longer than before. of course it is good for mind too.that business man wasn't very good worker. He just made everyone happier to his laugh.that's why he could be a highest level of the company.I think laugh is really good for everything. and I also laugh a lot. I want people make happier."""	13	12	25
21468	8	All the great memories that @LOCATION2 and I, spent and shared together when we were really good bestfriends. We were around @NUM1 years old and in @NUM2 through @NUM3 grade. Ofcourse we got older as the years went by, but we had soo many great times together. When ever we hung out, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time we would just never let alot of stupid things get to us. Whenever I needed someone to talk to she would be the one. She went through a life that was almost the same as what I went through in life, and so she knows what I or even she needs to do or say. Even though we would always have lots of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but alwways work things out. We'd always have each others back for everything. I guess what im trying to say is that, two people who are close always have their great needs and feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship. Here are some times that @LOCATION2 and I shared and spent together that pretty much led up to laughter.I remember in @NUM2 grade, both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could. We were still young so it was hard to do be able to do anything becuase our parents wouldnt let us most the time. Whenever we did though, we would think about random games, and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older though we were trusted more and could do lots more of things, which was a good thing. Then I moved to @LOCATION1, not the greatest thing, but it was for love. What made it better was that she still came over all the time. We would go and pick her up on @DATE1 and then on @DATE2 my mom would drive to school because my mom still went to work there in florence. Every night that she was there we would always stay up. I remember that I would always keep these little hot chocalate packages in my room and after my parents went to bed we'd sneak out to go get hot water for it so that we would have hot chocalate to drink. Some other times we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer. It was hard sometimes because my room was right across from my parents room and at the time I had beads hanging from my door. Fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught. Sometimes when she came over she would bring all her make up and things so that we could dress each other up. One night we had blind folds on and do each others makeup.	16	19	35
21494	8	"Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On @DATE1 the morning of my @NUM1 birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that ""things were going to be okay"". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will @CAPS1 be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for @NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter. Growing up my mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine"". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that ""sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?"" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends."	20	20	40
21502	8	"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said "" oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to ""quotidian teens."" I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said "" hello @PERSON3, good luck in track."" @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said ""@CAPS16, you talked to your husband."" We laughed for a long time. @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @CAPS20 music, @CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; @CAPS3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you @CAPS3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you @CAPS3 if it is as @PERSON1 said ""jump of a cliff, @CAPS3 built your wings on the way down,"" or someone will help you built them!  As @PERSON6 said ""come take my hand, we'll walk this road together.""   "	20	18	38
21537	8	 In the @DATE1 of @NUM1' I spent two weeks at my aunt's house. At the time my cousins were living with her. My cousins and I are very close so we liked to spend time together. On evening we decided to watch a movie. I remember it was called my bestfriend's girl. So we started to watch the movie and it was super funny, we laughed constantly through out it. My cousin named @PERSON1 has an awesome laugh, everytime he started to laugh I couldn't help but laugh too. We watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food. We were all in a very good mood, making jokes and doing crazy things to make each other laugh or be funny. My cousins would change their voices, making then higher or lower repeating lines from the movie or just making things up. That night we ate @ORGANIZATION1. When we got back to my aunt's house none of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night program called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was a program composed of a bunch of short cartoons. They were all very funny. We would make fun of them and laugh and mimic what the characters did.  We stopped watching it at about @NUM2 in the @TIME1, I was very tired but my cousins were not. For awhile we just sat on the couches and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid things that would make us laugh. About a hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while I was staying there. It was probably the best time of that @DATE1. I was very happy and enjoyed my @DATE1 because of my two cousins and the time we spend together. I laughed so much that my stomach would hurt all the time, but I didn't care because I was happy. I still spend time with my cousins and laugh a lot. I believe that our time spent together and shared laughter has brought us closer and more involed in each others lives. A person who can laugh, knows how to have a good time, and is fun to be around.	16	17	33
21571	8	                                                The Laughter In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are so many elements in a person's life that are important. Many are to make friends, be successful, but mostly to find happiness. Everyone wants happiness in their life right? The biggest form of happiness comes from your heart. Many believe that laughter comes from your heart and is believed to make you and others around you truly happy. One element to laughter being important in a relationship would be optimism to your partner and friends. This shows people that you aren't just a pessimistic, rude, unhappy person all the time. You can actually enjoy life and have a good time.After all no one wants to hang out with someone who is always negative and only looks at the bad things. Your partner will get sick of you and you will lose friends. Being able to laugh and joke around with people makes life a whole lot easier.It @MONTH1 not seem like much but it takes some stress off your shoulders if you have a good time and kick some giggle's. Another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laugh. What if you get a boyfriend our girlfriend and they had never heard your laugh before and once they heard your laugh they thought it was the most annoying thing in the world? Studies show they would be more than likely to leave you. On that note, if you do have a terribly annoying laugh and that is the reason you dont want to laugh, I would stick with smiling because us girls have pretty cute smiles that let us get away with alot. Lastly, @CAPS2 is one more main part of laughter being important in a relationship and that is happiness. You need to laugh to to be happy. Without laughter what is a smile? Without laughter how will happiness shine through? Lif e can get pretty boring when all you do is act like a mime. No smiling, no laughing, not fun! When you laugh, it helps others to laugh and have a good time. Plus, its fun! Like when you laugh so hard you cry or when you need to go to the bathroom really bad and it makes it worse when you start busting up laughing. Laughing makes memories. And memories are a very important part of growing up. So now that you have learned these three elements as to why or how laughing is important to anyones life, relationship or friendship, go out and laugh. It will make you feel a whole lot better. :)	20	20	40
21582	8	" I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities. I have lots of stories of when I have maid people laugh. One time i was on my way to camp with some of my friends and I looked out the window and saw a sign. ""@CAPS1 butts, unless, that ""@CAPS2"" is an ""@CAPS3"" @CAPS7 @CAPS8 must be @CAPS1 @CAPS4."" I said. @CAPS8 was so funny i maid everyone in the car laugh. @CAPS7 later on, on the drive to camp with my friends we stopped at @CAPS5 in some city. When we stopped there I got inside a shopping basket and my friends and I were racing down the isles and maid all the other costumers laugh. When we where going to leave I bought a whole bunch of food. When we were back inside the car I crabbed the box of doughnuts I had bought and let everyone else in the car have one. We all started eating them and we had established that the doughnuts where really gross. The doughnuts tasted so dry, @CAPS8 was like they didn't even have any frosting on them. I opened my chocolate milk and I had to drink my chocolate milk with my doughnut just to make @CAPS8 taste a little bit more sweet. None of us had anymore doughnuts. @CAPS8 was so funny, we threw the doughnuts out the window. On the way back from the camp that we had gone to, my friend @PERSON1 was driving home and I sat behind him and I messed with him so much. I had turned my phone up onto its highest volume and played a scary ring-tone and I scared him and maid him jump. @CAPS7 I had licked my finger and put @CAPS8 inside his ear @CAPS7 he freaked out, because he thought @CAPS8 was really gross. After that he had his window open and I opened my window and stuck my hand around and grabbed his arm and scared him. @CAPS7 we had stopped by the store in some small town and god some soda and I bought a soda to drink. When we got back in the car and left I Said: ""@CAPS6't get pulled over, I just opened a beer. Haha."" @CAPS7 I took a drink of my soda and as I took the drink I started laughing again and some of my soda went up into my nose @CAPS7 I said: ""@CAPS8 burns so bad. My nose is burning."" All of us where laughing. The ironic part was that like thirty minutes after i had said that we got pulled over. We where driving down the highway and my friend @PERSON1 who was driving thought that the speed limit was sixty-five miles-per-hour but the speed limit was fifty-five. The cop pulled him over and clocked him doing seventy-five. I was gonna try and make the cop laugh, to see if we could lighten him up a little, but my friend @PERSON1 said no because he was so mad. He ended up getting a ticket and the cop was a real idiot. He looked at the license plate and @CAPS7 turned and asked @PERSON1 if they where @LOCATION1 plates, when clearly they said right on them @LOCATION1. Everyone in the car laughed so hard @CAPS8 was hilarious. The cop was really dumb. I @CAPS6't think that anyone who went with me to camp that weekend stopped laughing. I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities."	19	15	34
21586	8	 When I think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. The happest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the coach. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him everythime. He had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plad tucked in shirt. We always played gold fish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run twards him when my other cousin @PERSON2 grabs me and starts to tickle me tell I fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON1 as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS3 tell I feel asleep.  The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up, when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchenI shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON1 and I startded to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curld up by the bales. Almost every foot step we took there was another snake curld up in the bales. Every time @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting @PERSON1 figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON1 cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON1 finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visite in the house. @PERSON1 and I headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit.  The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done. When we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as I stood by @PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving good bye.  After we visited @DATE1 we got a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with some bad news. @PERSON2 was heading home and saw @CAPS5 truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE2 and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS5 room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him.	18	21	39
21594	8	"      It was midsummer, and i could feel the cool ocean breeze washing over my skin. You would think everything would be calm, but it was the exact oppasite.I wouldnt talk to him or even look at him. He was trying so hard to get me to laugh but i just couldnt. I was so furious with him that i thought nothing between us would ever bee the same again. I thought that our three months together was up, and it scared me so much. He left for his trip the next day, and he left without saying a word.       I cried myself to sleep for a week. I knew he was back in town already, but he hadent called or said anything to me. After weeks of wondering and waiting, i could feel th at it was over. I talked to my sister and she told me that he would come around again and i had to be patient. I tried to take her words in my heart and i wanted to believe that it was true. I called his house everynight, but everynight i got the same answer, ""he's not home, but i'll let him know you called"". i wanted to believe that i would hear from him, so to pass the time i kept my self busy with cleaning and going out with my family. A couple of day's of not thinking and worrying about him did me good. I was smiling and laughing again. I felt like i could begin to breath a little and have fun. My sister's advice ended up working cos a week later he called me and told me that he wanted to see me. I told him he could come by @DATE1 and that i was very excited to see him again. The call ended and i was smiling from ear to ear.            The next couple of day's i was in a complete fenzy, getting everything clean, figuring out what i was going to wear. Everyone thought i was going crazy, but the truth is that i was scared. Scared of what he will say to me, and were we would go from here. Th days seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew, he was knocking on my door. I let him in and he took my by surprise with a big hug. We sepnt hours jsut talking and listening to music. It was as if nothing had ever changed. Before we knew it it was dark out and he was leaving. I walked him to the front of my trailer park, and he sat me down on the side walk and took my hand's. I was shocked and didnt know what to do but listen. He told me that he was sorry for the way he acted and that tonight he realized how much he wanted to be with me, and that he was completely in love with me. I couldnt do anything except cry and laugh at the same time, and soon enough he was laughing with me. I couldnt have asked for a more perfect moment.      It's been six months since @TIME1. We are better than ever becuase we have the laughter. It's what help's keep our relationship solid, and it keep's us close. Everyone need's a little laughter in there life. Im glad that i found someone special enough to always keep me laughing. It's like we never stopped. If you ever feel hopeless and like there's nothing for you. Remember to laugh, it's what makes the world go round."	17	15	32
