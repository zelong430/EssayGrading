4	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail ""@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not posible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you amagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most buissness, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the castomer's convinence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her resturant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 wer not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there."	5	5	10
17	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I belive that computers have a negative effect on peoples lives. I belive this because who spend to much time on the computer don't get out as much as they should, don't spend enough time with their family, and the computer can't do everything. My first reason is I belive that people need to get out more. When they don't get out, they don't exersise and that is very unhealthy. Instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game. I also belive that they should enjoy nature because I feel like they are wasting the beauty of nature all around them. We wouldn't want to waste our abilities and privalges would we? Another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family. If you have family near you, then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another. You can have fun with your family by playing games. You can also have fun by just hanging out, which boost your social skills and the computer can't always do that, which brings me to my next point. The computer can't do everything, so take advantage of what you have now. Some computer time is fine, but it can be very dangerous by getting addictted to it. The computer @MONTH1 have lots of information, but there is nothing that you can't find in a book. Your computer can't love your dog, so there is a reason why we should get off the computer. There are pleanty of other things that you can do that you can't do on the computer, including sports, taking care of family, and any of your hobbys. Remember that the computer @MONTH1 be great from time to time, but it can not live your life for you. That is why I belive that we should spend less time on the computer, and more time getting out, and having fun with family, and that the the computer can't do everything.	4	4	8
46	1	Dear, Local Newspaper @CAPS1 here to inform you that the time we spend on computers is needed because it helps you with information, it helps you to become smarter and it helps you with hand-eye coordination. I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason. My first reason I'll like to state that will convince you with the time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us with information and it teaches stuff about place's, people, culture and more it teaches us useful information which takes a while to learn so the time we spend on computeres is needed to learn new information. My second reason I'll like to state that will convince you with. The time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us to become smarter. Say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it. Computers make you become become smarter. And at the end of the day it's about who's smarter not who does more excerise. My third and final reason which contribute to why we spend the time we spend on computer are needed because it teaches you good hand-eye coordination because it help with typing and become more faster to do essay's and when you have good hand-eye coordination you dont make a lot of mistake's typing. So I have come to my conclusion why a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information, you become smarter, and it teaches good hand-eye coordination this is why a lot of computer time is needed probably even more computer time is needed. A lot of computer time is needed because you get smarter plus it beneifts society.	4	4	8
55	1	ARE YOU @CAPS1!! Computers are great, they're great because of these @NUM1 reasons. Kids can do homework on computers, also you could video chat with friends and family finally because you could look up just about anything you want on the computer. Computers are great because kids can do there homework on the computer, thats good because if they forgot there book in school or something like that then they could just get the answers of the computer. Its also good for business men because they count on computers for all there files. Computer are also great because you can video chat with friends and family. Video chatins is awesome because if a friend or relative goes out of town they could just brings there labtop of webcam and then you can talk to them whenever. Video chatins is also good for company's if there buyer is in a different country they could just video chat all the information.Finally, computers are great because they are so resourceful. There are hundreds of websites where all you have to do is type in what you want to know and there will be thousands of links for you to search and get your answer. They ere also resourceful for pictures or maybe even powerpoint presentation! In conclusion, computers are great because, kids can get there homework done, also its good for video chat finally because the internet is very resourceful.	4	4	8
61	1	Do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer? People are spending too much time on computers. Obesity is a growing problem in today's society, people need to interact with eachother, and we need to get some fresh air. Computer are ruining these things for people. Unplug yourself from your computer. More and more people are becoming obese. This is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. To our whole life, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face. Get out and get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Bring out on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most. Fresh air clear your mind. Time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to releave stress so go outside. Click turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friendsand family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing. People are wasting too much time on their computers and it's flushing our society down the toilet, so just turn off your computer.	4	4	8
69	1	Some people think it is a good idea and same do not. My opinion is that, I think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons. Here are three reasons why, @NUM1. grownups working, @NUM2. students learning how to type, and @NUM3. communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer. For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say. And in person, you can't. Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion. I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, playgames, no sites, and many more other things to go on, only if you have a computer at home.	3	4	7
87	1	"Computers. One of the much enjoyed pieces of technology. But it is also one of the many distractions. Many people ponder if computers are really beneficial. I am one of those thinkers. I think that computers don't always benefit society. They have many, many distractions such as facebook, online games, and even inappropriate images and videos. If you really think of it, are computers as beneficial as we think? My friend, @PERSON2 was just told about facebook, and got a membership. It just started out as a 'na big deal' kind of thing. She went online often, just to check on her status and if she had any messages in her inbox, and that's @CAPS2. But then, she was full-blown addicted. She applied for @CAPS2 the clubs and groups, and she started getting behind in school. She was obtaining a plethora of @CAPS1's on most of her tests after not studying because she was on for almost six hours everyday. @PERSON2 would come home and not even bother to do homework, but would just immediately go online. After one month of being a member, she was failing @CAPS2 of her classes, and her mom took her computer priveleges away. See, she was distracted by one, little thing, and her whole life was almost destroyed. ""But, mom, i'm in the middle of a game! And I'm winning!"" @PERSON1 says vistoriously. @PERSON1 loves online games, and he wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. But, that's not the point. He plays games @CAPS2 the TIME. @PERSON1's game playing gets in the way with the interaction of him and his family. He @CAPS3't played eith his four year old sister, @PERSON3 since she was two years old. his mother also often eats dinner alone. Sometimes, he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping. When he's playing a game, a girl @CAPS4 him, ""@CAPS5 at my pic. They're hot! and he looks at them. He thinks they're harmless but that's not what his mother thinks. his gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life. most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information. But, you can get @CAPS2 kinds of information from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1', you could just @CAPS5 for it in a library. It takes less time, and you won't get carpal tunnel as easily. See? Computers aren't as beneficial as most think. There are @CAPS2 kinds of distraction, and these are only a few."	5	5	10
108	1	"I saw in one of the news papers I got in the mail that had an overnight for people to state their opinion on kids computer useage. I took the idea of waiting this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things. Such as: homework assignments such as essays, sometimes peoples family members go off to was but can't use cell phones, also online job alpications. To start off with, kids have homework assignment right? Most of the time people have to do essays. I ask my mom lots of times if I can do an essay for school, she say, ""why don't you stay after to do it?"" @CAPS1 have lives so they can't stay after, also at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reasons kids use computers alot. Next,, some family members go off to war. Normally for safly and privacy, they wont let the soldiers life their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they to know their ok so they don't have to for two years. So, the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job aplications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commertials show avertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types for people, homebound, elderly, ect. But mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclution, Some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they wont see for along period of time, also school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers when ever they want."	4	4	8
127	1	Computers can affect the way people are and how they interact. Why is there a need to spend your precious life sitting in front of a compute all day?When you can be getting exercise for example going to your local gym. Computers become a distraction to your social life, thats why you should use them for emergency's and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends. Lastly you can enjoy you surrounding and appreciate life and nature. Computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things. Exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit. If your sitting in front of a computer all day your body is going to shut down and won't get the proper exercise. Sports can be just as enjoyable and helps build the human body and gives you the right amount of exercise that your body needs. Sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more. Family is a wonderful thing in life, but they don't live forever. That's why we should cherries every last moment we have with them. A complete citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends. To sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals, for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergency's and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction. Instead of using them we could be getting the right amount of exercise, and spending it with family, and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them. 	4	5	9
160	1	Dear local newspaper, I agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff. For example, they don't spend time exercising, enjoying nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Those are very important things that people don't undeRstand that they are missing of. First, people that spend a lot of time on the computer don't do exercise. Doing exercise is good for your health. If you don't do exercise when you get older your bones are going to work. Also, you could get fat and that is bad for your heart. Just for being on the computer people don't pay attention to their health. Next, people don't enjoy the beautiful nature that is outside. Is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside. People are forgeting about nature. They don't recycle so the planet could be clean. The air that we smell is not clean because they don't care about nature. Instead of being on the computer they chould help so the world could be better. Finally, people don't spend time with the people that love them. Is very important to spend time with your family. People don't realize thats the first thing in life is your family. Instead of being on the computer, is fun going to the beach with your kids, wife, father, and etc. In conclusion, i believe that computers affect on people. People just for being on the computer they don't do exercise, enjoy nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Now that you heard my , i ask you to think about yours.	4	4	8
165	1	Dear Local Newspaper, everday @CAPS1 technology is developed. One of the biggest and most popular machines in the technocle society is, the computer. Some people don't like computers. The think computers are ruining social skills and healthy bodys. The reason I'm writing to you is to presuade those people to realize the greatness that lies inside a computer. For starters computers help us recive/give @CAPS8. One of the great featurs that computers give is email. Without email, we would be completley out of the loop. For example @CAPS2 there is a snowday at your childs school, you recive an email from the usper intendent saying school si cancled. Without that email, we woulden't be able to know that @CAPS8. Another example, @CAPS6 say that you lost your voice to a terrible cold. You don't feel good and need to call work to report being sick. Now you're stuck because you have no voice. @CAPS2 you had a computer, you could have simply emailed your boss. Another posative tool computers gives us is making communicating esayer. With all of the social networking now avalible like @CAPS4, twitter , @CAPS3 and yahoo messanger. It nearly impossible not to stay in contact with friends and faimly using @CAPS4, you can look up old friends and faimly. Once youve found them, you can friend request them and become online friends. Once youre online friends you can instant message, video chat, look at their status, and browse their photos. So with a computer @CAPS7 nearly impossible not to be able to keep in touch. The last and final reason computers are great is because, they make shopping much esayer. @CAPS2 you have used amazon, ebay or overstock, you know what I'm talking about you can buy almost anything online. From electronics to @CAPS5 animals. The list is endless. With a computer you can even get your house hold groceries online. For example @CAPS6 say your home from work with explosive diharrea. But @CAPS7 @DATE1 so you need to go grociery shopping. You've been on the toilet @PERCENT1 of the day and alls youve got is your laptop. Well you can shop online. So as you can see computers help us communicate, shop and get and recive @CAPS8.	4	5	9
168	1	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1 you really think computers are that good? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great.	5	4	9
173	1	Dear, Newspaper I would like to tell you about computers, without them this world would fall apart. For example, some peoples jobs are to fix them, make then, sell them, also some people work from home and need the computer for their jobs. Without them soo many people would @CAPS1 out of jobs and geting paidless. Also, kids need them for education reasons, for example, if you had a broken finger and couldent hold a pencil you would have to type. In addition, what if a student needed an answer to a question and there has no to help them they could go online and get the answer and learn. Theres many ways a computer run help a person. For example, they could need directions or some ones phone number or answers. Also, you can buy off line what if you live too far away from your favorite stare you can fast or der it off line. Also I believe kids should get off the computer any go out side and exercise, to day there is to many over weight people if people what for a walk instead of siting on the computer all day there woulden @CAPS1 as many over weighted people. In addition, people need exercise without it people would get faty, lazy, sleepy, and some sick, and angery, deppression. it would @CAPS1 to every ones benifit if people would exercise more. In addition without computers alot or peoples lives would fall apart, people just need to exercise more and everyting will @CAPS1 fine.	4	4	8
176	1	Computers and the @CAPS1 were a technological break through. It exposed to the average world, things that were never thought possitive. But as these things advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so bad of an addiction its begun to threaten peoples lives I've been given a choice to s'de with the addicting computers, or to offose them. The only clear choice is to offose. First off, computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise. Studies show @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who use a computer, do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world, nations are becoming more over weight. This is a huge problem in the united states computers are main cause to why the @CAPS2.S is over weight and unhealthy by cutting down computers use, we can get our world back into great shape we can bring exercise and health back. Nextly, I'm sure you've all heard of online predators. It's scary just to think about, well as computer technology increased online predators numbers went up. I remember a couple of years ago, I was watching the news and a story came a normal teenage girl, being killed by someone she meton myspace. things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen are in creasing. by putting people on computers you're putting then at risk of death this is an extreme problem computers have caused. Thus is the last efferct computers have, out of many that I'm going to state time on the computer, is time taken away from family and friends.This can ruin relationship in and outside the family. Now I'm sure you now many people have become extremely addicted to online games. the more they play these games the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved computers are a leading cause in disfunctional families. they steal the user away from the outside word. these people need to get their families and friends back. You have to act now, before its too late and computers have over taken the world. If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction, do what you can to help get them back we need to cutt back on any kind of computer use fast. Hurry, it's now or never.	5	5	10
181	1	"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are machines that have been around for @MONTH1 years. With internet, you can do things like play games, research information, and even talk to friends and family, all through a computer. Advances in computer technology are beneficial to @CAPS1 society for several reasons. These includes that computers improve hand-eye coordination, provide abundant information, and allow people to talk online. As said earlier, using a computer can improve hand-eye coordination. In fact, it is known that computers can immensely improve your reflexes. This reminds me of a time when my brother went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing. Patrick, my brother, was then literally assigned by the doctor to play computer games to help his hand-eye coordination. As a matter of fact, @PERCENT1 agree that computers can have a gargantuah, positive impact on reflexes and hand-eye coordination. If computers heldful in this way and, in some cases, necessary for your eyes, then why would the use of computers be classified as bad when they are clearly a beneficial factor in @CAPS1 society? Computers are also beneficial because of what huge resource they are. the internet offers so much information for people of all ages who want to learn and thrive. For example, most schools have their students use computers for research. When I say most schoold, I mean @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to research using a computer. Principal of new city @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS1 students use computers at leat every week if not more. They are fantastic resource with endless information."" Computers are getway to countless amounts of knowledge that everyone should have access to. It is well known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away. I, myself, have friend who lives in @LOCATION1 that I miss very much. When long-distance phone calls are too expensive most of the world and I rely on computers to talk to out far-away friends. Computers are the bridge between @CAPS2; (my @CAPS3 friend) and I. However, computers are not only used long distance. I also use computers to e-mail, instant message, video chat, and just stay connected to family and friends. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, says. ""I use my computer to stay connected with friends and my family that lives in another county. I don't know what I would do without it."" This means that @PERSON1 and thousands of others rely on computers for communication with friends and Family. Computers are necessary for @MONTH1 reasons. They help people, educate, and connect people. You must have access to a computer in my opinion, in order to thrive in life."	5	5	10
218	1	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 want your kids & citizens to get fat and lazy? Or be active, learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you? @PERCENT1 of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well I think after reading this those extra @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn @CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could got their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club. This can work to people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. Their are great things to @CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big faster in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up tell them to use dictionary, theasaurus or a book. If people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs. Bt @CAPS1 help find carrer options and life. sitting on front of a screen can your health and also. Their are better things to @CAPS1. Instead via internet. You can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends. If your a boy you could just go @CAPS1 like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since geting p and side could help you socialize and learn and even loose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity.	4	4	8
247	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are now using computers. However, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about them. Some people don't like them, and then there's people like me who do like them. Computers can let you communicate faster, you can play all sorts of games for @CAPS3, and it provides information. Nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them. Unlike sending and writing letters to people, instant messaging is a much faster and easier way to talk to another person. Sending and receiving letters can take days or weeks, on the other hand, instant messaging takes only a few seconds! Even better, it's @CAPS3! Instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family, there is also video chat. Video chat is just like talking on the phone but you can also see the person you're talking to. You can be talking on video chat with someone from another country, and guess what? It's also @CAPS3! When you make long distant calls, it can be very costly, but video chat won't cost a penny out of your pockets! Not only is a computer good for communication, but you can also play fun and entertaining games! Everyone enjoys playing games, whether you're one or eighty-two. There are @CAPS2 websites on the internet and among them there are game sites. Most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for @CAPS3! There's one player, two player, and party . This means you could play alone, with a friend, or the whole family. Everyone on in and have a time. Also, computers could be for fun and your used for work. The @CAPS2 information. It's like your own personal library at home at a touch of a finger! Either you're doing research on a project, , or just want to be informed, the internet can help you with any subject. All you have to do is search the topic you need whether it's cooking a certain dish, learning about space, trying to spell a word, or anything you can think of, and it'll all be there for you, and once again, for @CAPS3! In conclusion, computers are useful for @CAPS2 things and these are just a few examples. I hope you think of computers the way I, and millions of other people, do. As you can see, computers impoved the lives of @CAPS2 human beings.	4	4	8
263	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 minute of the day - millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops, but is it always a good thing? The question has been raised if people spending alot of time on computers is a bad thing. Computers are a bad thing because people spend too much time on them and lose quility time with friends and family. The dangers of online interaction, and the risk of having your information stolen. Countless people around the world face these problems everyday and computer usage should be lessened. Whether teens, kids, or adults are gaming, on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers. For example, of the @PERCENT1 of people who have computers with online access @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours a day on them. This is about @NUM2 billion hours of computer usage around the world. Children and adults alike have lost face time or interraction with other human beings face to face. Before computers kids played outside running and playing around. While in present day less than @PERCENT3 of all children get at least one hour of time outside. Computers are not a bad thing, but its is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health. These facts have not just contributed, but they are almost the cause of obesity in the world. Computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems. The additon of online chat to computers has not only increased computer usage but doubled it. The invention of @CAPS2, and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing, but it sure did turn into one. Online chat allows people to send hatefull and vulgar messages to their enemys without showing their face. In some cases some teens were harrased online so bad they committed suicide. Another bad thing about @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 is that dangerous criminals can hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place where they can be kidnapped. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 users of online chat was lured by a criminal to a "" meeting place"" and was kidnapped and never seen against last year. Most of these victims do not return or are found. Although the invention of chat online was meant as quick easy communication it became a horror crime in most cases. Millions even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers. These hackers break the security codes and buy things online using other peoples money. Four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and @NUM5 out of those four people have had at least one account hacked. This problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites. If this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt. These hackers know who you are, your family, your personal information, and where you live. Internet usage needs to be cut down to sites. If we do not then usage will increase, there will be no chat problems and peoples money will get stolen."	5	5	10
275	1	Dear @PERSON1, Advances in technology and computers is a bad thing. When the computer company's such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1, make cool updates to their computer systems people do not want to shut their computer off, which is not a good thing. As a child did you spend all of your time indoors and online? Computers take time away from spending time outside, or exercising. And they affect very crucial family time. Computer advances are bad for our country and town. Now-a -days, kids would much rather spend time on their computers than outside. This can have a very negative affect. First of all, it is important that students see and feel nature, and last time I checked they can not do that on a computer. Children need to see animals, smell the sweet scent of flowers and feel the breeze brush against their cheeks. A second reason that going outside is important is for the sun. Even though the sun does have harmful days, it is still important for health that everyone spends some time in the sun. The computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous. Computer also take precious time away from exercise. If people spend all their time on computers, then do they exercise. Everyone is supposed to get at least @NUM1 minutes of activity daily, but no one ever spends that much time working out. Also, obesity numbers have increased greatly since the invention of personal computer and the internet. Obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to disease. Life with computers has lead to less people exercising and obesity rates increasing. Another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families. Family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family. Plus with encouregement from their family, many students excel in school and sports, which gives them graet self-confidence. Computers take time away from something that should be thw most important to everyone, family. Many people are affected negatively by computers. The technology takes very important time away from children and adults. It takes time away from the outdoors, exercising, and family. Yes, computers @MONTH1 make life easier, but they have a much more negative affect than they do a positive one.	6	5	11
276	1	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from school and go on aim. So they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obiese. I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun. Also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together. The kids will see more nature and be bale to learn more about animals. When kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing. ALso some kids post pictures of themselves on things like facebook that are not appropriate and cna get them in lots of trouble. They also say things that they wouldn't normally say to a persons face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble. Whne your outside palying baseball, football or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and your having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obies. Some say the computer is good hand eye coordination but catching a football or hitting is bettre. Also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends is better than talking in your friends or video chatting with them, @CAPS2 are to many over weight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not heloing the cause. 	4	4	8
291	1	Have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us? Now, we can learn about anything we want, talk with people on the other side of the world, and even advance in other areas of technology. Computers have, without a doubt, had a positive effect on people. Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, the next in a losh, steamy, jungle thriving with animals...All without leaving your room! Using computers, people can learn about new places and things whenever they want. The millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about t other places and times. Although this information @MONTH1 be in a local library. Going on the computer is MUCH easier. Who want to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library, when the internet is there for your use any time? No registration to get a library card. No late fees and no waiting lists. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. @NUM1 out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message, or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive but with email, I can talk to my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. With e-mail and instant messaging, it was easy to talk, and exchange the latest news! Having the ability to communicate with soemone easily is an unbeliveable privalige, that would be none existant without computers to help us. Lastly, computers have helped people make advances in othe areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have helped scientists to do experiments. With a simulated expiriment they can be positive that no other variables will affect your results. Now, experiments can be extremely acurate. Computers have helped advance medicine as well. They have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases. Who knows, maybe in @NUM2 years therew ill be a cure for cancer. All of these amazing accomplishments have been positivly effected by computers. ALthough some people @MONTH1 think that computers have a negative impact on our day-to-day life, I @PERCENT1 disagree. People have learning, talking, and advances in technology with one click of a mouse. Computers have effected people positivley in many ways, so, click away! Computers have none of that.	5	6	11
299	1	Do you think computers have a negative effect on people? Well I don't I think @CAPS2 is on easier way to get information faster. The three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people are to learn about faraway places, to have jobs in the computer, business, and you are able to talk to people from faraway. These are many other reasons but I'@CAPS1 only required to talk about three. First of all, you are able to learn about faraway places you can learn about places you aren't able to see in real life. @CAPS2 is a faster way to get information about news that wouldn't be able to out on newspaper until the next day. If you dont have money to travel then you could just go on the internet and see the faraway places in many ways, @CAPS2's just a better source of information. My second reason is to have a job in the computer business. There are alot of jobs that require computers. If we didn't have computers more and more people would not have jobs. Also, business would be slow because they wouldn't have the information they needed. That is why computers are needed. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, yes people are able to talk through the phone but its not the some if you get to talk and see the person. Video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends. You can talk to relatives, friends, or anyone you want to talk to. If we didn't have computers you would lose touch with people you know that live faraway from you. That would be a terrible thing. In conclusion computers are an easier way to get information. You can learn about faraway places. You can have a job in the computer business. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, I think computers are a positive thing.	4	4	8
309	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 all the talk about computers these days I would have to agree with the people who think its taking up alot more of our time. I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family. Why do you think the obesity is so high these days? Well theres one of the reasons and I @CAPS5 when my parents were kids that they had no computers and they went outside to enjoy nature. Computers have there ups and downs but I do not think they benifit out society, first reason being, computers are taking away time to be with our friends and family. I rember when facebook and @CAPS6 werent created those were the days when people actually did fun things with there friends and family. there was a recent study that snowed since @DATE1 to @PERCENT1 of all americans use computers more than @NUM1 @CAPS2 a day for all sorts of diffrent reasons. I think mainiy computers were invented to make reason easier but now adays all we use them for is social networking. My second biggest point as to why computers do not benifit our is because over the past @NUM2 years the obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT3 and due to what cause? eating un healthy food and sitting in front of your computers all day not exersiing. I am almost @PERCENT2 sure that if people stoped using computers that our world would be a healthier place. dont you feel bad for those people who are stuck being ovwrsized for there whole life because of these habits? I @CAPS5 most people would feel bad. My last reason is that we have this ahmazing planet that no one seems to enjoy anymore becaus they use up all there time on computers if only people got out every once and a while they would relize they have been wasting where time. there been a recent study that says @PERCENT4 of people are inside doing nothing all day! thats more than half!! I hope this will change somtim soon because computers hace only created a nusence to people and now it seems like no one has any type of a life.. computers hace spread to all sorts ofs societys but please let it not take over this friendly town of @CAPS1.	4	5	9
342	1	"Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that that benefits society. As editor of the newspaper, you have the power to inform people about situations. In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following: the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, they allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, that has @NUM1 little girls. Every day in the morning before school @PERSON1 checks on the weather, on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school. However, one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Little did he know the roads were extremely icey. Sadly @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones. As you can see, the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room. Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states says that, ""chating online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp and many other places."" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school. Also @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. I believe that chating online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades. Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time. However teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing. Finally most jobs today use computers. For example my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also the chat can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer revolutionise the jobs of people. In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society. Please take my idea into consideration."	5	4	9
357	1	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways. Some can be terrible, and others not so bad. Many average people are now staying inside all day on the computer playing games, or on facebook and other interactive websites such as twitter and @CAPS1. This crisis is interfering with school, work, or excersize. More and more people each day are not getting enough exercize or work done. We have to stop this devastating pandemic! People who are staying inside all day arn't as healthy as they were before. There immune system making the risk of getting sick greater. This can cause people in severe positions or even death. @CAPS4 you stay inside all day every day, the computer will be so addicting it will take over you and make it more important. In order to maintain healthy you have to eat right and good in riding a bike. @CAPS2 someone is inside on the computer frequently, they arn't @CAPS2 you're addicted to something like watching t.v. or playing @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you are addicted to the it can also interfere with family events, sports. @CAPS2 youre on the computer you forget about homework, grades drastically making you go to summer school, or even repeating a grade. Also @CAPS2 you don't prepare for sports it can make you not play up to your potential. This is why computers are affecting every day people. There are more reasons how people are being affected by computers, but these are the most common.	4	4	8
377	1	Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine life without your computer? No? Well that's what I am trying to change. Millions of @CAPS2 spend countless hours with their eyes glued to '@ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3 monitor screens. Spending that much time sitting in one space isn't healthy, not only do people not get enough exercise but they don't get the chance to apperiate the natural world around them that is ever changing. Teens and even small children get lost in cyberworld and don't use their after school time wisely to study or do homework. The internet is also a dangerous place and the growing computer use with maximize the problem. To begin, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is growing rapidly, a recent study done by the @LOCATION2. goverment shows that @NUM1 people are over weight and @NUM2 people are on the of obesity. We @CAPS4 could decrease the obesity rate and be healthier and happier by exersicing and getting out more. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight. Secondly, the more time you spend cooped up inside the less time you get to enjoy nature. The natural world is ever changing, and you will miss out on a lot of amazing opportunities if you hardly ever step foot outside your front door. Execive comouter use will wear them out quicker than normal, where does your old word out computer go when you get the @ORGANIZATION2? A landfill! The more your use your computer the faster you will trash it. If every @CAPS5 threwout one computer a year their would be over @NUM3 million discarded dells, gateways, macs, we would be living in trash. @CAPS1 exesive computer use ruins the environment, and hurts your health! What are you waiting for? Go run outside! Ride a bike! Give your computer a break. Finally, the growing computer use increases the amount of internet predetors, and the odds that you or your child could be tougeled skyrocket. With more and more kids on the computer each okey the, internet saftey level drops. Not only could these children be watching inappopriate videos on youtube or cyber bulling on @CAPS6, they could be giving personal information out to people they don't even know without realizing it on myspace and facebook, @PERCENT1 of kiddnappings are possible because of information found on the computer. Do you want any thing like that ever to happen to you or your family? I didn't think so. Get up off of your comfy computer chairs and take a walk. Limit your internet and computer use, all it does is hurt you, theres no gain. Thank you for reading and don't support rapid advances in computer technology.	5	5	10
384	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers have a possitive effect on people? I know I @CAPS2. Computers are good for many reasons: @NUM1 reason is because people can learn about far away places; @NUM2 they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @NUM3 they can teach hand eye coordination. First off if you're taking you want to learn about where you are going. Computers can help with that! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you. You can @CAPS2 many things while talking to freinds on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderfull things. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurece bill. If you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. So thats why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver.	4	4	8
404	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have on people as posotive I say that it is posotive because what if your in a rush, and you don't know if you need your rain boots or not? Check the computer! I say that it is posotive because without the computer how would most offices run their buisness? It's too much of a pain to keep everything on files. Especially in schools because the teachers don't keep their grades for students in a filing cabinet! They keep them on the computer, @CAPS1 they'd need a huge filing cabinet. I could understand why some peole think computers have a bad effect on people. They might think that it takes away time from nature, friends and family. But so many people take their laptops to the local park to sit under a tree on warm days and go on the computer there. Especially students do this, they do their homework under the leaves to help them relax. Also, people whose family or friends live in other states, they @MONTH1 not have the house number, or they don't have time for a long conversation, they can e-mail them, or use social networking like facebook, or myspace to look on their profile pages and say a quck, ""@CAPS2, how are you doing?"" Local shop owner @PERSON1 says, ""I barely have time for myself! So when I want to say @CAPS2 to my sister in @LOCATION1, I usually say hello on facebook because I know how she loves to talk my ear off!"" I remember one morning, when I was rushing before school, I had no idea what type of outfit to wear. I checked the local news casting website for the weather forecast and thank god I did! I would have gotten stock in downpour without an umbrella! Computers are also good for if you want to catch up on any news, or just relax and play some games you can. So, if your wondering about the weather to see if today will be a good day to sit under the trees in the park & catch up on typing that report with your partner, then go ahead. But don't forget to e-mail her and ask her first, since you lost her phone number."	4	4	8
409	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable.	4	4	8
429	1	@ORGANIZATION1, Computers are great tools and a great piece of modern technology. Almost every family has them. About @PERCENT1 of my class has computers. So many people have them because their helpful and another current learning resource. Also it's a great way to keep in touch with friends. Although they can be time consuming they make up for it in the long run. First, they are helpful because it's quick an easy to get from page to page. It's especially helpful for work because instead of calling a bunch of clients. You can send them all emails in under a few minutes. They also help with school or planning a vacation. You can find great low prices on travel agencies on the computer. This is great because our country is having a bad acession and we need to be saving every penny. These are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful. Next is that it's a great current learning resource. You can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple days before. Sometimes the articles in books are old and. Those out dated articles don't have accurate more researched information But, computers do so you can compare your information. Also there are online schoold that are affordable. So if you want to get more of an education but, you have to work too. This helps a great deal. A computer can be used for many things like learning. Computers are definetly the best way to keep in touch with friends and family that you aren't able to see very often. I know what your probably thinking, is that well isn't that what phones are for. No because what if that family member or friend doesn't have a phone. Well then they can use their computer to stay in touch. They can use email, facebook, aim, and so many more. A computer helps me stay in touch with people I haven't seen in awhile. Okay, now that I've stated all my reasons why computers are a great resource. I just want to remind you that their helpful a great learning resource, and a great way to stay in touch. Computers are now an important piece of Society. Computers are a whole new track and it should stay that way.	5	4	9
441	1	Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become a major part of peoples lives. The effects computers have on people are only negative. Nothinggood comes out of using a computer. This is because computers are time consuming from in other activities, computers are not always working which leads to people getting angry, and using computers is bad for your health. I know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what I have to say, their will be no doubt that you will agree. Using computers is very time consuming. People don't realize how long they have been using the computer. Once you start using it, your hooked and it's hard to stop. A poll was taken and out of @NUM1 kids, @NUM2 of them said they felt groggy and had headaches, after using a computer for two hours. The way computers make you feel is not enjoyable. But while your using the computer it's entertaining, for example, your on @CAPS1 and your talking to your friend and your laughing at them & enjoying yourself, but it's not the computer that's making you happy, it's the person, you might as well see them in person. There for, computers are time consuming & should not be used. Copmputers are not reliable, they have minds of their own. Many people do always rely on their computer and when it doesn't work it causes the person to get angry or frustated. Computers have a vast impact on people, but they shouldn't have to. Dr. @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2's frustration & anger is caused by non-working computers. If the use of computers was lowered anger that people have would lower and would lead to other positive things as well. Furthermore, computers are not realiable and cause people to get angry. My final reason is that, computers cause health issues and cause people to be lazy. The obesity rate is higher than ever and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping. @PERCENT2 of obesity is caused by the use of computers. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION2 says that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people who don't use computers are much healthier because instead of using computers they exercise. There for, computers cause health issues. In conclusion, computers effect people because they are time consuming, you can't rely on then and it's bad for your health. There for, computers have negative effects on people. 	4	4	8
467	1	Dear @CAPS1, Computers have many posative affects on society these days. I believe this because computers provide us with communication skills. They provide you with information and they increase your skill when it comes to technology. Read on to hear how i further explain my reasoning. First off, computers provide you with communication skills. I know that i am always finding the computer useful. It allows you access to websites that help you talk to new and dd friends. It is a fast and easy way to communicate with someone. Whether your at your house, or on the go with your laptop, you can talk to people all over the world. Secondly, computers supply you with information to write papers, newspaper articles, etc. When a teacher asks the class to with a paper about a specific topic, students can simply just go home on or type the topic in on a search . At that point they're automaticly supplied with thousands and thousands of different sources of information. I know that @PERCENT1 of the population of the @LOCATION1, prefer computer sources over book sources because computers are so much easier when it comes to finding specific information. Lastly, computers increase your skills when it comes to technology. Although some computers @MONTH1 be fairly easy to use companies are constantly trying to increase the difficulty of computers. They ar also always coming out with new software for your computer. By making computers and softwares more high tech, people the generation now is more technicly advanced than many other countries. As a whole computers have a huge impart on our countries technical skills. I believe computers have a posative affect on society. I think this because computers provide us with communication skills, they provide you with information, and they increase your skill whenit comes to technology. I hope i have made it so that we are looking at this from the same angle.	4	4	8
471	1	I believe that computers benefit society. They make life easier. Computers allow now of communication between friends. They also teach you new things. Computers make our lives easier. They let us look things up by easier means than a person or book. It has made it simpler to type reports. Now you don't have to worry about making mistakes on a typewriters and having to type it again. A computer saves the report and shows you some mistakes to take case of your children. It allows you to from your home. Computers allow new means of communication. You can talk online with friends. Social networks such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 allow that. Computers allow you to converse with friends you don't normally get to see or talk to. They also make it easier and more fun to make new friends. Computers teach us new things. They teach you about places you haven't seen before. Any question you can be asked on the internet and you will get an answer. It gives you answer you don't know who to ask for. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. You can play games online or with @CAPS3's. You need to have good hand-eye coordination in order to play these games. Computers have a positive effect on people of all ages. They make our lives easier with their technology. They allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks. Computers also teach us new things such as hand-eye coordination. All these reasons and more are why I believe that computers benefit our society.	4	4	8
473	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 i think it it good and bad. The good is it teaches people about @CAPS1 places and how other people live in there soicty what they do to get food or how they raise there kids. It also help people like cops. Because the have a person there looking for they have the computer to look on. It also help cops as in a speeder they can see it her or she have done it befor. It helps teaches to get a lesson or line to teach or they will put you on line to help you with your typeing. Yes it dose have a positive effect on some people. So people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do there best work online. Like say a high school paper. Yes you can talk to other people online get @CAPS1 friends. On the other hand computers can be bad as in you meet people online you don't know who that person is or where they come from. They might have a long crimal. They might be some on want to get you in troble because of his or her family problems. Some people spend to much time on the computer because they meet some one they rally like and don't worry about what the family want to do. So people use to work out every day but now they can talk to they friend all night and all day they stop and forget about it and never start agine. Some people just stay in the and stay on the computer got playing baceball or football or going to family reunions.	3	4	7
485	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers have a negative affect on people. Computers have caused problems where kids do not do any types of physical activity which deprives them of their daily needed exercise. Also, children spend so much time on the computer, they don't get a chance to enjoy the outdoors. Another effect computers have on kids is that @CAPS6 stops them from spending time with family and friends. I don't know how people can sit on a computer all day without moving around. First, kids don't get enough exercise because the spend too much time on a computer. We know almost everybody has a computer even I do, but @CAPS6 doesn't mean @CAPS6 has to be used @NUM1. I am a athlete and I enjoy being on the computer, but I don't use @CAPS6 every second I can. Doctors always reccomend everyone to get a least an hour of exercise everyday. Most people don't do that. They would be the kind of people who uses the computer or a different electronic a lot. That is also causing childhood obesity. If all you do is sit on the computer all day, your going to be someday. But people need to get off the computer and do something like a sport or even a game like. If you don't exercise you wont enjoy the outdoors. Second, people are not enjoying the outdoor. If somebody likes to play sports they shouldn't don't on @CAPS4 for three hours instead they invite a couple of friends to lay same basketball. Even walking home from school with a friend is a good way to be outside. People @MONTH1 think during the winter there is nothing to do. Have a snowhall fight with some friends and enjoy your selves. Nobody should feel embarrassed even if you wanted to play tag with a friend but you're @NUM2. Just get outside and do something. There are millions of things to do that isn't going on a computer. You're a kid so long that you have to enjoy your selves now before your serious with you life. Lastly when you're not outside you're not enjoying yourself with your friends or family. People are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family. You're not hanging out with you friend if you are chatting on @CAPS4. Is @CAPS6 so hard to tell them online ""@CAPS5 @NUM3 come @NUM3 my house."" @CAPS6 takes two seconds. Then in no time you will be hanging out with your friend. I don't understand why is @CAPS6 some embarrassing to be with your family. Mydad and I like to go and play basketball or ping pong with each other. We don't care becaue we have fun. Find something your parents like to do and see if you like @CAPS6. @CAPS6 isn't hard to say to a friend or parent, ""@CAPS5 to do something."	5	5	10
489	1	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 I can see both sides of your argument, on wether computers are important. However, computers have revelotivizied they way we live our lives. Just for a moment, think what would the world be like without computers. I feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives. Computers are espicially important to students and teachers. For instance if a student needed to do a report on @LOCATION1, he could look up facts and other things on @LOCATION1, then he could condence the facts into a paragraph on a word document, and if he had a question he could email his teachers. Finaly he, could print out the finished report. All that, without having to get up and bother his parrents to go to the bookstore and pay @NUM1 on a book that he will probably read one time. Also if he had a question there would be no comunication outside of school. Anothe example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spares them of logging heavy texbooks home. Because I know computers have helped me in school and more work much easier. Secondly, @PERCENT1 of busnesses say that they use computer daily, and some agree that without computer, their busnesses would fail. Computer make busnes much easier, espically with the busness monoging and file keeping programs that are oidible. On a computer, busnesses can store customer information, comppare income, and keep stock of inventary without having a cluttered pile or file cobinet. Computers can also saave buseness money because that con cut out jobs such as record keeper. Also busnesses con save time of having meeting via web cams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting then do it next monet and the month after; and they coud emall impertant things such as sales projections and other things as well. Computers are also important and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from the home they can order pizza online and they can go shopping online. Also, people can pay their bills online which saves paper. Lets say this, a moter, has a child! who is sick and she wants to know the to heal him, what to feel him, and what medicine to give hime. She can look all this up on the computer and bookmail the websites for next time. Then her other child comes provide, and she wants to find a health snork. She can feed him which she ca do online. Next she ways to make chicken fried rice,out she wnet know how, she can look up the recipe online. Finaly after dinner she need to cleen a stain on the carpet but it wont come out so she buys a carpet cleener from the web. Computers have just moderthy mothers day so much easier. Without computers our lives would be much harder. If we didnt have computers if the person who a report on @LOCATION1 would have failed, the sick child would have not, the hungry child would have been fed unhealthy food, and @MONTH1 would fail. coputers are an important afect of our lives.	4	5	9
496	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you like it if your children stay on the computer all the time? I wouldn't children or even adults won't spend time with family, kids will be unhealthy, and lastly they can get addicted to using the computer and computer language. Please keep reading to hear my ideas. To begin with, children or even adults won't spend as much time with their family. For example @PERCENT2 of people will stay on the computer all day and won't even worry about their kids. i remember when I read on facebook that the guy was so into a game he was playing that he didn't answer the phone when they tould him his son got hit by a car. Now, news lpaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you wan't your son going through what that man's son went through? I don't think so. Also, kids or adults will be unhealthy and not exercise. A study was shown and @PERCENT3 of people who use the internet don't exercise or work out. out of that @PERCENT3, @PERCENT4 are suffering from obeasity. my cousin is always on the computer and the doctor tould him to minimize how muchtime your on it because hes obeast. He weighs @NUM1 pounds due to being on the computer all the time. So tell me, newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you want your kids to be abease. Lastly, now-a-days kids are ""obsessed"" with the computer an computer. @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer use the computer language in school. And out of that @PERCENT1 put internet on their phone so they can go on myspace, facebook, ect. Now, newpaper @CAPS1, what @CAPS2 happen if you wrote computer language in your article woudn't you get fired? In conclusion, i hope you took my letter into concideration. kids or adults will be unhealthy, kiods will be too obsessed with the computer and lastly they won't spendtime with family."	4	5	9
505	1	"Do you have a computer? I'll bet @PERCENT2 of you do! You @MONTH1 spend @NUM1 hours on the computer or even @NUM2 hours! Computers in fact have many down-sides to them. You could be so invoilved that you never go outside or get excirsize. Also, sitting @NUM2 inchs from the computer screen does not help your eyes. Lastly, the internet has very inapropriot websites that kids should not be seeing. Are you a kid who spends @NUM4 to @NUM2 hours at a time on the computer? Well, if you are, it's time to get off the spinning computer chair and out for soem fresh air. Most kids spend most of their time on the computer @CAPS1 or on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. It @MONTH1 be good for kids to interact with kids out of school but sooem kids take it way to far. They never go oitside and get any excirsize. this is not good for a growing teen. They need to be up and active. So, limit yourself time you spend on the computer. Without a doubt, computers are very bad fro youe eyesight. Unlike @CAPS4 or video games you could play a long distance away, a computer is played @NUM2-7 inches from the over time, your eyes will be so use to sitting @NUM2 inches from what your recating, that when you back up you  erad at all. I knew this who played video games from about @NUM8 foot away for long period of time a day. Today, unfortunately, the kid is blind if that kid just knew the consequences of being that close to a @CAPS4 screen, he would have thought twice about it. Think twice about how close you sit from the computer. if I were to ask anyone of you what you could find on the internet @PERCENT1 of you would say, ""anything."" could there really be too much information? As a matter of fact, tehre is. You could be looking up a topic and something inapropriot, that has nothing to do with the topic comes up kids doin't need to, and shouldn't be watching or seeing these inapropriot sites. Its bad for kids, so stop it! After reading this essay, I hope you realized that computers are bad for you in various ways. As a matter of fact it's physically, mentally and socially. So, next time your on a computer, don't look at the little things, but the big picture!"	5	5	10
507	1	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think that manypeople are not benefiting fromusing computers. There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer. By using the computer, people are getting less exercise, not enjoying the nature, and not interacting with family or friends. By using the computer, people are not getting many benefits. As i mentioned, people who use computers too much are getting less exercise. By not exercising, this could really affect people's health. From recent studies by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people whouse computers too much are overweight. That is an extremly high statistic! By computers affecting this many people's lives is ridiculous. This many people really shouldn't be over weight. If these people aren't getting exercise they could become addicted to the computer. If peopole are getting addicted to the computer they @MONTH1 start to do bad things with the computer. They could publish bad things go on ridiculous websites, and watch horrible things. The worst is probably watching bad things. It really puts a bad influence on everyone. Lastly, if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes. If you are staring at the computer all day, your eyes @MONTH1 not be used to seeing everything else. It's hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next. Clearly, being on the computer is bad for health. Not enjoying nature is also something that people aren't benefiting from. As you @MONTH1 know, getting freshair is good for everyone. Its always nice to smell the nice @DATE1 air after being in school all day. Many people dont do this because as soon as they get home its to the computer. These people are losi a lot of refreshment. I recently interviewed @PERSON1 she told me that, ""many people don't get to see what's on in the world because of computers."" They never take that to look at anything thats going on around them. By keeping updated. You never know what topic @MONTH1 pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature. Lastly, there are always animals that need help. Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home i have and by helping these animals you're saving life. Many people dont have this opportunity because they are on the computer. Obviously, there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature. My last reason is hat by being on the computer you're not interacting with family or friends. In some cases, the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent. If you're a parent you need to help your family with everyday chores. I know, they can be innoying to have to do but you're helping your family and thats all you can do. Also, if you are a parent that has children they always need help. Some kids are younger and don't know how to find information for a project. But, that's why a parent is there. But, if the parent is on the computer they aren't able to fulfill this requirement. I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger. Lastly, family parties and computers do not mix. From past experience, when family has come over my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say ""hello"" to anyone. I find this extremly rude. I just hope that family members don't get offened by this. Clearly, using the computers takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should have limited time on computers. By using computers people don't have enough exercise, aren't enjoying nature, and spend less time with family. Thank you for reading my opinion."	6	4	10
520	1	Dear newspaper, I think computers are good for you because talk online, teach hand eye coordination, and other stuff too. One reason @CAPS9 he helps you with your hand eye coordination for example teach you how you look while typing. @CAPS3 we dont learn hand eye coordination we won't know how to do other stuff that @CAPS9 hand eye coordination. The second reason @CAPS9 @CAPS1 you have a webcam you can use @CAPS1 for example when a family member @CAPS9 living in a different state you can see their face and talk to them like you do in person. The last reason @CAPS9 searching the web because @CAPS3 you want to get @CAPS4 ticits for a trip look online. @CAPS1's the best way to get them. researcher say @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say getting online @CAPS9 the best way because you can see when the @CAPS4 take off, when the next @CAPS4 also when to come back home. All in all I say that compuetrs are a good thing because they help with you hand eye coordination also. @CAPS3 you have a web cam you can see family members from different states and see the face and talk to them like you are talking In person. The last thing @CAPS9 searching the web for @CAPS4 tickets @CAPS3 you want to go somewhere far a way go online and see when the @CAPS4 and comes back because researchers says that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 People say that getting online for @CAPS4 ticket @CAPS9 the best way to get them. Ask your self woild you like to have the web to seach or not?	3	3	6
541	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing now adays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that it is hurting our society. This isn't right because you need it for education, people aren't on all day, and a job. So how could those things be harmful to society. Your right they can't. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have an education with out a computer. If you rae working and you need to get another degree for your job. You can't go during the day so you can find a school that has online schooling, for at night. That way you don't miss work and you still get your schooling. Another reason why is that a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project. Or cite your sorces. What if you need to type an essay what do you do then. No computers no education and you will go and works at @CAPS1 or something. Where you don't need an education. But people aren't on all day so what does that do to society. Nothing at all. Kids and adults go outside and have fun. They go on the computer to check e-mails, play games, look at facebooks/myspaces. But they have enough responcibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit in side then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way. Not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for thier self and don't need others, to do it for them. So it really shouldn't effect you at all. What if at you job you need the internet. Most office people have a computer to talk to others by e-mail or to fix problems. People who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money. People that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record. The video games are a perfect example because the programers use a computer to porgram what you want to happening the game and thet takes hours to complete. So how are computers harmful to society because I still don't see it. Education, people aren't on all day and a job are really good reason that computers should becept. So everyone I strongly encourage you to reconsider what could happen without computers.	4	4	8
543	1	"@CITY1 @CAPS1: I believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. They allow you to see places. If you have a long distance relationship you can talk to them and they have many good excessories. What if you were looking for a new home? You could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location. Then finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price. Computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather for that time. If you are going somewhere for, you can use the computer to find a plane. Computers are helpful when it comes to places! The excessories on the computer are endless. One big excessory that people like to do is games. Games are great to get your mind going. Practically all of the grades require hand-eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. You need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out! If you are bored, games are very fun. I think that games are a great excessory. Some people have long distance relationships right? Well, if you have a computer you can have an online. This relieves many people when they know your not there. If you have an email, you can talk"" to your friends that you dont see at school. This gives you a chance to connect with them. Myspace and facebook are very similar. These are what you can use to talk to your friends at school. Computers are very useful. As you can see, I have stated many good reasons. Excessories, ""talking"" to people. Also, places. Many people use computers in their every day life. Computers are awsome!"""	4	4	8
550	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be."	6	4	10
555	1	"Dear newspaper, I heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society. I believe that @CAPS4 has a negative affect on people. They get to interact with people who arent safe, they spend less time exercising and they get into more trouble thean before. Spending more time, online in chat rooms causes people to meet preditors. Take my friend @PERSON5 she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. She thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was @NUM1 and a model. She flirted with him on and on, day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really @NUM2 and a pervert. @PERSON5 @CAPS1 the only on that this has happened to @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this. Website designer @PERSON2 say, ""More and more people everyday are falling for lies over the @CAPS5 and getting in sticky situations like getting asked to meet the person."" @CAPS1 the saying ""@CAPS2 talk to strangers?"" Spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising. At triputs, this girl @PERSON4 wasnt in shape enough to stay up with the players. Instead of being our practicing like the rest of us, she was in her house talking on facebook. She wasnt prepared when @CAPS4 came, time to show what you had so she didnt make the softball team. The next year she made captain because she was out training everyday before the big day. She's not the only one with a laziness problem. @NUM5 out of every @NUM6 americans are couch potatoes and choose to go online than to stay in shape. Nutritionalist, @PERSON1 says, ""This generation is worse than the last. They complain when they cant do something but thats because instead of going outside, they're on their butts watching @CAPS3 or online."" @CAPS4's a breath of fresh air, what do you have to loose? Kids seem to get in alot more trouble online then they ever have on the streets. They're out posting threats, dissing each other, sending personal messages or pictures and worst of all sometimes hurting someone so bad they commit suicide one year. The neighbor was more popular than this lady's daughter so she created this person online that the neighbor fell for. The online ""guy"" began trashing the teenage girl so bad she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer @ORGANIZATION1 have been caught in sexting. @CAPS4's embarrasing, innappropriate and against the law yet @CAPS4 still happens. These people are not alone. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people have gotten in big trouble through the @CAPS5. Governer, @PERSON3 says, ""@CAPS5 and phones are destroying this society. Theres too much real life drama already."" @CAPS6't you see something wrong with all of this? My opinion on @CAPS4 all is that we should use the computers less before we all start interacting with people that will scare us, become couch potatoes, and get into huge trouble. @CAPS4's really not worth the damage of getting scared, hurt, lazy, or taking your own life."	5	6	11
602	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 know becoming reaching not only are computers are very helpful machines. Computers supply people with online education, hand eye and creativity, and computers are one of the main To begin, computers supplied large amount of people with On the computer you can anything In fact my cousin @PERSON2, earned his degree in accounting through college @PERSON2 now has a well having job in accounting. Without the computer people would not be where they are in life right now. Not to menchion just @DATE1 I was assigned to complete a history paper on @LOCATION2.

So @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 editors, writers, and readers. Computers are helpful machines, more the mist are missing out on using a computer.	4	4	8
607	1	Dear newspaper, I read an article in the newspaper that said how people on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit. I actually think its a good idea about people being on their computers. I have a few reasons why this is a good thing. Whenever a student needs information on a certain topic, then they use the internet for help. Research is helpful because there could be a lot of sites on-line that could give you what you need. The topics typed into search engines will help find any information help to you. Whenever a teacher @MONTH1 need an assignment typed, you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day. You can also find interesting pictures on what you're learning about. Sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into. It would sometimes be a good idea not to search for something all night, or someones going to be mad at the electricity bill. Also, it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake. Using the internet doesn't need to be for work only. People use computers to shop on-line, check times for movies, and talk with friends. People talking to friends on-line is good because they @MONTH1 not be able to talk however they want in school, and you @MONTH1 not get to see them on the weekends. Teens who talk on-line usually talk with their best friends. If one friend on a group of friends probablly in the same town as you, then they could talk by using their laptops they bring anywhere. Then you could probably hear about something that you (and your friends) have in common which @MONTH1 be coming somewhere that's by where you live. So being on the computer to talk with friends isn't so bad. Students who are young, usually get to learn to type. This could help them in the future if you need to type up an assignment for school, a job application, or college application. Learning to type is good because you also get to see which keys are where and wont need to look at them alot. Soon, you would be able to type a certain amount of words in a short amount of time. This @MONTH1 also be help with reading and understanding big words. In conclusion, I think, computers don't hace too much of an effect on people. As long as they'er not on there for more than two hours, then they're fine. Using the computer seems to have more advantages than disadvantages.	4	5	9
626	1	Does computers have an effect on people? Do they have a good effect or bad effect. Dear Local Newspaper, I agree they have a good effect on people because you can learn from them, you can can look at maps if your leaving out the state there good to talk to people online, you can shop online. I don'@CAPS1 think adults spend too much time on computers than exercising I think kids mostly on the computer playing games and other activities, some people use computers for homework, writing papers, or searching for people. Computers are good ways to learn about people and words, there not just for playing games and listening to music, there for good use, you can look up restaurants and look at there prices, @LOCATION1 shows site you can look at episodes of @CAPS1.V. shows online. I think computers are better than books and dictionary because you can do all that stuff on a computer. Some people think computers are good things to have cause its fast and easy. Some people thnk computers are a waste of time on them. Computers are good because if you need to write a paper you can type it and print it instead of having messy hand writing, computers are good for if your in a rush to search something its fast. Computers are useful for anything like books, writing paper, websites, chatting with friends web maps, music, games and etc, they do have a good effect on people and kids. 	3	4	7
627	1	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I do agree that exercising,. I think that people exercising more, and spend time with family and friends. The issue to with is should more people sometime on their less time, exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends should it be the other way around. The first reason why I think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because I think that more to watch and watch the way they eat and keep that self fit because what responsible to see their kid eat and then out exercising and then then self. My second reason is I think that people should time enjoying nature then computer The reason I think this id because they would never would never know what going on computer. How can you never things do. My third reason is interacting with friends and family I think that people should friends and family then on the computer because interacting with friends and family you learn things that you never knew about then and you can places you never gonna be sure discover new things you never your life. For example over vacation I did things and things about my family and friends than I never know why because I people interacting I learned how fun they really are and intering and happy. Have fun where is the computer. Please don't your life live your life. It's now or never should 'people spend more time on or more time exercising. interacting with family and friends.	4	4	8
629	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 the ages, technology has constantly been evolving and improving the way we think. From the first simple telephone in the @DATE1's to today's touch-screen iphone.

We have even reached the moon and left our ! Computers have only become faster and. Although more and more people are using one of our greatest technological advances, computers, believe it doesnt benefit socialy. I veherrertly believe that computers benefit. They have the ability in and teach us what seems like information, second, they have made the could a smaller place through communication. Last, they even have the ability to locate missing people. Computers are constanly helping society. They follow what technology to make life @CAPS3. First of all, computers are a benefit to society because they have the ability to and teach teach us what seems like infinite information. Today, when soneone know/wants to some first place they usually that's light the. This is because engines such as @ORGANIZATION1 have of limits to with much information on the topic being.

Today, you can easily video a rective in @LOCATION2 from @LOCATION1 in less that ten seconds. Not only can you talk to grandma or grandpa but you can even see them smile what children can even such as @CAPS4. When there is a they can still talk to warry of. Finally, computers benefit society have the ability to locate missing people. The record earthquale in @LOCATION3. cries of mothers children whom they from. It is to computers that these families were scuniled. On many sites on the internet, @LOCATION3 set up person locators. These locators allowed you to write down your name disaster should over happen. Not only this you family. All they had to do me! Computers have even made our society. What move could. In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers society is because computers contain much informations and programs they have proven the earth is a ""small world after all"" and they have made the world safer. It is that many people are buying computers, so why don't you get one?"	5	6	11
643	1	"Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the ""great deals"" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a ""great deal?"" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!"	5	5	10
647	1	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information. So please make te right chose and think about what computers do for us. 	6	5	11
651	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people have been doing less exercise and not enjoying the great outdoors. They're some people that are having less family and friends times. I say its computers!"" This machine is a great resource, but people are starting to get adicted to it. We need to reach a messgae to those people. Yesterday, I went to my local library and found @NUM1 computers in the library. All of the computers were filled with people and, a line with @NUM2 people ready to go on next. I ask those @NUM2 people ""why were they there?"" ""for homework"" said a teenager. Another, ""just to come and paly"". I also ask, ""how do they stay fit?"" ""I don't like @CAPS1 fit"" said beautiful lady. ""@CAPS1 fit isn't esay if your always on the computer"" said the teenager. The response I got from those people, were unbelievable. If we don't stay fit how are we going to survivie from all these dieases and cancer. This reason has pently to do witj not @CAPS1 fit. I don't know about you but I care about my family, I would never spend the rest of my life infront of a computer instead of my love ones. In the of , I was surprise to find out that projects, homework and research can take up half of your time, with your family. Do the computer, you can find some resort for you and your friends and fanily, you can't be doing for more than minutes. The great out doors should be one of the best places to be. because it quit, its amazing and its a large area. If you looking up the out doors on a computer, now thats a of time, that you could have been with a family member in the or where ever. My father says its great to buit its to live it. The days are getting shorter lets live it like."""	4	4	8
655	1	Dear local newspaper, I think computers are used way to much in this society! People spend more hours sitting the computer than exercising because people find it more thrilling spending more time with computers than trreadmills! People in this society think we are spending to much time on the computers, while others don't realize how long they've been staring at a screen for! I am one of those people who like using the computer a lot but I have relized changes. I can tell many others and spend to much time with the computer screen that we have drifted away from our familys! I never really thought about how much I don't talk to them anymore because I'm to busy cyberly chatting with friends. Although, I don't think we should get the computer either. Online we can research almost everything in the world. I can even type my name in a research bar and find me and anybody else with the excel same name as me! The internet got for more technical in the past years. Without it, these days, just about everybody would be lost! The internet should be used less on blogging and chatting, and should be used more on things more useful like @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you consider this.	3	4	7
659	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them. Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go aginst them when they benafit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world.	5	5	10
673	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 my opinion on this is that people do use computer's a lot! Some people dont care about exercising, or enjoying nature, maybe people dont even have friends so they spent a lot of there time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. For example @CAPS2.com, people/kids have one of those? They chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends. Enyways thats my opinion. Another opinion is that I think people should not spend most of there time on the computer. I think that because people should be having fun, socializing with people, and living there life! So this is what I I think, my opinion about ""Computers""."	3	3	6
681	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I am going to inform you that more and more people are using computers then spending time with their family. I agree with the effects computer haves on people, because one it allows us to access information, two it allows us to interact with people. And three because it helps us updated on what is happening in sports or everything. My first reason why we should use computers is because it gives us information, like the weather reports, school openings, delays, and closings. It also tell's us how @LOCATION1 has been after the earthquake. It tells us alot of stuff. It allow's to go to other websites to find information to. And it allow's us to have fun and play games on the internet. It can help us on our homework. And it can help us find things like job and other stuff. My second reason why we should use computers is because we can ineract with people. We can talk to people weve never ever met before. We can find information about them and tell us how is their life litte. it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them. It is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them. And it can make people have fun which will make them stay on the computer for a long period of time. My third reason why we should use computers is because it would keep us updated on and for these who love to watch it would tell us the most recent on teams and players. And if you a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer. And we can be able to post games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans. In conclusion this why we should use computers because it can give us information all over the world, two it can allow us to interact with people weve never met before. And three it will keep us updated on sports we like to catch especially if your a sports fanatic.	4	4	8
702	1	My opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you but people should not us the computer to lot because people should exercise, interacting with family and enjoy nature. Exercising is more important than a computers because it will make you health, you will not be sick so much. Interacting with family is more important than a computers because the @MONTH1 help you have friend but not a family's help you when you help and maybe that friend in the computer is maybe not real that is why it is important to interacting with family. And the last thing that is more important than a computers is enjoying nature. It is fun because you are not bored. You be outside, you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much. My opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer.	3	3	6
733	1	Honestly, I totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the @LOCATION2, because of many reasons. And here are just a few of them. First of all, the internet can make people very obese, for example, if your friend was going to a walk to your house, but then decided to @CAPS1 you instead, he is probably not getting a lot of exercise. As a matter of fact, the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 is no longer cigarettes. It's obesity. Actually @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, with that number still rising. Another reason why internet use should be cut down because bullies, hacker, and terrorists. Because. And the some I believe that child in the @LOCATION2	4	4	8
745	1	Dear @STATE1's newspaper editors I have recently read an atical that was talking about how experts are concerned that people are spending way too much time on their computers. Well I agree with them. I strongly belive that computers are tacking time away from you exercising enjoying nature and even interacting with family and friends. Well if you look at teen's this day and how more and more are becauming over weight like back in the days when their wasn't computer or internet not as much people were over weight or even obiste because they had time to go out and exercis or play sports with othes. Exercising is importent because espeshaly when as a teen you are over weight or even obiste well theis problems just don't go away this will cost you in the futer because not only do you have to chance of getting deobetice but you also have to pay for all the medications and treatments that comes with it. Experts also belives that by spending time on the computer will tack time away from enjoing the things that nature has to offer. When other might argue to it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of place's in the world. Well I delive why do you have to just read about the places online and look of the picture why can't you be the one tacking the pictures for other to see. And why can't you be the one experincing it insted of just reading about it. Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is tacking away time from you being able to interacting with family members and friends. Well as a teen myself I have learned that by intercating with family and friends are vary important to our health. I am not the only person that agrees with that because study shows that kid that can talk to their perents and have good convercations with their parent have the ability to do well in school and have more respect towed others verces the the kid or teen that can't really have conversation or talk to their parents. For example if you are the type of person that talk to your family You will have good grades such as A's and @CAPS1's and will learn to have respect for other and the person that can't talk to their parents have troble concentrating or even macking troble fro themselfs and getting @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's. Well I know that as a @STATE1 newpapper editer you are a vary busy person and have lot of diffent things to do but I hope you take this in to concideration and remmember the importants of exercisin, enjoying rotune and interacting with familys and friends.	5	4	9
756	1	Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to let you know that many people are spending to much time on computors rather than enjoying nature. People say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying. Many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us. Im going to saying that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Im thinking that in some points many family members and friends see then other relative person on companion so much on the computers it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can effect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision.) @CAPS1 more and more people should lay off it. @PERSON1 of yale university has conducted extensive reaserch and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damage of using it every time. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on something to let them later on have the spaare time to enjoy and have fun with nature but something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves. Whatsoever im hoping from you to agree with my position so this can be possible to break this habit of going on computers and having no time for your family and friends is not such a to start off with.	4	4	8
790	1	Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is helpful? It provides useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as for talking to friends. If there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can help you. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer! These are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, an @CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home this will. Make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to cant up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost @CAPS10 plan on earth. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone phone number but don't have a phone book you can use @CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can see that computers effect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can help in multiple ways. Having a computer could make you have draw perspective of everything.	5	4	9
791	1	@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and i just want to tell you that we should stop using computers because we get no exercise, we barely go outside and we don't even or talks to our friends or family any more. Local newspaper i think that we should have computer but not because many people aren't doing anything. Many people aren't exercising because their taking on facebook or playing games. Many children aren't even going outside and seeing nature and playing. Many families are all on computers and they are not spending any family time together gofly kites. What im saying is that yeah people like computers and go and talk to there friends and play games but its destroying the parents and and even families. i don't think have computers. Also local newspaper we need to go and the @DATE1 and go doesn't happen. many children go they're on the computer. many parents go hiking, camping, swimming and lots of other stuff but they that anymore. These people need to get a change. What im talking you guys is take the computer away or. One last thing local newspaper is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time. Maybe if and parents weren't all they they would pick that might be sick or ill. Maybe they might go out somewhere to have two together like lake or six flags. many parents that they get computer because it's so fun so they. Many people world complain about it. So i think everybody should be off computers. i think we shouldn't have computer society because you get no exercise, you barely go outside and see nature and you hang out or talk with friends and family so i think computers gone now.	4	4	8
792	1	Computers are good for school uses, skills, and just for fun. Computers are a good source to have, now that is just my opinion. But, I think computers are mostly for pre-teens and teenagers. Adults mostly use them for business. The fun uses that the computer provides are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. @CAPS1 is one of the most popular chat groups on the internet, @CAPS2 is another popular chat group. They both have some of the same characteristics like chatting to your friends, updating your status every now and then uploading pictures, songs, etc. There are websites that could be used for free time like music websites where you are allowed to watch music videos or downlosd music onto your ipod. @CAPS3 is a website teenagers of kids go on to watch some of their favorite music videos. Itunes is the program where you can download any song, music video, tv show, or movie onto and ipod. Computers also provide microsoft @CAPS5, publicher, powerpoint, etc. All these can be used for school purposs. @CAPS5 allows you to type up anything you want for school. You can type up a @NUM1 page essay if you wish. You can cut and paste pictures for a project you might have due. You can change the colors, font size, and font style on @CAPS5. That use could be for a design on the front of a cover page for an essay or project. Publisher can be used for projects as well. In school of you need to make a newspaper, flyers, business cards, etc. publisher alloews you to make them. Powerpoint is a program where you can make different slides in anything. Computers can be put to good use for many different things. If people don't agree with that then they don't understand that computers help children and adults with everyday things. Some kids who have special needs @MONTH1 need the computer to comunicate with others. Computer, I think, are a big help in the world.	4	4	8
797	1	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are an advance in technology, in a good way. They do benifit are society grately. Its a way that family members can keep in touch, it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work. They can bring people together. Firstly, they are a great way to keep in touch. In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him. Do you have someone, you don't get to see everyday? It can really make your family closer, because you talk more, with your realitives, and with friends. Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them. In a time of pain all you want is a friend. When the friends away, a computer probably helped our, too, just getting there. Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal, waitting on the phone for hours, at end, with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes. I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but didn't know until, she went on the computer and checked. So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not. With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like. It well even say if there delayed so you don't wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likly. Yes once you were happy you had a computer. On the other hand, it also helps with your education. When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out, mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat. About nine out or ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know thats happened to me. As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned. You could use your computer. Most schools use some or device, here at @CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post, grades, test/quizs coming up and homework. It's just one click away from every thing we need. It all right there, together. Most @CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come, in with there homework then without. Wouldn't you be? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there. In conclusion, computers do help us from everyday use. to special uses. It helps use make are family stronger, help us keep are flight out and help us get homework, for school the next day. Computers are a help to the society, in a great and convienent way.	5	5	10
832	1	Dear editor, computers are good for people because it really helps with they work and home work and other stuff.	1	1	2
833	1	Dear Local Newspaper, Are you spending all your precious time on a computer? On the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games. You shoudn't spend alot of time on the computer it will just wash away your brain. You shoudn't go on computers for a long time because instead you should be exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. First of all, spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising. On computers you can't jog the fat you gain by eating food. By jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen. Nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games. but isn't it better to play a real sport like soccer. In soccer you have to use your mind and alot so it is much better than sitting or laying around dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time. Don't you love playing outdoor games! Like playing tag or hiding go seek isn't that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen? For me I think it is. That is my reasons I think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen. Secondly, you shouldn't be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful and refreshing unlike a computer. Yeah I know computers offer alot but do they offer the fresh air outside, the warm breeze land living animals the earth. I don't think so and neither should you. Instead of going on your computer when it is raining not you should play with your pets and if you don't have any put a raincoat umbrella and go outside. Especially in the @DATE1 you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park. There is more to often in use than going on the computer. More importantly, you shouldn't go on the computer because you are better off. Interacting with living people in person. On the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression. So get off the computer and hang with your family and friends. Get into a fun conversation or debate. Make new friends when your at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you. Get your self out in the world don't just interact with people but the world not the computer screen. In conclusion you shouldn't spend most of your precious time on the computer. It isn't nessasary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exrcising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. I strongly beleive people should be outside than on a computer. So what are you waiting for get off that computer and take a hike!	5	4	9
853	1	"Dear local news paper, Computers are powerful machines in our world. Most people east, sleep, and drink computer. Thats when those people are forty and live with there mom, for the most part of computer are used by teenagers and buiness workers. Computers are a tool that need to be used in an everyday life. We all know and remembe when we were ""sick"" just so we could go to the office with mom or dad to draw pictures and spin in the office chairs. Well while we were busy playing mom and dad were busy as well. They talked to their boss, made copies, had meetings drank coffee, and most of all they spent half of the day doing work on the computer. It could of been making spread sheet, designing logos, editing someones or getting new clients. About ninety percent of the workers use the computer to do their jobs. they need to be senting work to other companies over sea's or just down one float. Computers need to be used to do most jobs in @LOCATION1. Also the computers in today's time are beautiful because they have the internet. The internet allows use to talk to people around the world and look things up like the news, the close bridle shop, the biggest shopping mall, biggest race car tract near you and pizza placer near you. The inernet can let you do many things. I know that hear in granby you have to but the newspaper, but instead of but the paper you can just go on you computer and chechk the news. Look up the weather, the celebrity gossip, and where the plance crashed that you mom told you about. The computer can give you great information but only if you know how to use it. One thing that I find great is that you can watch tv. and movies right from your computer. Then you don't need to buy all those high priced chanles to watch movies. You can see you favorite shows and moves. A big thing is that teenagers span a majority of there time on facebook, twitter or myspace. Some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family. You can let people know what you are doing or tell them you sad because your dog died. You just can use the internet for just about anything. Lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers. You don't need to go out and spend @MONEY1 on an album, you can now just buy a single song for a dollar. You can buy many things on the internet the clothes on food. Thats why the computer"	4	5	9
864	1	"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. This issue is debatable but really I think that computers are not helping the big picture. I don't think that they benefit our health or social actions because computers keep us inside when we could be out. Everyday when I come home from school, I find myself going straight inside and to the computer from there, I log into @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. And my exersize in the next @NUM1 hours or so is only in my fingers. My point is that there is a whole world outside of we only got off our computers and played outside. Statisctis show that @NUM2 kids spend more time inside year-round than out these days. ""@CAPS1 is ridiculous how much things have changed in just @NUM3 years."" says @PERSON1 a pediatrician in @LOCATION1, ""they all need thier exersize."" @CAPS1 is cutrogeous how much people are on computers now, @CAPS1 starts to affect thier attitude, and control thier lives. Sometimes checking notifications on @CAPS3 can be more important to someone than spending time with thier family or friends. A mom of @NUM4 teens says ""They all go to thier rooms, shut thier doors and go on @CAPS3 and @CAPS6 untill dinner and after, they go right back."" In this case, they just plug into thier computers and forget about everyone else. I think @CAPS1 has gotten out of hand how much people and teens especially are addicted to computers. 1/@NUM4 mom says she sees her kid growing apart from the family because of a computer. You @MONTH1 say that when on your computer there is a person you are talking to, and while pen-pals are great, you should really go out and do something! You are talking your friends, but its not the same as being with them. On my recent trip to @LOCATION2 to go skiing, I found that some of my friends jokes funnier when you're with her and not just sitting on a computer. We had a blast! Now I regret not getting together with her to hang out. Also @NUM6 arguments now, have something to do with a missunderstanding through the computer, people @MONTH1 get the wrong message when you send something to them or they take @CAPS1 the wrong way. The truth is, computers are starting to take negative effect on our society and even ruin relationships. If we just get off our computers and get out, we can turn that around."	5	5	10
875	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer benefits society due to the possitive affect on people. Such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1. I was working on a long history paper and @CAPS1 essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock off I went to my basketball grow, @CAPS2 the best game of my life was playerl. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that things use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethicities and relgion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology. In history, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through the knowledge of this hunger, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like myself do not eat for @NUM1 hours. Research has proven that @NUM2 children in countries of africa die a day from malnurutousment. Now that this has been brought to my attention, I am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what I consume. Thus through the use of computers I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it's my . Do you have family that's across the country that you are rarely able to see? My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3 and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we are only graced with their presenced about once a year we begin to miss them. But now through skype, email and facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @LOCATION4 as well as @CAPS2 they have recently traveled to. Also @PERCENT1 as the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spend at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I have moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 and staying in contact with my fr iends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth. The use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives. To conclude, due to improved hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online, with other people the use of computers benefits society. Through the internet, people can learn about @LOCATION2 places to travel bike and exercise while enjoying nature. Furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computer.	5	6	11
878	1	I think using the computer is great. You should heed my advice, people should be useing computers. Computers are an exelent way to comunicate. People can connect with others from all over the world. My dad moved to brazil so we have ben communicating via, @CAPS1-mail, @CAPS2, and even facebook. Its the easyest and cheapest way to comunicate. If I call someone from a different country it would cost me way more but if I send them an @CAPS1-mail its cheaper. Studys from the university of @LOCATION1 show that @PERCENT1 people think its easyer and to use a computer to comunicate. More over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds. Computers are indeed the best way to comunicate. Another thing computers are used I for as learning. Many people from around the world have learned diffrent languages from wed sites or programs that have great instruction and lessons. I learned to play guitar with maney programs and online lessons. Maney people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. My mom is a secretary at an inseurens broker companey. Without computers the coustemers couldnt learn about the diffren policeys that there are and they misth be spending more money then needed on insearence. With out computer scientests couldnt do much reasarch or learn about plants or rocks. Computers make it easyer for them to study and learn about @LOCATION2 and everything. Doctors wouldnt be adel to do half of the thing they can with out a computer. They learn about diffrent sicknesses and broken bones by useing computers. @PERSON2 said she couldnt be able to help out as many people with out the use and help of a computer she states that she learned @PERCENT2 of what she knows from websites that have in formation about the humin body. Even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from web sites. Builder and modern desiner @PERSON1 says he learned about different building designes that are sturdyer and stronge shapse he used this in his building today. I hope that you can how see how great computer are and how much they help our present day citizens.	4	5	9
900	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am aware that some people think computers have a negative affect on others, but I think it's the opposite. Computers have completely changed the world. People can save work on them, visually experience things they've never seen before, or even catch up with old buddies. In my opinion computers have a positive affect on people. With computers you can create documents, pictures, and even movies that will stay on your computer forever. How about your newspaper company? Does somebody hand write every paper that comes out? Without computers hundreds of copies of your newspaper wouldn't be able to b made every day. Not to mention, what would happen if you didn't use computers and a fire occured? All of your hard work will be turned into ash, but if it was on the computer you be able to retrieve it. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because throught the internet you can visually experience places or things you couldn't before. If I was going to book a vacation I wouldn't just trust a book, I would wont to go on the computer so I could see pictures, videos, or hundreds of other articles I couldn't see anywhere else. This goes for anything else like furniture, instruments or even cloths. Computers offer alternative views that books don't. Not only can computers save data and give you visuals, but they give you an oportunity to catch up with old friends, relatives, or even meet new people! Instead of endlessly searching through phone books you can just type in their name and you bound to find somewhere on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely easy. When my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! That wouldn't have been possible without computers. Computers truley do have a positive affect on people everywhere without them many things today wouldn't be possible. Hopefully others will agree with me too.	5	5	10
905	1	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I, a member of the public is writing a letter to you to inform you what I think about on the subject of if people spend to much time on the computer. My first idea is sometimes people do spend to much time on the computer than usual. Its a problem because some people began to become over wieght & start to lose control over the eating habits. My second idea is computers do alot of things for us. But there are still alot of things a computer cant teach us how to do. So computers are helpful but they're not always find something to do outside but whats sometimes different with a computer. My last & final idea is people become to attached to their computers & lose sight of what really matter, such as exercising & fitnesss. Then people are angry when their computer chrashes & forget how to do things because their always on the computer. And those are my ideas on the subject about if people spend to much time on the computer but not as much time with friends and family.	3	3	6
910	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 computers have help man kinds. Computers are every where in a schools, homes band business across a @CAPS1. They help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done. The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends, a family, and it also helps me with my school work. I have been a live for @NUM1 @DATE1 and have already live in @NUM2 different states: @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and now @CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you @MONTH1 use? I use various and @CAPS3. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore. Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen you family in @NUM3 @DATE1, well sadly thats my life so many birthday @CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents. School another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opoion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends, @PERSON1, said this about the dell computers we use in the library @CAPS4 ever u don't get something about what we learned in @CAPS5 class that day. I use the computers to better understand it. Computers are a great way to research a topic, and thats why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for two reasons for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least @NUM4 our writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something, like a @CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier. In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in @LOCATION2 through @CAPS7 it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the @ORGANIZATION2 it would take days. A life with out computers is a lot harder to do things, that we cant make simpler with computers"""	4	4	8
913	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have been informed that recently, people are questioning the use of computers. Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are changing the way everyday people live. This technology is the basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers. People learn so they can become better at things, be aware of what is going on, and to gain the knowledge that possibly help mem succed in life. Computers gona access to information that people want to know whether it is to learn how it dance using youtube.com, to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit, or to research a topic for a school paper: computers have it all. It sits right at home so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book with the right researching skills, almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for. Computers contribute to people who want to learn. Being a popular used computer have beenimportant to make them the best. Whether that means faster internet better, researching book or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephones was invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guarenteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their bestfriend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy. Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check there grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want. So we people say that the computer. If a sibling is away at college, their @CAPS3, when a family is to gether, they could since new things are discovered through the computer everyday. can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphazize the fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and that bring creativity to. This technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around ther block. Even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be. Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new word of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer. Communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people. It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things. Computers effect people in the greatest way and I don't know why some people doubt its magnificent ways of indudging people in the environment.	5	5	10
929	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself have a computer; it is very important and useful to me. Over @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer. Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in mu opinion. Based on these positives, @CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computers you could type ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter. having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, ""I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home."" @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definately. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long? Look at what they have involved into @DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient. These are major benefits to society, and everybody should embrace computers."	5	5	10
943	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home make it easer. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I dont know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topc for school there is always an endless library of information @CAPS6 you turn on the computer. You @CAPS7 get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time, to get to a local library. Also, @CAPS6 you have a project in school that you need to type, it is helpful to have a computer at home so you don't have to use at short. This way, you have more time to get extra from teachers @CAPS3 on instrument in the school band. I can imagine that my grades would be @CAPS6 i did have access to the internet of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 at home. Have you over pare or document and had an of her and happens @CAPS6 you own a computer you can backup @CAPS7 you imagine on essay five pages and organized is boring, biut you wouldn't think so @CAPS6 it saved you from hours worth of writing! For some people, having a computer @CAPS7 make you money, and who wouldn't like more money? You can run a business online and avoid the hastle of manting a @CAPS8 your own space or building to run your business can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, you can refrain from making a trip from the store by purchasing items online. Then, the item will be shipped to your door. You save time and money on gas by doing so. And thise days, any way to save money is a good one! By having a computer you can boost your education.Keep yourself organized, and save money. Although it has many recreational purposes as well, it also can be very helpful in your life. And besides, is perfectly fine, to go online to talk to your friends once in a while, isn't it?	4	5	9
948	1	"I am so happy, I just finished my school report on @PERSON1 and I didn't even need to leave my house. I was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online. I also managed to get all the information just from my computer. I also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river, I learned that by taking on online course. This is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vocation use the internet. The reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, beacuse it makes it easier for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says ""computers now offer programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software. ""@CAPS7 everyday @CAPS2 don't have time to go out a join a group or class to learn new skills. That is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. Instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another reason why computers are useful in vey positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an A in that class. Well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. Let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to long distance friends. That is why the effects on computers to people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is important that computers stay in our lives, they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running."	4	5	9
952	1	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the concerned experts, im sure many others agree also. I bet you that if you keep reading it would be understandable, why I agree. First of all, too many people spend to much time talking with friends online. I think that once you start talking with them online, finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone. Talking online is a great way to connect with friends and people you haven't seen in a long time, but too much of that can start problems. For example rumors. In my opinion when friends get to excited online they decide to start rumors about other people and it ends up being sent to almost everybody. Another example is online arguing which can lead up to many problems like fighting when you get back to school. How would you feel if you turned on your computer and find out that someone has been talking about you or that someone is trying to start a fight with you? I'm positive that you would not enjoy it and your feeling might be hurt. Next reason is, being on the computer too much can effect most peoples grades. Many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying. There are many people who go to my school and their grades have declined because of online usage. Pretty soon many people will be held back because they have failed the school year. For example, picture yourself as a parent and getting your child's report card and find out they have all @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's. You wouldn't like that either. Lastly, computers have cause another problem called bullying. Too many children are being bullied online and they are being hurt. Those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad. Thinking that nobody cares about them. Bullying has caused death or many other problems. Imagine, being someone, getting bullied and your feelings are really hurt, you dont talk to an adult or a parent all you end up doing is killing yourself. Picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too to find that their child has been bullied to death, it really hurts them. And i'm sure if you were one of those parents you wont be too happy. In conclusion, being online too much has an effect on everybody and	4	4	8
958	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun.	4	4	8
977	1	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion is yes people are on the computer to much. I have @NUM1 good reason why I think people are on the computer a lot. @CAPS1 first reason is people are losing time. Second not that much engry. Third you just spending your life on the computer keep on reading why I don't agree that it befits society to people. People losing time to have fun. They do have any time for friends family, pets, and scuh more. It mostly adicaution to go on website like facebook, myspace, @CAPS2, and such more people just need to get off the computer and have fun outside. Mostly people dont really get that much engry. Some people are always inside they just need engry. Fresh our will help that maybe going to the gym or jog outside for a while. Being inside isnt really good for you. Just being inside just make you kinda gang weight. And then you wouldn't have anytime with your friends, and more only if your inside like always. Fineally you spend all your time at home being computer. And you don't have anytime, engry and such more. YOu spend all your time inside computer cool technology but you don't need to be on it @NUM2. You just have time for friends and family. Now you know @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benfit society. People are losing time and everything. People dont have anymore engry. And your spend all your time on the computer. Bye for now.	3	4	7
978	1	"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your town, or even failing @CAPS5 you didnt ha a @CAPS3? I know I couldnt. Some of the great benefits of having a @CAPS3 are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able study for and tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the @CAPS3. Facts show show that @PERCENT1 of families in the @LOCATION1 have distant friends with @CAPS2, now all of these people can tlk to each other! Ill never forget the time that my close freinds moved, but i was still able to talk to him @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3. Second, the @CAPS3 allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have I know about some of the places I've been to if it was for comoputer, @ORGANIZATION1 stated that the @CAPS3 expert @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 are the reason we have in much without @CAPS3 wouldn't know about the places."" @CAPS4, it is now possible study without @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3, @CAPS6 can be done on the internet online. I'll never forget the that I forget my book, but I @CAPS1 still study @CAPS5 of the online book. In conclusion the @CAPS3 has benifits to you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. Computers are just end all-around benifits."	4	4	8
985	1	"Dear @CAPS1, "" Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me, i can't live without a computer."" @CAPS2 my many local in the town of @LOCATION1. For me, computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications. But they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine. I also think tha computer is important because it is where businessmen do their job. My favorite part about the computer are applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps. are great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state, @CAPS3. Easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and so many other endless possibilities, You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very fun to do things on the computer that you enjoy, and not have to research all the time. The second thing on the computer, is research. Researching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, But researching is educational, and I asked a mother with a @NUM1 year old, a @NUM2 year-old, and a @NUM3 yearl-old and she said ""The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. Its's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The best thing about researching is that, there are endless amounts of websitees that have information for us to look at, and enjoy. People that work and have jobs, are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them ar researching while working. People that work, are th ones that are basically on the computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc.... The computers are mostly used by workers for e-mail. My father is always on the computer, checking e-mails, typing something for this boss; and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because foe some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, they'are one of the best things created. They are the best because they ahve amazing apps. for me to have fun on. But they also provide an educational opportunity through research. And they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person that can live without one of these technological beauties."	4	5	9
986	1	Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 say that they spend most of their time on the computer. I think computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues, health issues, and ofcourse education issues. With all this new technology, teenagers aren't aware of their surroundings at all. On top of that, they're not aware of what's happening to them. Adults also do use the computer, but not as frequent as us teenagers. It's time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today. Computers can cause safety issues. Now more than ever people use where they talk to friends. But, what they don't know is that the person on the other side might not be what they think it is. Lately, on the news we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because of people who they were talking on the internet was not who they said they were. Bad people are always lurking on the internet, and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids. But, even besides having bad people online, computers can with your privacy. It's possible for computers to give out your information to other people so, we really need to watch out. Computers though not only cause safety issues, but health issues also. Computers play a major part in destroying our health. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. T.V's use to be the issue for people not excercising, but now computers are doing just the same. There are so many things to do on the computer that just doesn't make you bored. That there means that there is no way to from it. But, you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so. It's like it's hypnotizing us because we simply don't want to get up. Computers can also have an impact with your vision. I know that after a long time on the computer I have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad. Also, computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally. Talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another, but computers again are preventing this. Besides interfering with our computers do the same with education. Computers can really be bad with our education. Students now easily forget to do homework. There are so many distractions today that than of them whom people spend a long time on it, we forget to do other things that we're suppose to do simply becausewe're distracted. But, eventhough we forget our homework, we also @MONTH1 forget to study before a test. This would result in a in high grades. Computers shouldn't be distracting people, but instead helping them. I think it's not the people to not get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features. For example, the internet, and websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, etc. We have so many distractions in our that we don't need more! Computers really don't have a good effect on people. More and more people get computers everyday. They should know what its doing to them, and what's happening to the world around them go outside and enjoy nature? Maybe, go to the mall with friends and. There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day. People need to stop being and open their eyes to see the effect computers have on people.	6	5	11
996	1	Dear @CAPS1 I heard a lot of people are spending to much time in the computers and less time exercising, enjoying the nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion I think you should know the compouter because it helps for school homework or projects, talking to family far away and finding new friends. My first reason why we should keep computers is because it @MONTH1 help on school homework or projects. This is my top reason because its really helpful and its useful when you need it also if your computer its not working you can go to your friends house and use computers, when your done you can save on hardrive and print it in your school's computers. My segond reason why you should keeps computer is talking to family. Without the computer you can't communicate with family. In my opinion computers are very helpful to cummnicate with family. If your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family. My third reason is communicating and find new friends without the who are you going to meet and communicate with you can communicate with your family throught the computer, or even if your running late you can send them a message through the computer. In my opinion I think the computer its a really good way to communicate with your family. I know that people say they spend to much time in the computers and its addicting, but its good for school work like projects and assignments, also people said its just to what on the but in my opinion we should keep computers because its no to see whats on the other person. Its to do school work and talk to family. I know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not. In my opinion, we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family. I think what you should do its not get rid off computers.	3	4	7
1003	1	Dear Newspaper, People should play with their family and friends instead of staying on the computer all the time. People would be more fit, have closer bonds with their family, and get better grades in school. People will alway get fit faster if they excersise instead of staying on the computer. When the computer is unpluged, anyone has a chance to go out side and play. When people go outside to play with their friends, they excersise which causes you to lose weight. @NUM1 scientist believe that it is better to go outside and socialize than to sit on a computer and watch monontenious videos. People would be more active if they stay of the computer and went outside because it will keep you happy with your body, and healthy so you don't die of a terrible diseases. Their would be closer bonds with families if people stayed of the computer. Family would be closer together instead of spreading apart by computers. Your family is always their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day. Your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward. If you did this by computer, all you see is a persons face who can't comfort you with a hug. Without computers, you get a closer family that loves and supports each other, but with computers, people just drive their families away. Closer families also help children in school get better grades. Families who stay of the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades. @NUM2 scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school. If kids get better grades in school from staying of the computer and spending quality time with their family, we could get great inventions that can help mankind in every single way. All of can happen from staying off of computers. Staying off computer is a great way to help yourself and other people to. It would get people fit, create closer bonds, and create more gradutes who go on and achieve the greatest of all inventions. Imagine what else could happen by staying of computers.	5	4	9
1005	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are ""taking over people"", I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languges and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family. Lastly, @NUM3) @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad."	4	5	9
1011	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common by now, but people argue rather they are really needed on our society. Computers give negative effects on people, for example, lose eye sight, interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise. One out of five people wear glasses or contacts, these days. the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes to lose eye sight. When people use too much computers, their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as well. These are sign of spending too much time, but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done, or simply addicted to the online video games. this shows that computers give terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there is no limitation to him or her. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted. Online, where anyone can go on, there are millions of people that are not connected or related. In other words, strangers, interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. They can have devastating influence, no supremacy, what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort. Unfortunatly, people can not trust anyone online because they don't know who it exactly is. For example facebook. People think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person. this is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. These people get not enough exercises, which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. For the reason, people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society because, they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight. Second, they are creating a unsafe environment. last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet. 	4	4	8
1014	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought about people's veiws on certain technolgy? While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers, and are waisting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can help with homework, interacting with people, and even help us with exercising. You'll find that in the end, computers end up as benefits for everyone. For many students, they need computers to help them understand their subjects. There are certain websights that give online lessons. Along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework. My math teacher, @PERSON2, is always saying,""@CAPS1 into the online sight."" I've found that it really helps me when I'm struggling with my work. We can also ask our friends with help if we still @CAPS4't understand. That's not all we can do. There are certain sights like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 where we can interact with other people. You can talk to them when they're out of town and have no cell-phone. You can also tak when the phone is being used and you have something importain to tell them, such as helping them with their homework. When there's no telephone reception between each other, they can still talk over one million people in the @LOCATION1 use these sights. People are wrong when they say it takes their time away from exercising. Many websights give good tips on how to lose weight. The show many dieting plans such as @PERSON3 or @PERSON1. Not only that, but they also have exercise plans. It's not the computer's fault, it's the people who @CAPS4't ""stick"" with exercising. Also, the computer reccomends many great gyms you can join, like @LOCATION2 fitness. @CAPS4't you think that's a good ""deal?"" @CAPS4't listen to those other people stick with my opinion that computers are benefits for everyone. They can help us with many things, above and beyond. I can't imagine life without them. Most everyone uses computers! Thank you for reading."	4	4	8
1040	1	Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON2 and I am here to give you @CAPS1 opinions about computers. Computers are fun and educational. They have lots of websites for games. Such as portaportal, @NUM1.com, they have safe fun games for kids under @NUM2. They also have educational websites that help you with your work. Such as google. Ask your question.com these websites have all the info on things you need help with. They also have @CAPS2, facebook. Yes I know there has been rumors about people threatening over chats. But other than that your able to chat with your friends instead of waiting for your mom to get off the phone. @CAPS2 lets you meet new people without having to tell them who you are. @CAPS1 opinion is that computers are safe in different occassions but are also very fun & educational.	3	3	6
1041	1	I think that people shouldnt use the computer's that much because it make's you want to be on it and on it day. Like yea you can play games on it and talk to people like other people you use of lec see I can understand that but the other people around you like that live's with you people that on the computer all day can spend time with there family and friends and to other places then going to look at them on the computer's I mean like to see other people that you see on the computer like chat or like webcam on the computer, you can maybe go see in a other state and go visited them. then being on the computer people that always on the computer should get out because there never going to do things is they are always on the computer, like when @CAPS1 on the computer @CAPS1 on it for a hour are so the I do things with family and friends, but not all the time that @CAPS1 on it, like i understand if you work on the computer at work and then finishing things at home for your work, but once in a you get to spend some time with family and friends, not @CAPS4 be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and @CAPS4 go on the computer and that how people get lazy the start getting fat because they @CAPS4 go on the it and maybe stop to eat and back on the computer, then when they get off of it they will eb all tierd and stuff not feeling like going anywere @CAPS4 to sleep or like if they had sometimes to do after they would be all lazy an not wanted to do anything at all, that why people should get out more and do thing withe there family and friends to have fun withe there like.	3	3	6
1044	1	"Do you really think @CAPS1 need computers to live? I agree on spending less time on the computers and spending more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. I this because @CAPS1 and family. And @CAPS1 don't need computer @CAPS1 don't need computers @CAPS2 @CAPS1 are lost on and don't know where @CAPS1 are @CAPS1 get @CAPS3, not @CAPS2 @CAPS1 need to look for something @CAPS1 use ipods. If some people like to chat with each other they use cell phones. Lets say you have a project in class libraies are available. @PERCENT1 of kids like to read. A is great way to bring your reading up. If you don't get that right ideas @CAPS2 you read then you can ask your teachers, @CAPS2 it is appropriate time. Like afternoons or during lunch time. One day @CAPS2 I went to class there was a project due and kid said ""I copy all of the words for the computers."" And that is call pradizing. So some parents don't see there children pladerize. Sometimes internet is not good for children. Sometimes you need take a break and slow down. You can take a trip and see your family. You can also look out to nature. Exercise, hike, swim and bike. Computers are not family there are not going to make you exercise there going to make you lazy. Now that you've heard about why you should stop going to the computers because you have electronics, libraies and family. You stop and make a change right now. There nothing to loose. "	3	4	7
1046	1	Do you like your computer? Does it benifit you and the around you? People are saying that computers dont benifit people. I am writing to prove them wrong, and state why computers benifit us. It helps us with things like learning, communication, and even money or economic problems. First, learning is a very important in a lifetime and computers can help you increase that one hand-eye coordnation is very helpful in different sports like tennis, golf, and hackey too. When you go on the computer, you learn that skill. For example, last @DATE1 i went to tennis with mom and shes never on the computer. She missed every ball thrown to her. Thru computers all around the world, and going on the computer can open you to the whole world. You can see places like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and even @LOCATION3. Overal, has the least computers out of the whole world. Finnaly, computers let you learn typing. In america, there are jobs that are for you to type. If you to type, then you a good job. If you get a good job, then you can be succesful in life. Computers definetly benifit your learning. Second, when. Computers open you up met new friends. One, when you go to school, more with other student. Computers let you talk your you right. According to facebook magazine, @PERCENT1 of all the students in a school chat and talk online to other person. Two, the computer can help you communicate with your family too for instance. If your her got hurt, could e-mail that grandmas hurt. Computers can your family too. Finnaly, computer half in life. For example, kids with cancer, or even need to check them can let you talk to this kinds in. Computer very helpful when social life. Finnaly, computers help you. In that economy it's really hard to find a job. So the computer can help you with that websites online make you take a actualy gives you a place to work.	4	5	9
1052	1	"Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today, prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities? My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day. The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise, children tend to be addicted to playing on the computer, and if someone's life revolves around the computer than they most likely, won't be able to live on the ""real world"". When a child sits at the computer all day, they are not getting exercise. Today, obesity is a major problem. If people stay on the computer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease. Also, it is important for children to get fresh air. When someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors. Lastly, who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports, to stay active and have fun. Once you begin to play games on the computer, there is not turning back. In today's society, children of all ages, become addicted to the computer. Children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings. Also, some of these games might be inappropriate for younger players. Lastly, if children become addicted, they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework. If a child is constantly on the computer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the ""real world."" In the ""real world,"" you can't rely on computer games. Also, games won't teach you things that you can only learn during school. Later in life, when you want to get a job, you won't be able to be accepted because you will not sound knowledgable. Lastly, when you are writing your application to go to a college, they will look at your records of sports and activities you've done in middle school. When they don't find anything, they will reject you because of your lack of participation. So when you are sitting at the computer screen, remember all the possibilities you have other than the computer. For example, it is important for you to exercise, playing games on the computer could make you addicted and you won't be prepared for te ""real world"". What is your opinion?"	4	5	9
1056	1	Many people say that computer is help them in their every day life. A few examples are you could learn about places you didn't know about by searching on google. You get facts reviews about the place. You are exercising your fingers. It helps with communicating with other people. It can help you find long lost family. It reunites lots of family & friends you might have been looking for. Also with hand & eye coordination. And that means you can write/type without having to look at other features that cames through with a computer is going online. You can look & browse at things available in a store. Without driving all the way to the store & wasting gas & polluting the air. I.Ms a way of finding what's happening world wide & breaking news. You can still interact with family & friends & can meet new people. There's e-mail, instant messaging & much more. So you can always interact with & if they dont have a account signing up is. If you just go into nature you don't know what's there. You could look it up and find out what the park has to offer. And that concludes my opinion on how computers are helpful & lots of diverse ways.	3	3	6
1058	1	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. Computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. Computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficent and that i like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. Finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. If you give a person to coose from a computer or a set of encyelpedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or enclyelpedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficent than books. In conclusion, i believe that computer have a posieve effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficent and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers.	4	4	8
1065	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I do not no where to start this letter. Im writing you this letter to let you know that I think that not everyone should use a computer. My first reason not everyone should use a computer is because they get so distracted in the computer they forget about school. My second reason not everyone should use a computer is because they @CAPS4 dont spent time with there parent. My third reason they shouldn't have people use the computer often is because they would get sick. My firs reason computer shouldnt be used often is because they forget about school. They forget about it in the way that there so distracted writing or chating or playing @CAPS4 that they forget about school. @CAPS5 reason is because their grades get low. They dont do homework either. My second reason is because they dont parents. Are more could be there so the computer they dont. My third reason is because their get computer there get @CAPS4 they dont and not @CAPS5 could that they dont get no education for being in the computer. That is why is bad to use a computer a lot I hope u understand.	3	4	7
1071	1	Dear local newspaper, I think that using a computer can benifit people and have a negative on people. Benifits could be, gaining knowledge, and meeting new people, bad effects could be, weight gain, and having a lack of social skills to talk with friends over phone etc. First, gaining knowledge is really essential. The I think that is because when your computer crashes or breaks you would most likely know what to do to fix it. I dont think you would want to have to pay money to get anti software that probubly doesn't work. Anothe reason why I think that gaining using computer is good because what if you want become a computer enginere, all that time you've spent on the computer could really benifit you later on in life. Secondly I think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states. Not you have to meet them in person you could just have a friendly consversation online. The thrid and last reason why sometimes computers can be bad for you is weight gain. Most are probably so much time on the computer that there not getting enough physical activities. All they do is sit down eat on unhealthy snack and play games, and videos. That's really bad for your health. I conclusion using a computer moderately is a lot better then using a lot. It could help gain knowledge, meet new people or make you gain weight and have a lack of social skills.	4	4	8
1079	1	Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a possitive effect on people because you could chat online. There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. And you can pay your bills on the computer. People that have no phone od don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website can chat to friends and family. Also many people that have websites like facebook, myspace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. And some people do find that @CAPS1 person that they been looking for. I think that they jusy come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn there alaphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling, This is a good product for little kids so they cam use the extra work over, the @DATE1 or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. One day I had my mother what she was doing and the light bill so i was like how can you and she said and a website bt I forgot what's it called and you could pay your bills right there. So instead of up going in your are go to a local show when thay pay bills and can like or if you get a computer you can do that in you home with no . So people who publish the newspaper I think and I hope you think to this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time.	4	4	8
1112	1	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion I belive that computers have helped our society a lot over the past decade or so. This is because when you on the computer you get better hand-eye coordination. Also you learn how to type and do other things with a computer that you will need to no how to do if you want to get a decinte job that pays well. Also now on the computer you can go on facebook and other website were you can make friend and chat with other people. So its not only helping your social skills and hand-eye coordination but also you are most likly to get a good job if you no how to type and use a computer. First off, having a computer teaches you to have better hand-eye coordination. This is because when you get a computer having better hand-eye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quick. Secondly, having a computer will teach you better social skills. This is because now alot of people go on facebook and you can make friends and chat with your new ones. Also when its a cold and rainy day you can occupy youself by playing different games and also you can check the news and forecast for tommorrows weather. Lastly, when you learn how to type you have a good shot at getting a good job because you no hot to type and work a computer. This is because when you are looking for a job that pays good you will most likly have to me how to type and operate a computer. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, in my opinion I think computers have helped our society over the years, but other people @MONTH1 think differently. So now lets see what you think.	4	4	8
1119	1	Currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. Some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. However, I tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. People exploit most of their time on comptuers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? Many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism. This is one reason why the @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pair you'll recieve, you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercise. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we @MONTH1 learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our frinds in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1. Our families need help occasionally, but sometime we're not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. In conclusion, computers hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends.	4	5	9
1121	1	In my opinion i think that computers help people. It helps them with imformation that they @MONTH1 need. It can also help learn a lot of things.	1	1	2
1123	1	Many computers that people have they use it everday right? Most of them be on it from the time they get off of work or out of school until it's time for them to go to bed. What I think they should to is find some other activity to do instead of sitting on the computer for six hours and not doing nothing with their life and plus at that when you look at a computer for so long you can mess up you eye sight. Why be on the computer all day when you can go outside and get some fresh aire? Why would you wanna be on the computer when you have family and some friends you could be spending time with and taken care of? You don't want to be lazy and not do nothing for yourself. You wanna be able to go for a walk instead of being cooped up in the house on the computer. Why would you even wanna be on the computer when you could have fun going out to eat or to an place you always have wanted to go your whole entire life? You can't always depend on a computer when you wanna go out and explore something new you have to try it out yourself to really see whats the whole thing about. You don't want to have a boring life now do you? Cause that's what it seems like by you sitting around on the computer everyday looking of a bunch of @NUM1-since you wanna do what you want to do and have fun by doing what you like to do. It's not easy finding a job or planing to go out far away by looking on the computer because you have to click a lot of numbers or pictures to go threw what you wanna get to when you can go and do it yourself by looking for better and other things to do.	3	3	6
1159	1	"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more that @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl. She woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @NUM5 out @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make."	6	6	12
1172	1	More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society, are right. I feel this way because people need to start exercising it more, and interact with family and friends. Also, should enjoy life. Please read on to read in detail, as to why I feel this way. Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more, they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. Also, some of them don't even exercise at all. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much. Those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer. When you fight with people you want to gey away from it so you go back to the computer. It's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time. Lastly, they should enjoy life. See the world through their own eyes. Party with friends and family. Go to college and do something with their lives. They need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers, ipods, or even cellphones. In conclusion, the reasons I feel this why are because people need to exercise more, and interact with family and friends. Also, they need to enjoy life. I hope you understand as to why I feel this way.	3	4	7
1179	1	I believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family. If you are on the computer and one of your friends ask you to go outside you are most likely to say no because the computer is grabing your attention more than going outside. That hurts your health and your relationship with your friend. If your family is going to a movie to have family time maybe you will stay because you would stay home on the computer. That effects the relationship with your family. Most people rather stay on the computer than spend time working out. So that effects your health because most of the time your on the computer for a long time your going to end up hungry and keep eating and eating and since your not working out you get fat. Now your not working out and you just keep eating. So since you are not working out and your mind is always on the computer you can get sick. Thats why most people are not healthy because of computers. Computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes your friend can ask you to go outside or to work out and you say no because your on the computer that messes up your relationship with your friend. Or your family can be having a movie night and your on the computer while they leave. That is messing up the relationship with your family. Being on the computer you can go nights without sleeping. I your playing a realy good game on the computer and it comes time for you to take a rest and since the game is so fun you don't sleep. Then after a while you get addicted and won't stop playing. So you won't get sleep and if you have school you won't be able to concentrate you will to busy worried about the game. So thats why computer aren't so good. It can mess up your health. I can mess up your social life with family and friends. You won't get a lot of sleep and won't be able to concentrate.	4	4	8
1191	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you think that children spend to much time on the computer. The issue that is going around is @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books @CAPS2 the same thing. I know alot of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more to on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk it was said that, ""In @LOCATION1 people are alot over wieght"", and it was also said that the number of over wieght people in the world was the of @LOCATION2"". So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye. You could be out side learning hand eye coordination. Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around haveing fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're finsh the start playing games or the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can @CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your disicion. @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exerciseing the they @CAPS2 on the computer. Now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know. "	4	4	8
1200	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has been brought to my attention that why on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside. The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers, rather than enjoying the day. Computers are negatively affecting the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutley crazy if nothing is done about this. For one the @LOCATION1 has the most obese children in the world. Generally children should be running around burning off their calories; even some people in their teen years should. Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such. Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day. The whole screen thing brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain, what computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child ceizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer, with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that everytime you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk. The longer youre on the more and more and more radiation is going to youre brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself, it could almost be called suicide because if youre reading this than you've been warned. So we've basically covered the effects that computers have on your body physically. The computer can also effect you mentally and socially. When @DATE1 comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose @PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school. Its been proven that computers cause memory loss. So what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on, frustrating isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could've gained knowledge rather than using it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer, would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. Its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you.	5	4	9
1205	1	"Dear Newspaper editor, Have you ever been working on a paper, or reading something and theres that word you've never heard before? And you just cant figure it at? There where a computer can help you. Yes, some people do waste all their time, online but they have issues. Computers help us with all of our school projects and get research. You can @CAPS3 reconnect woth old friends that you havent sen in years, learned many good things with the internet and computers. First off we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers. @CAPS1 us school projects, I use @ORGANIZATION1 word and powerpoint all the time. Our teachers prefer us to do that instead of handwriting evert thing. Getting information on the computer is so much faster and easier I mean the time it would take, you to look up the word ""elephants"" the encyclopedia is probably @NUM1 times more that it takes to it in can google. Plus there about @NUM2 1/@NUM2 seconds google call all up millions of websites just what ""elephants"". Another reason way computers are very beneficial is you can reconnect the old friends you havent seen or talked for a years. You can @CAPS3 meet new @CAPS1 us dating and facebook especially is three things and theres websites like twitter where you can follow celebrities and @CAPS2, computers are internet gives great information people. Some kids take online @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that does recieves around computers to do really have a choice. So in conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to lets of people I know its not a good thing to sit there all day and play cmputer games, but we lets of things accomplished, like school projects, or any project really. Its @CAPS3 nice to meet up with someone you havent talked to in a while sometimes. We have learned many great things from the internet. I hopre you consider my opinion."	4	4	8
1244	1	Deear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a @CAPS1 thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what person are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a @CAPS1 effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. They just sit there playing games also about @PERCENT1 of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are probally pating well their on the computer which that is why some people @MONTH1 be fat. Most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @NUM1's and @NUM2's some are in there @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Just sitting there on the computer will get you. Where in life. It will not give you a job or school education. By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side. If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. Being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college, kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends you could get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours, the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eles. Well all of the kids grade through @NUM7 grade should go out a play with their toys and people @NUM8 grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like I sometimes go on facebook. Other people go on facebook, google, games looking up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is youtube and listen to music and watch veidos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people shoud be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and probally will get to fat. So the effect of computers on people is @CAPS1.	4	4	8
1247	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, ect. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloose you to draw or biuld. I bet the even help young children became smarter by biulding things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad econimy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and bretheing you can find broken bones or tomors, you can biuld briges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most importen and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camra for or save a life by fing were they crased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter.	4	4	8
1268	1	People use computers everyday. There's so many reasons way the're always on. They could be talking to one of their family relatives. Also they're probally looking for jobs. There's many things and people shouldn't tell them what to do with their lives. Many people in @LOCATION1 use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things. Also they could be talking to one of their family relatives. There's a thing called webcam and people in @LOCATION1 use it so they could see one another. Buisnesses people are always on the computer because they need to print out documents and they probally got to send something to another country. Buisnesses people also do lots of work on the computer. They can still exercise in @TIME1 for a quick jog, but also thats their choice if they want to stay health or not, plus they're busy people. Other hand people who go on the computer and who are not buisness people or they're not talking to family member or an old friend are students and parents. Tons of students in @LOCATION1 have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information. Parents on the other hand also help out their children and they also talk to their relatives or these looking for a new home or job. If all those people are busy let them do their work they want for need to do. Once their done they could excerise but if they don't want to and other people told them to go not take a walk or anything healthy then it's their lost. We can't some them too. They're just getting better everyday and it's not effecting us. its effecting them. If they want to be on the computer they're also getting bad eye-sight because of too much light.	4	4	8
1289	1	The effect people shouldn't be on the computers that much because you need exercising to keep you healthy. You wouldn't be learn anything if you play games on it all day. Your brain will be fousing on the computers than school. You would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this. It will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers. The effect on people on the computer by not knowing technology is some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain instead of a computers have information in your brain if you are smart. Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard technology and country some of them don't even have technology or electrion because they can't afford for a computers. The effect that they don't know technology is they can find location and no cellphone you can call your friend go online and listen to music, play games chat to friend and family. Play games with each other. And watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on. Click on intert explorer and search on a website to go on it's kind of hard to use the keyboard and typing it fast. The last effect is talking to people that you don't know form online. Is playing the game with a diffrent player you can chat with that person. Conulison this is all my reason why I agree with the effect of a computer have postive reason for a lot of people. This is why I agree with the effect of the computer.	4	3	7
1324	1	Dear local Newspaper, I think people using a computer has a effect. using a computer can help people in many ways. You can talk to people world wide, it helps you stay organized, and you can create very useful things like a or a power point using a computer. Talking to people world wide can be a very useful thing. Say that you have family members that live in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 you can keep in touch with them by e-mail or video chat. Also, if there is a national and nedds to talk to the other, governers around the world for advices help he can do that quickly and easily. Using a computer can also help you stay organized. For example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the light places. Imagine all of the papers and space he would use if he had to do by hand or didnt use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e-mail parents, and even create test or quizes and they know it will be nice and organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desk. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make alot of other things like power points. Power points can help them put alot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising. Lastily, you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday for alot of different people. Talking to worldwide can help you stay in, so you dont lose connection with your. They also have effect they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typeing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them?	4	4	8
1340	1	Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers.	4	4	8
1352	1	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years, the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising, and enjoying nature. Is this good or bad? Technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park. Computers do have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage exercise, advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature, and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world. Firstly, computers are full of great advertisements. Some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising. Studys show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, whereas only @PERCENT1 of kids with computers do not get enough exercise. These statistics show that computers are better for people's health than they are thought to be. Next, computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world. By doing this, people's intellegence will increase because they will learn new facts about new places. Also, people will be happier because they enjoy travel. Lastly, people's jobs will benefit it they're business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet. Finally, the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer. Social sites such as facebook alow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled. Webcams allow people to talk face to face up close about the new gym they joined. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people say they have a better social life online then out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise, encourage travel, and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world. Technology is there to make the world a happier , healthier, and more social place. That is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world.	4	4	8
1354	1	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive affect on society. I believe computers have a positive affect because they help us learn of faraway places, they help us communicate with friends and family all over the world, and computers help entertain people. The computer has a positive affect on society because on it you can learn of faraway places, their history, and you can learn of their landscape. By learning these things you can do a lot of things such as plan a vacation, this information can help you on a school report, also this information can help you learn of your heiratage & your culture. Also computers have a positive effect and are beneficial to society because they help you communicate with friends and family all over the world! You can communicate with anyone you know. Nowadays everyone uses the computer as their main form of communication. In a study it showed that @PERCENT1 of people in the world has a computer as a communication tool. Lastly computers are beneficial to society because they entertain us. On a computer you can do many things to never get bored. You can play games, surf the web, or you can watch videos on networks such as youtube. So on a computer you'll never be bored. The computer is beneficial and has a positive affect on society. The computer helps us learn of faraway places, it lets us communicate with friends and family all over the globe, and lastly the computer entertain us. Thats why the computer is beneficial to society.	4	4	8
1373	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers are benefitial to society even though some people don't because they give us a means of communication, computers give us the ability to learn about forein people or places, and computers help businesses in so many ways. Computers are a most have in a society. Computers give us a means of communication such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6-mail, and so much more. Without the computer, families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button. @CAPS5 lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night. Long distance calls cost money and it is not worth @MONEY1 a call if you call every couple of days. Communication has evolved so much in the past @NUM1 years. Computers are just the bigginning. That is why computers are benefitial to communication. Computers give us the ability to look up facts about forein places and people in a matter of minutes. We could look up who was the @CAPS7 of @LOCATION1 in the would get multiple sites on the @CAPS7. Computers help us expand our learning capabilities and give us a chance to learn things that normally we wouldn't. That is another reason why computers are very benefitial to the society. The last reason that supports the fact the computers are benefitial to the society is because computers help keep much of data. Work data and they help @PERCENT1 of businesses we file reports communicate with other branches of that company. I learned in class that in the job were much more difficult than they are today because of technology. Some people think that using computers deprives people of going out and exercising. It only takes @NUM2 minutes ti check your @CAPS6-mail, or look up something. Computers are benefitial to society because without computers, our lives would be much more complicated.	4	4	8
1411	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about computers? I know that I think they are a great to we are lucky to have them. They have to be used in moderation though, because exercise and staying healthy is good. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help pursude readers on my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers, is that it is a great source to learn. The internet can connect all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures. You can know everything about that country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about you family's history. Many record keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to @LOCATION1 they had data bases there that had every name of the people that went through there. Studies show that @NUM1 people find the internet easy to use, and quicker than any method. Another thing about computers is they help you in the work place. Lets say you had a job designing houses to be built. In old times you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you could make the design using just one tool, the computer. It is a much away way to to you job and if assists the customers because before if the wanted the house to be a different you would have help to draw it all over again. Now you just have to make an ajustment on the computer and in seconds its done with the new design. These day if not @PERCENT2 then @PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play in a social role. On the internet you can connect and chat with friends. Also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting with a soccerball. Experts did a study and it showed that @NUM2 times the reason a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer) what do you think the number one reaso teen use computers teen use computers is?"" @CAPS3, I would have to say to chat with friends. I dont see why they wouldn't, it's simple and almost in ."" Computers are, a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life, life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be over used though and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that. To me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer source found @PERCENT3 of in @LOCATION2, and. I believe they will be in all of our homes. Some families find them @CAPS2 useful the have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs, and can connect you to anything in the world."	5	6	11
1422	1	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is your opinion on computers? Are they good or bad? Computers, have not been around that long but it is contrivertal wiether it has a positive or negative effect. True they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous. I believe computer are not a neccesity to people. Computers are uneeded because people spend way to much time on them, then we begin lack exercise, and they become hazardous to everyone. First, computers are not a neccesity because people send way to much time on them. Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour -and-a-half the computer will start to effect you in negative ways. For one your eyes will begin to hurt. If you stay on longer than that you will start to get a head-ach. Soon your head-ach wil turn so bad you cant bare it. It will pound and feel as if its on fire. This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and @CAPS2 your reading or seeing at the same time. Most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest. Sometimes you don't get off till they have a stomach-ach too. After they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process. This is why, computer are an obstruction to us. Next, people begin to lose exercise. After being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computer have deprived everyone of the outside. They don't want to go out and get exercise and play around. Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing, obysity. Soon you will become fat. Life will become tough. And being fat also has a negative effect. For one you cannot run very long, you become weak, and for kids you stop growing. But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So you see computers are a nucence to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the envirnment. There are @NUM1 billion people in the world. At anytime about @NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan. Now, have you ever thought were this heat goes. Well, it makes holes in the ozon layer and causes global warning. The ozon layer is the only thing keeping the sun's ultra-violent rays from scorting us. Now if everytime some turns on a computer @NUM3 of the ozon layer disapeared and @NUM2 billion people are on that would be @NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere. Now think about global warming. If the ozon layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the @CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise. The @CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth. Do you reall want that. Eventually we would drown and life would seece to exist. As you can see computer are a nucents. They hypnotize the young children and adults. They be helpful but more hazardous. Sometimes we don't even relize this. Computers are bad because people spent to much time on them, people lose exercise, and they are hazardous to us.	3	5	8
1429	1	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can. In conclusion is a very useful thing. talk to your relatives from @LOCATION2 and you can shopping without the waiting in line. The can talk to other the world.	3	4	7
1445	1	Introduction @CAPS1 cingle computer in the world should have internet. Internet helps people in meany ways. Ancybody can do there homework on a computer. You can even talk to your friends on a computer send emails to anybody around the world or just play coms. Teacher use computers because its the easyest to find information that they might need. Students can use a computer to do a research paper for lets say history. You can find anything about anybody or anything on a computer that has internet on it. Theres also a cool thing that is found on some computers its called microsoft word. It lets you right anything you want and if you mess up a word you can fix it if you wanted to. Some school-s actuly suply there students with there one partiple computer. They can do there homework when evertime want and just send an emal to there teacher that homework on it. Computer have @MONTH1 mark information then any book in the world. Because computers have way more storage for more information. Also the cool thing about a computer is that there are websites that let you talk to your friends that live near you. But you dont have to actuly co to there houses you can put pictures or you on facebook or myspace or any other site. You also can play games on facebook, myspace or any thing els. Schools should use computers because its the best way to get the information that you need to do something. Like science, math, or history homework. Or even just for fun or to learn something new that you never knew before. You should agree with me because everything I rote down was true and almost the best wat to get pictures or any information. That you need to do something. Or even just to talk to a friend that you havent seen in awile.	4	4	8
1452	1	"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community."	6	6	12
1453	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have recently saw that you think that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of excercising or hanging with their friends and family. Well I think the opposite of that opinion. People interact with people online if the want to. People can also learn new things. Plus computers help people make money. So read on to hear more. Most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow. @PERCENT1 of all people have either a facebook, a myspace, a skype, or all three. on any of those sites you interact with people. We can meet new people on the internet. Like people on the other side of the state or country. Also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town. Like for instance if there was a missing child we know the description, so we could help find him or her. Not only do people interact bu people can research useful information. For an example, one day I was told do a project on teen mothers. I went straight to the library I took some books out and whatever I couldn't find in the books. I went to the computer for. Also we can learn about faraway places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. My mom always says, ""@CAPS1 your room or @CAPS2 going to give your stuff to people in need."" @CAPS3 the first time she said that to me I went to the computer to see how other people were having to me. Some were good, nice, big houses but tyen others lived in boxes and trash cans. That changed me big time, I felt really had for those people. Lastly computers help people make money and support their family. @PERCENT2 of all people found out about their job on a computer. Theycan go to websites to find good safe jobs that makes good money. Plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home. Some people dont have the money for babysitters so have to watch their kids all day so have to work from home to make money. Finally people can apply for jobs or even community service online. My sister, @PERSON1, got her first job by going on the @CAPS4 museums website and applying right there on the computer. Therefore computers are good. I say this because people can interact with other people online, people can research useful information, and finally computers help people find jobs and make money. Do you use computers for any of these reasons?"	4	5	9
1456	1	"How would you like to got a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after-school? What if you were bored to death, and you couldn't watch t.v. or play games? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer: you can watch videos and play games, you can chat and talk to people, and you can even boost up your grade. I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @CAPS2, let's look at how a computer can change your life. Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. You are going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser. I remember @TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1 and @DATE1 I found out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we talked about how that @CAPS7 posibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school. For example, how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can do. If you got bad grades (without computer), you will go to a bad college and have a bad job, however, if you got good grades(with computer), you will go to a good college and get a good job. Next, let's look at how you can chat or talk to people. You can have a mesaging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers. You can also communicate with people who has an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them. So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public. Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together. A computer can really the of your life. Lastly, let's look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored. Why you go youtube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting? ""@CAPS10, I was done with homework and I didnt know what to do, so i online and spend only watching youtube videos, sometimes people like playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing tetris, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight's before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, can entertain you as well. As you can see, saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely non-sense. Computers can and make you. I honestly never seen someone on the computer for."	5	5	10
1462	1	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a world where the uneployment rate rises sinificgently, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just discapeared. I think computers are more benefical to society then some people relize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an acountend. Computer games and @CAPS2 help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teen how to become sucessful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now acess grades in a heartbeat. My computer helps me.	4	3	7
1473	1	Dear local news paper, This paper is going to be about the reason computers are bad. Frist, computers are bad cause people wouldn't have time to enjoy the nature when its nice and warm out. Second reason is cause they won't spend time with there familys at all or there friends and the only time they would get off the computer is to pay the bill and buy a game for the computer. The third reason is that how are going to get a job cause they wouldn't want to get up to look for a job cause there having to much fun intill they cut off the light then he would do dum things to pay is bell se he can start to play again and thats going to make hin do it over and over again. That's why it's bad to have a computer. But now where is people going go in life cause some people love to play games on the computer and some don't that's why some computers are bad for some people. And this is just my opinion there's alot more people might think so to. And thank you for having time to read this.	3	3	6
1489	1	Dear local newspaper, In my opinion I feel like to many people spend to much time on the @ORGANIZATION1. People are getting obeast because there not getting enoff exersoce. Children are going on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of doing there homework. Maybe perhaps a fmaily member is dieing and you rather spend time on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of with that family member. all of this things are happening because of the computers everyone is getting. This can not be true! That over @PERCENT1 of the people inNew @CAPS1 say that they are putting on a lot of waight and turning obeast. I asked them what do they think is this to happen. Someone named @PERSON1 said the reason is the computers there taking over people lifes. The computers is the enomy of the people that it is a affecting most in life. Me as a child a @ORGANIZATION1 is throwing me off of my homework. I use to have A's and b's on my report card only. Right now it turned in to @CAPS2 and @ORGANIZATION1's are changing my life drastikly but not in a good way. As you know it your child could be going threw, the same terible things as me. You should start to check there homework instead of them just going on there @ORGANIZATION1 and forgetting all about there work life I did. Try and provent this. running down your face and feeling disaponted in your self. The one you love good past u way and you did not even spend time with he or she. Wanse again the thing that is called @ORGANIZATION1 did this. The disigen that you made because of the @ORGANIZATION1 would and is going to scare you for life. We the people that have computers would find out that they were never made for a good purpose just to distray what we do and how we spend times with are familys and friends. Turn your head and say no to the one thing that would reck you into little peases. How do you feel? I feel bad because I let something so little mess up my life. You still have time to change your life and say no to the computers. They could make you turn obeast because you are not getting enoff exersice. The one you love could be messing up because of the @ORGANIZATION1 that you have in your house. The worst thing of all you were not able to spend time with the family member that you love the most. The computers that we have are missing your life us you no it up. Just say no to the computers and live your life the best way that you could. Don't you feel bad that you let something so little ruen your live!?!	5	4	9
1502	1	Dear local newspaper, I believe that with too much use of computer it will have bad affects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also use a lot of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad affects computers have, but their not all bad, without them life might be a little harder. Playing computer games, and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them everyday. Online poker could be dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in debt. Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop. It's a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addicting too. There's a website that called addicting. I guess people don't know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 goes to computer? Thats almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic chrisis I don't think enery should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people any need. If everyone didn't need computers to communicate and everything there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. I understand emailing, and facebook. But don't get out of hand with it. Isnt being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or excercise rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not excercising. I remember when I was younger, everytime I went to my friends house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most @CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I would define they rather excersise or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer it can have bad affects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family?	6	4	10
1508	1	Computers. Theres fun. But there's also a down side. People spent more time on it than outside or exersizing or even getting together with friends and family. But on ther hand, they're also fun, help kids, and even help get together from dating sites. It makes them happy. It's fun! Computers are fun. They provide a wide arrow of games, educational can just plain fun. You can play role playing games (which and fun because I play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on islands, or other downlodabal education games that are, @CAPS1 not fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child. They also can help kids learn how to and other things at a very early age. Some very adults have and various other things that I cannot the life of me think of @CAPS2 thing computer get them together and they are happy. They do this hundreds of a day. Take away computers and people will die alone and sad. so in conclusion my ideas where! fun help kids and help older people get together. Read this and @CAPS3 sure you'll see it my way.	4	4	8
1511	1	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer has been a resource we have been using for years and gives you information and pictures but that doesn't mean people have to be on it all the time. People can talk some times with other people or go on the webcam to see a loved one who's in iraq but the need to go outside to exercise just to take a walk around the block. They don't even need to leave the house all the time just excercise to a tape or get a tredmill. Thats all people need to do instead sitting on thier butts all day move around. People becoming obease has risen because of lack of excercise so grab your shoes and go jog a couple blocks in your niehbor hood just do little things and you will feel much better than you were on your computer. Nature is all around us but most people don't noice because their on the computers. Which needs to end now these beautiful land marks across the world are being wasted because hardly any ones looking at them. Go to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, even @CAPS1 and get some fresh clean air thats not from your home you can go to the park to just look at the birds just see something without a screen on it. So go got your camera and go some where with wild life and have fun. Just doing these things will help your health, energy and your mind. You can go on the computer and chat with friends but not all the time. Do you want to be unhealthy in life if not go outside and take a walk.	4	3	7
1530	1	To: @ORGANIZATION1 goes so fast, and the most they make more new invations. They had invented a computer which it helps people in the work they have to do, however there is a big problem, is that people are spending too much in the computer specialy teenagers. I suggest that is a horrible idea, because they are less time being active, also less time intracting with friends and family and @CAPS1 it is dangerous for teenagers. However many people @MONTH1 not ogrea with me. There is so many teenagers and adults that are just wasting time in the computer, instead of playing outside enjoying the nature, doing exercise and just having fun. Don't you think is a great idea. Well a friend of mine used to go outside everyday went outside to play. I think . Which I really miss her. You know when you go spent time with your family. But guess what they are in the computer, wasting time instead of spending time with your family. Do you think thats good? Well is not because thats how the family gather and stop coming to visit you. That's just so sad had family seperate. That's not all because do you think that people will be in dangerous problems, well they are. Do you know how you get a myspace and you meat a boy that says that is the name age as you and tells you if he could meet you and you say yes and lets say you were @NUM1 year old girl, he is like @NUM2 years old. He will abuse of you or kill you. You thought he was @NUM1 years old but he was not. I think is dangerous for kids. I think is a horrible idea of having computers, because you will be less time spending nature, also less time spending with your family and getting into dangerous things. However people @MONTH1 not agree with me, but what if your child was in dangerous. How would you feel? People should really think about having computers.	4	4	8
1544	1	I People spend too much time on the computer. A lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day. They should be spending time with family and friends. People never have enough time for activities. Also computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends, homework,research, games @CAPS1 bored, and work. To begin with, people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than on the computer. For example @CAPS1 your mother or father asked you @CAPS1 you wanted to go out to dinner and you said no, I'm on the computer, that would just mean your obsessed with going on the computer. A lot of families are bing broken apart because people spend too much time on the computer @CAPS1 you have a friend over and they say I am bored and all you are doing is play games on the computer than that is just being rude because your friend is bored. So you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones. Previously I stated how people spend time with loved ones, well people need to spend more time doing activities as well. A lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat. @CAPS1 you are gaining weight because your on the computer than you need to go do some activite to off that fat. @CAPS1 you are a teen and you are given the idea to play a sport and you it because computer is more important then is some serious obesession with the computer. As a result, the computer should be used wisely. The computer should be used to talk to family and friends, homework, research, work, and @CAPS1 you bored play some games little games on the computer. Those are probably the most important things that should most likely used for the computer. A lot of these things that I have listed are important because @CAPS1 you go on the computer just to be on and watch people talk then what's the point of wasting your time on the computer when you could be doing much more different things on the computer. For example, @CAPS1 you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions you can go to www.dictionary.com to find them, or @CAPS1 you just need to define a simple word. In conclusion, people spend too much time on the computer. They need to be spending more time with family and friends. Also people need to be doing more activities in their lives. Lastly, you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research. So, as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things.	5	5	10
1551	1	"Dear local newspaper- I understand that computers are becoming more of a ""must have"" in peoples everyday life. I believe this is a great thing! If you're on the computer you type which helps improve peoples hand-eye coordination. Also, you can learn more about people, places, cultures and much more. Lastly, you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people. To begin, I think having computers is a good idea because it helps people improve on their handeye coordination. My cousin @PERSON3, who is a big time baseball player, used to have trouble catching the when he was younger. He kept trying over and over again and never gave up. Then, for his birthday his parents bought him a computer! He was so excited, but when it came to typing papers, he wasn't the best. Not only did he practice baseball but also typing. His family realized that buying him that computer was of the best ideas. It improved his baseball career (by throwing and catching the ball) and increased his grades in school. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one that has gained hand eye coordination from computers. A recent study from yale college shows that @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer for atleast a month gains some sort of hand eye coordination. @PERSON1, a teacher of the computer class at high school states, ""@CAPS1 freshman that I get in my class tells me that computers have made their sports careers easier because they now have better hand eye coordination."" Computers have two things in one, you learn to type and help your hand eye coordination. Do you want you @CAPS3 to be lacking that positive ability in life? In addition, computers help you learn more about people, places and cultures. I heard a couple nights ago that @ORGANIZATION2 had an earthquake. I also learned about the powerplant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. How do I know all of this you ask? The front page on @CAPS2.com! But, i'm not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet, so many more have too. @ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @CAPS3 use the computer to do research and @PERCENT2 answered that they did. Does the society really want to take away @CAPS3 knowledge of whats going on around us and our history? In conclusion, people can communicate with friends and relatives. This is great if you haven't seen them recently, or if you want to just stay in touch. For example, @PERSON4, mycousin, just found me on facebook. I haven't seen her for eight years abut now I talk to her all the time. We talk about visiting each other and how our family's are doing. But, you can also talk to your friends too. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 between the ages of eleven and eighteen talk to their friends over facebook on a daily basis. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, says ""I think this is a great idea for @CAPS3 to communicate with other @CAPS3 through the computer. It gives them the chance to interact in a different way."" @CAPS3 have such a good lifestyle for them, do you want to feel guilty for ruining that? Finally, people have perfect opportunities right in front of them. Computers help improve hand eye coordination and helps you learn. It also lets people interact with others in a different way. Do you think that these golden ideas are bad for our society?"	4	5	9
1558	1	@PERCENT1 of all people in the @LOCATION3 have computers. This number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer. It help us communicate better get imformation quicker and entertain us. Computer have a very positive effect on us. With the invention of the computer, more and more people can communicate quicker and eaisier. For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, @CAPS1 you have relatives who live across the country, you could use webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world. You can learn alot more about other countries culture and other cities way of life. Finally, @CAPS1 a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, the relationship just gets better. The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet you can findout how tall a maple tree is or , how to lose weight. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities nature walks and new and exciting excersises. When students need information on a school project, they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it. When the computer came, people could plaly games, watch @CAPS2.V. and movies, and do business. @CAPS1 you missed you favorite @CAPS2.V. Show you can go online and watch them. @CAPS1 you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, e-mail comes into place, and you mail will never be slow. And finally, you can play many, many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination. With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. Theres information quicker, communication better, and entertainment better. All of the search were in a very good world.	4	4	8
1562	1	The importance of computers in the modern world. Computers now and days are popular thecnology now and days computer are a bigger calculator. The invension of the computers were a very short cauculator. It's like a mother begin in your house. Lot of people have different of computers are more improve more faster and more high quality. The computer are now and days are improving their technology, every day there a billions buying computer across the whole world but that does not mean that there the best quality but the people are fighting for better modern inversions.	2	2	4
1563	1	Computers, one of the daily things we use and @CAPS1 with. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers! I love computers but, I as a teen know about managing your time on the computer. You cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer. The amount of time wasted on your computer could be the time you might be outside haveing fun. Theres lots of things you could do outside! As for some exsamples: @CAPS1 come ball, run around, go to the park, go exploring etc... Friends and family are very entertaining, I have lots of friends and I love them all! If you have some spare time you should hang out with them and have some fun, go to the mall! I always go to the mall with my friends insted of playing on the computer for hours on end. So get of the computer and go @CAPS1! Have some fan in the sun today.	3	3	6
1575	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people. Since I have two computers and one laptop I have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer. Everyone should have computers, because you can look up different things, you can play games like checkers with the computer or against somebody else, and the last reason @CAPS1 that you can chat with people from different states and even countries, because I know everybody likes to talk to one another. Everyone should have computers, because you can search different things. You can search places and people. Basically, you can search anything on the internet @CAPS3 you are on the right website. One time I wanted to go on the web and look to see @CAPS3 there was a in @LOCATION1. I went to ask.com and typed in ""@CAPS1 there a in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1? It said yes, and then it showed me a @CAPS2 of information about. It told me the address the phone number and the name of the manager. Looking up places in sometimes. Everyone should have a because you can play any types of game. You could play internet game checkers, solitaire and even freecall. @CAPS3 you don't any types of games you can always go on gaming just games up there. Since I use the computer everyday onto all. When I was six years old we a driving game. Since I did not the website all I got to play was checkers on the computers but one day logged onto it and played my first driving computer game. Everyone should have a computer, because you can chat with people. Instead of always using your phone calling and texting people raising your phone bill, why not use your computer and chat all you want without wasting minutes on your cell phone. I know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone. Instead of doing that just go on the internet find a chatcom and start chatting or bloging with your friends. One time I ran out of minutes on my phone and I didn't have internet. I asked my dad @CAPS3 I could use the computer. He said yeah, so I went to a local chatroom on the internet. My friend had an acount there so it would be easy for us to talk all we wanted. I joined in and we chatted until @TIME1. In conclusion I think everyone that likes to look up places, play games, and chat should have a computer."	4	5	9
1578	1	Dear, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I think that although computers are very helpful to socity. Thire also paseing a problem to it for example people are out there that adicted to computers and will in a dark area for hours just on the computer also its not helping the fact that there obessity in @LOCATION2 I explain that to you but any ways this thing that teaching are youth could very much hurt them. Computer junkies what are they? A computer junkie is someone who woke up in the morning at @TIME1 and and stay on it for a good past @NUM1 hours this is a problem that @PERCENT1 of are @CAPS1 youth have topic @MONTH1 be not be big to but it is a problem must know my brothers addict to his laptop he spends hours in his bedroom watching anime japanise cartoons and not eating anything the whole day. Never leaves his room and my mom get so tired of trying to drag him out of his room she just quit and it gets annoying after a while a little computer isnt bad but alot is. Obeasity is a growing problem in are nation and computers arent helping infact computers are making matters worse by having items being shiped to them of in extent of the obesse person getting up used and leaving of they could lose a little wieght and now you can order offline and have it deliverd to your door @CAPS2 @CAPS3 market such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5 domino @CAPS4 and @LOCATION3 jade have been a part of this issue stop online @CAPS3 ordering. The computer is a great way to learn about things but it also a great way to become a junkie and fat:	4	5	9
1594	1	Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have an bad effect on people. I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up. I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adult to. That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effects is just helpful ness.	4	4	8
1596	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive effect on people. Spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so important that have throuhout school teaching us how to type. we also use hand-eye coordination is loaded and. You have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the. Computers are helpful in many ways. Have you ever about what looks like or what would be found on it? With a computer you can. Comuputers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get pictures some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who lies there. Yes, you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life easier. Computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. They give you the oppurtunity to talk with people online whether the world the street. In order to do this you need a web. They are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. Its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country. Its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spanding to much time an computer and not on exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. All of these things should be. All you have to do is manage your time. Or not all day on the computer. If you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created. I would like to thanks all f the reader for there time and hope hat you all support me and my ideas.	4	5	9
1603	1	To the local Newspaper, I think using computers does not have a negative effect on people. I believe it's an advantage to use it. You are given technology, advantage so why not use it? They give people chance to chat with people allow them to make friends. These days people even watch to shows on the computer-websites such as: @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 allows them to search anything and watch it on @CAPS1. People make emails, download music and several other things. Children at the age of @NUM1, @NUM2 even @NUM3 move use computers-play games on them. i have a cousin who is @NUM3 and he plays games on it all the time he even knows how to search something on the computer. Some people @MONTH1 think it gives you a negative effect, but really it doesn't. Those people think that should comee to the reality. We have to step up as the life goes. Let's say a girl doesn't have a computer, her parents think that computers spoil children, their technology spoil children. The girl goes to school, her friends asks her to give them her e-mail. Every time her friends asks her about email she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject. this time she made an excuse, but how many times is she going to make up an excuse. Then suppose one day her friends finds out she doesn't have a computer and embarasses her in front of everyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that you have to see around you and go on with it computer also saves your time. You can just type instead of writing whole out. You can make your writing cursive or any other that you would like. After reeding my letter, I hope you understand my point. Next time you see a person who thinks computers give negative effects to people, tell the advantages of the computers and how it benefits society around you.	4	4	8
1605	1	Dear local newspaper, I think the effects of computers are good. Some reasons I think this is that we get a lot of knowledge from it, contact people you dont live near and haven't seen in a while. My first reason why I think the effects of computers are good because you can get a lot of knowledge from it. One example would be if you want to make a @CAPS1 meal, you wouldn't find it in an ordinary @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you would have to look up on the internet for the recipe. Another example is if you wanted to travel to @LOCATION1 by car and you didn't have a map how would you get the directions? You would go on the computer, look up directions to @LOCATION1 and print it out. You would have never been able to go to @LOCATION1 if you didn't have a map or a computer. My second reason why I think the effects of computers is good is because you can contact friends or family that you have not seen in a while. One example would be if your sister just graduated from college and you wanted to congratulate her but you were @NUM1 feet in the air by a airplane and all you had was your laptop and your luggage, you would e-mail her saying good job. These are just a few reasons why I think the effects of computers is good, and I hope the local newspaper agrees too.	4	4	8
1644	1	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe computers can be bad for society. My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers, less time exercising, and lose interacting with family and friends. My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them. I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. Ive been over a friends house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. Alot of @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. Ive seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It's just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends ive spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think ""hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or myspce, or facebook! you lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer. Half the time im to busy talking to someone i don't know then helping my little brother with home work, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion these are my three reasons why i think the computer is bad for sivilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think what the computer can do to @CAPS1 I people once again those three resons are one, people are spending to much time on their computer. Two, spend less time exercising. Three, lose interactions with family and friends."	4	4	8
1665	1	Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication.	4	5	9
1673	1	Everyone will agree that using computers is also a good choice because you do meet people you don't know. Also you learn more stuff you don't know. Not only that but, u can also learn more about technology. Most people would say that, meeting people is good because you can have fun talking and getting to know people. Also, people would want to learn about other people cultures. Some people would want to know some personal, buiseness about peopl. Even people want to know where are some people from. People like to kno	2	3	5
1703	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle schoolers growing up, I believe using computers can be beneficial at same point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of innapproprate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to ""hack"" or tresspass someone else's computer. Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download innapropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use. criminal acts, vulgar language and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, apperance, and age. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much ""fun"" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @NUM1 hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be innappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. More and more peole become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my oppinnion."	5	6	11
1705	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. But why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer. I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. Sure enough he was! I got the home work and got an A all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others.	6	6	12
1717	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I want to argue about the issue of computer use in @LOCATION1, @CAPS3, I'll tell you about the benefits of owning a computer. Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town are very good for society. There are the major benefits of using a computer. @CAPS3 is the fact you can use microsoft to write up a paper. Sixth grader @PERSON6 says, ""I would rather type than write a paper. Another reason to use a computer is a for research."" @CAPS4 many articles and facts are online about anything you need,"" says @PERSON4. The final benefit of a computer is the fact you can know about world news in a flash. ""I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage,"" says @PERSON5. Those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer. Now lets talk about something. That is said to be bad but really isnt; social networking. Stuff like @CAPS5 use a texting form on a computer which helps us connect without making a huge phone bill: with instant messanger I can talk to @CAPS2 girlfriends,"" says @PERSON2. Also, there is facebook which can help us connect on a global stage. ""I can talk with @CAPS2 cousin in @LOCATION2,"" says @CAPS6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. @CAPS3, we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. ""I can use @CAPS2 computer anywhere I like,"" says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eigth grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" The final major advance is the use of the printer,"" I use @CAPS2 printer to print of papers to bring to school,"" @PERSON3 said. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. There is many benefits to owning a computer. We talk to people world-wide when ever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology. @CAPS4 please help defend us kids in this case about computer use."	4	4	8
1719	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 about what the world would be like without computers. Scary thought? I had the same reaction. A world without computers is a world of non-communicating people and no where to gather information independently. The benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that don't live in your area or that you just haven't talked to in a while. They also teach hand-eye coordination which is good for almost anything. Lastly, they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world. In conclusion, computers have outstanding effects on people. First of all, in my perspective, having a computer, allows me to communicate to people I've met on past vacations. I can email, them and talk to them on social networks such as facebook. This is benefical to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family. Being able to talk to friends I haven't spoken to in a white, gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect. In conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer, is only I, of the many benefits a computer has! Second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand-eye coordination as well. Dereck was a channel @NUM1 news reporter, ""I can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. I truely @CAPS1 it's because my mother teached me now to use a computer! ""@CAPS2 especially benefit from computers because they teach them hand-eye coordination which is great for those homeruns, or even touchdowns! Third of all computers allow students and many others to learn and look up things they don't know. @PERCENT1 of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research. On the other hand, businessman, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. Overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand-eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. As a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and a success for realiable information!"	4	4	8
1722	1	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people are talking about computers and what it does to us. People believe that using the computer is a waste of time. I believe that computers aren't a bad thing. Using the computers can help us learn about other places in the world. It can also show us the lives about people from the past. We can also talk to our friends online. If you want to know why computers are useful, just keep on reading. People say that computers waste our lives. I disagree with that opinion. The internet is a great way to learn about different places in the world. We can learn about the climate. The animals, and the food they eat. @CAPS1 palces have different types of culture. For example, in @LOCATION3 everyone eats seafood. In @LOCATION2, everyone eats spicy food. The internet can show us pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before. It's a great way to see and learn about different places compared to how you live. Do you have a friend that you haven't seen in a long time? Would you like to be in contact with that person again? Well the internet is a great way to do this. It allows you to make an account such as twitter, facebook, @NUM1 and more. You can search up your friends name and magic! You finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again. You would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again. @CAPS1 kids use the computer in order to do their history projects. Well the internet is here to help. You can search up famous people from the past or people from now adays. The internet allows you to see and learn about these people's past. One example is @LOCATION1. He was the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1. You can learn so much about him like where he was born, how @CAPS1 family relatives did he have and more. So you see, the internet is a great use for kids. These are my reasons in why I believe that computers aren't bad. We still have time for family, friends and any fun outdoor activity. We can learn about different places in the world. We can talk to friends online, and we can learn about people from the past.	4	5	9
1733	1	I think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people and even allow people to talk with other people. My first reason, is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life. The people that use computers have important jobs. For example, a judge, an enginere, a lawyer, an archytecht, a scientist, an archeologist etc... This is why I think that computer are helpfull for people. My second reason, is that computer could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school. It could help develop a smarter brain in many ways. The first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute. It helps by knowing the meaning of new words. I helps you speak correctly and clear. That is why I think that computers help develop a smarter brain. My third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world. That could be a hobby for adults that does not have something to do could have a good time. My conclusion is that with computer you could have a better life. Computers could help you get a better future.	4	4	8
1742	1	To whom it @MONTH1 concern; I am writing this to let you know how I feel about the effects computers have on people. My opinion on this topic is; I think that both statements are true, yes they give people the ability to learn about faraway places & people & also allow people to talk on line with others. If we did not have computers I would not have finfished many of my school process and homeworks. But the experts who are spending too much time on thier computers & less time exercising enjoying nature & interacting with family and friends. I know this is true because I know some peopel who have gotten addicted to online video games & wouldn't leave the computer for hours & I know I myself have found new website & want to learn all about it so I'll be on the computer instead of exercising. But even with both statement being true; I do not think computers efefcet on people. Because without computers alot more students would be failing classes & getting zeros// @CAPS1's on projects; class asignments & homework. Becayse they dont have a quick way to look up all their information. Also most families or friends will lose contact because they lost a fun way to communicate. i think computers have a positive effect. Don't you?	3	3	6
1763	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function @CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload @CAPS8 @CAPS3."" @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, ""@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics."" A lawyer said, ""You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is on @MONEY1 those tools."" @CAPS4, @CAPS8 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper @CAPS8 a @CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, ""Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom."" @CAPS8 internet, citizens @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, @CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way @MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and @CAPS8 online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people each. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 @MONEY1 them said online. ""@CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet @MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!"" said a person interviewed. Airports make @MONEY1 for the @LOCATION2 government, and @CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways @MONEY1 booking transportation. @CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me."	6	6	12
1785	1	My opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.	4	4	8

2984	2	How @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library? I, along with many other students, @CAPS4 find this discouraging and distastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population @MONTH1 be born.     Like the beloved @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I @CAPS4 not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now. All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like @PERSON2 did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity @CAPS4 not only affect this generation, but the futures of all.          If this censorhip was to be allowed, who is to say what all  could be censored? Who @CAPS4 be the final judge as to what books @CAPS4 be banned? It @CAPS4 all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. This struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties. Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe @CAPS4  be wrong. For instance, it @CAPS4 be like an @CAPS1 forcing a @CAPS2 to not believe in @CAPS3; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship @CAPS4 lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing.     Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books @CAPS4 be to censor all individual mentality. Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world @CAPS4 become similiarly vapid and dull. Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality @CAPS4 decrease.     To conclude, censorship @CAPS4 be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. So how @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? Disrespected? That is how I @CAPS4 feel	5	5	5
2996	2	If the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines then yes, they can feel offensive about the @CAPS7 things inside the magazine or books. These people are going to always find something or some rumor to start a big fight about these @CAPS1 things, those people are called '@CAPS2'. They can find A eazy way to get something started just like that, That's why before i buy A magazine, I take A look inside of first And see If @CAPS3 interested in buying that specific certain book, or magazine. If I don't like the things that I see inside of @CAPS5, then I @CAPS4 not buy @CAPS5, @CAPS5's @CAPS1 As that. If they are @CAPS7, they should immediately be removed from the news stands on the streets of @LOCATION1, @LOCATION6, @LOCATION12, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, @LOCATION8, @LOCATION9, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION10, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, Or @CAPS8 @LOCATION11, @LOCATION7.	1	1	1
3029	2	wow thats racist. as i said when i saw the movi white men cant jump. yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly i thought it was funny i enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people. its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that.      everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. but its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you. see now i have a since of humor. when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself. i didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny.     to kill a mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and i can see why. it had the @CAPS1 word in there a lot. but back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. he wasnt offending you.      if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body.     in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on. and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run.	3	3	3
3033	2	Why should we be more carefull of what we get at the libary? Libaries can have books with knowledge, fun, rommance, and action or adventure, but some can be desterbing and grusium. Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornagerfy or grusium action. This causes the kids to act in different ways. They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children. They are sneeky and do things behind the parents back. Why is because they think they need to act this way because its cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly. 'So take them out' is some of the parents are saying now a days.     Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left. Because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind. So why do we need to be more carefull with the books we put in our libary and the books we take out of our libary? It causes the world to change very fast.     Now libarys are a great place for kids to learn. Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge. The libary is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to. Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy. From my point of view libary is one of my most favorites places to be. Any where there are books involved count me there. Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventeres that some of us will never get to do.     Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families. Some of them causes us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior. If we try to take out some of these books it will help the familes to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild. Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world. Which really its just  the books and ect... that causes our mind to picture things that make us think we need them.      Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today. Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander. Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces. I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful. Magazines can help us with research or just to now what is happening in this world today.      They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decerating, on how to decerate your weddings and etc... Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then. Like watching docromentries, they are on people or what happened in our past. We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without.      So why do we need to be more carefull for what we put in libaries? It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams. So how can we help to solve this problem? We can take out  books, magazines, movies and etc... that are really bad for our mind. So it can help our children to grow up well behavied and mature. Also one more thing books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right. How do we know we got a good book? We find right books for us by following our heart and our instinkes	4	4	4
3045	2	Should books, magazines, music, movies, and ect. be censored for certin age levels? No they should'ent. Books can be very educational. Sometimes you can't even find a book with out bad things in them. Even if they do, sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country.     Books can't be censored from children. Why you ask? Because the reason people read books is to learn. To learn about love, math, history, and much more. These books are writen by adults, not for adults, but for everyone to read. I read lots of books, and every book that I read I learn someting new.     Back in the ninetinth and twentith centerys, cursing was huge in books. But it wasent just to curse, it was to show the full dioulge of the character. It also set the mood of the era, and the place, where the story is being held. Such as in war books the characters curse a lot. The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was,' @CAPS1!!' That isn't how the character would act. The man would curse his lungs out. Not literly but when the author writes what someone would truely say, the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book.     As the quote says, everyone has the same right to read, which is true. Its true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in. Right? I myself strongly belive they everyone should choose what they want to learn about, and then have the freedom to do that.     So should books in a library be censored? No defenitly not. its the best way for people to learn what life is really like. Sometimes you can learn anything with out reading a book with curse words, sex, or violance. People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age. But it wont, it will only show them how not to act. And can only create a better person.	4	4	4
3099	2	Twilight, @PERSON1, or even The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series are books that many guardians do not allow their children to read due to their beliefs on what is real and what is not. Magic, spells, and vampires many of us know are not real but others do not believe in what it is that is being taught to the younger readers. My personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. But there would be certain circumstances where I would have to put my foot down and censor things such as sex and drugs just because that is not suitable for young children to be reading at that young of age.     The reason why I would have a low tolerance of the censorship is because different people like different things. If someone was an athelte they might not find a book about cooking and cleaning very appealing. As if a person that was a cook might not find a book about athletics too appealing either. Just because one person has different beliefs or what their standard is for offensive would not change my stand point on the censorship of certain articles. Different beliefs of certain people is understandle but, just because you don't believe it doesn't mean that everyone else is going to right there not believing it with you. Dont't ruin it for the others who enjoy the interesting fact of a male @CAPS1 falling in love with a normal @CAPS3 girl just like you and me.      Another reason why my censorship in libraries is because it would give my library more variety. If there was twenty different @PERSON1 books on the shelves many people would be able to look at them and check them out as they please. Also, if you didn't know what kind of book you wanted to check out, you could look around and get a mystery, drama, comical, or even a horror book. Having a wide range to select from would keep the guests always coming back for more. I know that when my library had a series of books that I found interesting that I was back in there after I finished each one.       Also, having different reading or viewing materials on hand is important in a library do to the fact that some books these days are now turned into films which makes people more eager to finish that book in less then a week so that weekend they can watch the movie. Most people say that the movies are never better then the original book itself but an opinion is easier to be based off of reading the book and then watching the movie not just by stopping after reading the book.      Now that you know my personal views about the censorship in libraries understand that not everyone is the same. That is why when school's talk about getting school uniforms many children are against it due to the fact of wearing whatever style of clothing you do each day show individuality such as which type of book your reading also, shows your individuality. That is why my personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to the fact that different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. Just because you @MONTH1 not believe in the magic or wizardry doesn't mean you have to ruin it for someone else. So don't jusdge a book by it's cover and lets not set a high standard on censorship in libraries.	4	4	4
3113	2	I dont believe books should be takin off of the shelves for being offensive. Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another. People @MONTH1 have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel, but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book. I understand that parents want to protect children. Parents should talk to their children and explain to them why they dont want them reading that specific book. Parents might also just let their children read it and explain why they don't approve.      I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies. When I was twelve years old i started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played. My mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to. She refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it. I went to my friends houses and listed to explicit music and watched rated @CAPS1 movies. She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went.     I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision. I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child. Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away. That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable	3	3	3
3123	2	I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful.     There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarassing. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'.      Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There @MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody @MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman @MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion. What is offensive to some, @MONTH1 not be offensive to others.     I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it @MONTH1 be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world.	4	4	4
3126	2	Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished.     In this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. The will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around. It's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there.     Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship. It @MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener. On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless.        In my experence I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images.     Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things @MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating and music @CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves. The first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world.	4	4	4
3155	2	The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group. Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive.     Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge. They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in.      With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. We cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries	3	3	3
3169	2	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views.     A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightnement. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on @CAPS5 but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? @CAPS1 goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another.      Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inapropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not aloud to roam the library without an adult. @CAPS1 is a very prominant rule because it sets boudaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults.      Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries beacuse they are found offensive becuase @CAPS1 is censorship and it takes away our rights.	3	3	3
3189	2	Books have been apart of every single person's life as soon as they learn to read. First our parents read us books to get us to go to sleep. Then our teachers read us books to teach us things or to keep us preoccupied. Then, when we get a little older, we are assigned to read books for classes. There is even reading in the workplace, whether it be reciepts or orders or recipes. Readings is something that we cannot get away from. This leads me to say that authors write books for an audience and write the book as best they can to atrract the attention of the audience. I do not believe that books, regardless if one person deems them offensive, should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on. I think that there are things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book. There are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive. Also there are advantages to reading books that @MONTH1 show something different that that person @MONTH1 have experienced before.     First, I feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive. Everyone has an opinion and just because one person does not like the book, should not mean that the experience of reading that book should be taken away from someone else. If you find a book to be offensive, you can simply stop reading the book. Just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not also. That is just apart of humans having their own opinions.     On a different note, I think that childrens' books are a little bit different. Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children. I believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children. For young children, I think that parents should just read the book first and judge whether or not they think they're child should read it. Then for young adults, I think that parents could try to look up somethings about the book. The internet is a great source for reviews and ratings of books. Therefore, I believe that censorship for childrens' books is a responsibilty of the parent.     Lastly, I think books that are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently. When I read a book, think about the scheme, imagine the characters, and react to the events, I come up with my own opinion of the book. My friend, who is also reading the same book, could form a completely different opinon of the book. But we both gained something by reading the book.      In conclusion, I think that books should be censored by parents and that is it. I think that reading books is a very positive thing. So no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read. Also, books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about. It is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf.	4	4	4
3192	2	When I go to a library I @MONTH1 find some stuff that is offensive to me. But if somthing is offensive to me the person beside me @MONTH1 not  think the same thing  is offensive to him or her. When people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not . There is a wide variety of people that all have diffrent opinions based on their history.      What I think is offensive @MONTH1 be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded and other people's eyes. The major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set definition. I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on. There needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups. For example you would not want a kindergarder to be able to check out a @CAPS1 movie.      Some censoring has to be done to protect people.But it all comes down to common sense. We won't ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem @MONTH1 be solved	3	3	3
3208	2	If I could remove anything from shelves of libraries I wouldn't.  Would you rather your kids to learn things from the facts or learn from friends?  Censoring books, magazines, movies, etc and what goes onto the shelves are mostly for enjoyment or informational.  Granted you wouldn't want a five-year old reading a book made for adults, but with age kids would have to learn things.  You can't always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere including college and on into their adult life.     Books provide facts and more reliable information than what  you can hear from people.  If all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off, how would someone write a report on those things.  The books were created to provide people, kids especially, with facts that no one else could share and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge.  If someone were to find a book or a @CAPS1 offensive, they don't have to look at it or even pick it up.  Libraries can't always suit everyone's tastes and something you @MONTH1 find offensive isn't to others.  Takign a single book from the shelves would result in others taking books off the shelves and then no books would be left for anyone to read or wish to take off the shelves.     If you controlled what everyone read, no one would be happy and their brain wouldn't function correctly.  You'd be taking one of their rights, one of the only things entitled to them without someone else telling them they can't.  What kids read is shaping their minds for their future.  If you removed their favorite series or genre from the shelves, they wouldn't read or listen to music or anything anymore because it isn't enjoyable.  Kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to.     So with that, I wouldn't take anything off the shelves because everything appeals to someone in one way or another.  Controlling what one person reads doesn't lead you nor the other person anywhere, someone could end up being offended if you take something you find offensive off the shelves, and you can't stop the knowledge that books can provide people if they read them.  In one way or another something provides information for people.	4	4	4
3219	2	I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive.  First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines.  The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music.  Second, what @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case.  There is no need for an angry public or strikes.  Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to.  After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning.  So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from thier shelves that are found offensive.     First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library.  For example, one person @MONTH1 like to read philosophical books, and the other @MONTH1 like to read romance comedy books.  If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read.  Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading  @ORGANIZATION2's book, or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1.  I had an experience similar to this with my friend.  She preferred horror movies, and I historical.  The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city.  My friend was not happy.  The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public.     Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings.  What @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 not seem offensive to another.  An example:  a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover @MONTH1 be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child.  However, that same cover @MONTH1 be interesting to a young adult because he @MONTH1 be into surfing, suntanning, or @CAPS2.  Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used.  So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so.  The solution is for the child to look at @CAPS4 Magazines, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS5 magazines.  The library should provide a section for @ORGANIZATION1 so that they can read appropriate material.     Finally, I believe that the peole have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to.  They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music.  They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities.  After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment.  The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer.     In conclusion, I belive that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive.  This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', the for the sake of human flourishment.  Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place.  They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education.	4	4	4
3226	2	Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed.       Take music for example, there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it.     Movies @MONTH1 be different. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it.     Books @MONTH1 be the only exception. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about. which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else.       There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision.	4	4	4
3243	2	Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find a good book, and picked up a very volgar and inapropriate article? Were you dissapointed to see what children could easily get a hold of, or did you just place it back onto the shelf just simple thinking it wasn't your style of book? In this essay I would like to discuss both views on these censored books, and why I believe they should be censored.      People all over the world are vastly different. From color, race, size, shape, and personality there is not a single person on the planet who is excatly like the other, so why would they all have the same interest in reading or music? Some @MONTH1 enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while @CAPS1 my prefer the thrill of a horror story. Either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book. The same thing accures in the question, whether or not censored items should be allowed into a public library.      Many @MONTH1 say yes, people have their right to choose what they @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not observe or listen to, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is protrayed then don't pick it up.' @CAPS1 @MONTH1 say no, 'The library is suppose to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion I believe the parent figure is right, although I also can understand the opposing opinion.      As to the opposing opinion, I can understand why you @MONTH1 think that censored items are ok in libraries. If it is a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still makes a great story, I believe that the book is alright as long as it is not in reach of a child. Many people have different ideas on what censored means and there could be the consequence of loosing many books but there are always consequence to every choice, good or bad.      In my personal experince, I have taken my ten year old sister to the library to barrow a movie and a few books. She is very scholary and comprehinds things quickly. Futhermore when she found a book that she thought @MONTH1 be interesting. The book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Think about it, what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe enviroment? To me it is rediculous to have to search every single book, cd, movie or magazine for profanity to make sure it is safe for my sister to read! Kids these days have changed majorly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things and I believe a big part of why is because of what they take in through the worldly materials. If the books and the music they read and listen to are offensive and rude then what else would they know other than to follow the lines of something more 'cool' than them. Therefore I believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed.      When I sit back and realize what I would want my kids to be reading and listening to I wonder why people would even chance the fact that their child could be negativly influenced by it. Why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything they can to make their kids the best person they can be and I believe that they have a right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential. Therefore in the end books should be censored!	4	4	4
3262	2	How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen somthing that you think no other kid should see? Im going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries. After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace.      Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happends and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn?      The books that children read varys. The younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read @MONTH1 have words in it to display a seriouse part to the story, or a tragic monment in the characters life. Some @MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it.       Authers usally vary their vocabulay in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the @DATE1's why would they try and clean up the grammer that was spoken from that time. Try and change what the reader might think about that time.      Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear someing oddensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in	4	4	4
3265	2	A very wise man in @CAPS1 life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him. @CAPS4 went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a @CAPS2, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As @CAPS4 grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. @CAPS4 had no example of how to behave, yet @CAPS4 stayed away from @CAPS3, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography.      As I have been growing up with @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a hard working individual and having @CAPS1 mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, @CAPS1 parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' @CAPS4 had a valid point. In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers.      What has the world come to when a child of age eight @MONTH1 walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and @CAPS5 have the book there at all.      Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered. Well what if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD @CAPS5 have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is @CAPS5 the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest asured that their child is safe from the filth of inmoral things	4	5	4
3269	2	Typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere. Most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers. Many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials. In this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one.     True, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people. Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive? In my opinon people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent. If a book or magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be is offensive to someone, I believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item. People should not take this censorship ability out of hand.     I believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person. Which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it. I believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it.      People have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privalige. I think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards. In doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people.      All in all i believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds. People have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong. They should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better! Do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea? I do, because it gives people to oportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive.	4	4	4
3285	2	I think that if certain materials are offensive that they should be taken off the shelf, depending on how they are offensive. If they are offensive by rachism or being prejudice i think they shouldnt be on the shelfs. Also if it is offensive to women or men then it should be taken off of the shelfs. People should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it.     I think that if it is offensive to different races then yes it should be taken off the shelfs. I think this because, children can read this and then, they would beleieve that it is right to be races against other races. I think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others. Also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others.      People reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others. It could cause problems for the libraies also, doing this by people not wanting to come back due to the fact of they have offensive material. Then with people not wanting to be there then the libraies wont have enough service and they will have to close.      I also believe that if the masterial is offensive to women/men then it should be taken off the shelf. The magazines that have women and men in them can be offensive, because  alot of people look at them like they are trash. It makes a bad impression on some people. Its rude for it to be there. It puts not very good thoughts in some peoples heads.     I believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf. It can cause many problems with others. It could cause us to lose libraies if others choose not to go anymore. Things should not be left around if they are offensivce in any way.	4	3	4
3293	2	Recently the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention. This is unfortunent in the extreme. People have a right to unmolested knowledge and censoring libraries is a direct violation of that right. Libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way.     History is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious. We aren't always proud of want we do or what happens but those events remain, irrespective of whether or not we choose to acknowledge it. To think turning a blind eye to the less than clean will make it go away is not only unrealistic but also totally ignorent of facts.     I realise that there are some things chilldren should not see or hear and I'm not suggesting we expose them to these things. I'm merely saying that trying to hide them from what we deem to be unclean is neither right nor a good idea in general. We can't shelter our children forever and sooner or latter they will learn things we wish they didn't. This is inevitable. Life doesn't seek to hide its darker side from us at all and to hide it from our children will serve little more than to handicap them. Do children need to be protected for some things? Yes, for a time, they do but it is the role of the induvidual parent to protect their child. Protect the children but don't do so at the expence of everyone else.     Why should the views of some hinder all others? Those who would persume to know what people should see and what they should not are out of touch. Those prudish enough to believe that people need to be protected for natural, form history, or from their own desires have no more right, and preahaps even less than everyone else to interfere with induvidual decision making. People have a right to make their own choices on what them believe but no right to force those oppinions on others.       This essay @MONTH1 make no difference but it has said what needed to be said and thus served it's purpose. With that task completed I can finnish with a good concious.	4	5	4
3294	2	I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons. I feel everyone should know the history of the world, whch means rascitism or being offended. I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you , just turn it off.  You aren't being force to listen or read it, its your choice.      Libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but its something people go through life with. There @MONTH1 be people out there that probably disargree's with me, its just my oponion. You @MONTH1 go to the certain libraries in the world that doesn't allow certain people in because of their oponions on the selection of materials the library offers.     I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet @CAPS1 happen to the person but, its the fact that she went to the police. She could have handle the sitiutation herself, by just comforting the person about it. I feel that the mintue she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's oponion.      Libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were rasied or just born that way. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or @MONTH1 do somethings towards them in there lifetime but, they have to live with them.     In the end, either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change there ways for certain people that don't like the materials. They are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic. These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic. Its just apart of life	4	4	4
3297	2	There are many books that are not appropriate for childeren or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age. Childeren check out rated @NUM1 movies and rated @CAPS1 movies and unedited @CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at the age their age.     The libraries are supposed to make sure your @NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Also you have to be a certain age to buy @CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulger language. Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different.     My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulger things. It should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not.       My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree. There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privelages and they should respect them enough not to do them	3	3	3
3298	2	Many people base their actions on their own views. What @MONTH1 appear to be justified in their minds, due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others. One instance of this: media censorship. It happens every day, every place. Someone can take it upon them selves to ,in their mind, 'make the piece better for @CAPS8 viewing'. In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeading on the rights granted to us by the constitiution: @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2.                First up, books in the library. Everytime I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out. Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them. To me, it was irritating. I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and , for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book. Some marked-out words aren't always offensive to others, either. Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it. Others @MONTH1 enjoy it, whether they share your views or @CAPS7.           People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive. If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy. We, as @LOCATION1 citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should @CAPS7 be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I @MONTH1 learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable.           With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made. Wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like. It's called @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2, and it is a right garunteed to us, as @CAPS5 citizens, under the @CAPS6. And learly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it. Plain and simple. You might @CAPS7, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, @MONTH1 @CAPS7 be offended by it and might read it. Supply and demand. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced. You would get your way. But, no. Some people do read it and it is produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it.          People should @CAPS7 take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it. Others should @CAPS7 ruin the experience by marking the words out. @CAPS7 only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property. If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it. They have the right and no one can take that right away from them. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government, or other civilians, should @CAPS7 be allowed. We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in @CAPS8 libraries, the @CAPS8 should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the prinicples of the constitution, and it should be protected, @CAPS7 limited	4	4	4
3299	2	Many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive.  All of these libraries, however, have certain reasons to have these books.  Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation, the libraries have reasons for them.  So, the libraries that do have 'offensive' books, should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone, and they could be beneficial to the reader.     These books that are considered offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be offensive to others.  For example, @PERSON2, who is from the @CAPS1, comes into a library and finds a book that is all about the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and she reads that the @CAPS1 is full of a bunch of people who mistreated their slaves.  @PERSON2 gets a @CAPS5 offended by this. Then @CAPS5 @PERSON3, who is an @CAPS6 @CAPS7, picks up the same book and reads all about the @CAPS1 and how they treated their slaves.  @CAPS5 @PERSON3 thinks that the same book that @PERSON2 hated is a great book.  As shown in the example, @LOCATION2's people are very diverse, but what comes with that diversity is a lot of opposing views in its citizens.  A library doesn't want to only appeal to one race, it wants to appeal to all of them, the only way to have that happen is to accidently offend some people in the process.  The citizens of the @LOCATION1 need to be more understanding that their race isn't the only one here.  If a book offends a person, that person simply should not read it.  However, these books, who many @MONTH1 find offensive, could also be beneficial to its readers.     Some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it.  Going back to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 reference, @PERSON2 was reading her @LOCATION3 @CAPS11 text book, and she read about the horrible deeds the @CAPS1 had done regarding their slaves and the fact that they lost the @CAPS3 to the @ORGANIZATION1, and she got offended because her side lost.  Then @CAPS5 @PERSON4, who is in the same class as @PERSON2, was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on.  He found out that kids all over the the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the @ORGANIZATION1 defeated the @CAPS1.  @PERSON3 was as happy as he could be with this book, whereas @PERSON2 couldn't be any more displeased.  If this book was pitched out of the library, how would students all over the nation learn of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? They wouldn't.     Libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone.  As Katherine Paterson said, if we all picked a pile of books that offend us and got rid of them, then there wouldn't be any books left for any of us to read because other nations would be offended by the books that appealed to one, and so on and so forth.  So, libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books.  This nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to.  We just need to remember that not all of the books appeal to us and not to get offended by those that don't.	4	4	4
3303	2	I'm writing this paper today to talk about cenorship of books, movies, music,etc. I think that there should only be certain things on the self that childern can see. If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to. They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is @CAPS1. I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappopreite should not be visable to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else. Also the music on the radio is censored yes but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get affended by certain words and they are still on the radio, on @CAPS2, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people expecly children believe that certain things are @CAPS1 and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inapporpreite is shown to people making them believe it is all @CAPS1. There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are plating video games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's @CAPS1 and they grow up believing that. I am writing this paper today to ask of an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less	3	3	3
3349	2	There are tons of books in the library that people @MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today. I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library.     First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' @CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody.     Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike.      Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake. There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known. Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories.     Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable. Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people. Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste.	3	4	3
3350	2	I don't think that they should be removed from the shelfs. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To were no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's volgar or sexual. Then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person @MONTH1 love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you @MONTH1 have a person who is real religous and can't stand to see it.      There are very many view points of this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style. Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight. Should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?     Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it @MONTH1 affect the kids reading habbits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more. Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.     My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in controle of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away.	3	4	3
3353	2	My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are ment for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with '@CAPS1 does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know @CAPS1 to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.           When parents going through the explaination of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and i would not want a child reading a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a @CAPS4 your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.      Young kids and teens can always find things that they should notat certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now.	2	3	2
3372	2	Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. Everybody should have they own section for their age group.          Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. It's to much cursing and violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things.          There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things.          I think they should be certain magazines in the library. Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff.          In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read.	3	3	3
3384	2	Should offensive material be removed from the library? I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not ment to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels. I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc. should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with? Seems like all that would remain would be the dictonary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake.      So what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gosip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1. Yet people find these topics to be offense probably due to that persons backround. If aomeone find a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it. Instead, people deside to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and what it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lifes.      At the library I attend many poeple different shapes and sizes walk through the door everyday. Many of them like a different subject then the others, so its commen to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure someone here and there does not gree with an author, but never decide to go crazy about it. Instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the wuthor for his writing.          In my own read's, I have found at times stuff i disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are ment to be for one type of audience when instead another audience see's the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem.     I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc. should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it. In my own exprience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Once people start following guidlines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe will have something then. But until then, we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today	4	4	4
3410	2	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music,            magazines, ect should be removed from the shelves.              Libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to          know more information about something the library or the @CAPS2 should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the           Libraries and the @CAPS1 started putting these materials away, many people wouldnt bother to go to either. The @CAPS2 in my      eyes is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been threw, and things we have accomplished while we           have been there.In the @CAPS1 could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about you past?,'No, I couldn't.          Eventhough things @MONTH1 seem offensive in ones eyes, it could be the history of anothers. Many people now days relie on the           useage of the magazines, books,and music to get information from. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has                happened in their pass to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone           else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in lilbraries, @CAPS1, art shows because everything has it's on history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know. I myself, 'would want to know, than not to ever have known.'	3	3	3
3415	2	No i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive. Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read.           I think that if you dont like the book and think its offensive that you shouldnt get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it. Not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason. The library screans all of the books that they get in and wouldnt buy something if no one asked for it or  if it wasnt a good book to have.     I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it. Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoing the books that they have an intrest in? If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive there wouldnt be any books left on the shelves and no one would have books to read.  I also think that if you dont like the selection of books on the shelf that you shouldnt be lookin in that section, go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read. Theres something for everyone in a library.     This is why i think its not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves, no one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive'.	3	3	3
3422	2	I find it intresting that people think that its there problem to go to the book self and say this and that shouldnt be aloud here. I also feel thats if you dont like the book dont look at it. Or read it. I mean I kind of understand about the magazines becouse somethimes there can be pretty bad. I mean at the same time its noones job to say what is right and what is wrong.                   The music I am @PERCENT1 with it being taken out of the libraries. some of the music people lisson to today is just not right or kids or adults. People are wanting to know why there is so much killing and hate in the world today. The movies at the libraries are pretty good they dont let thim get to bad i cant compain to much about that.        All around the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it. Just some stuff that I would change but really what I think doesnt matter. Im only a @NUM1 year old kid i mean I can give my thoghts about it but thats about it. I love the libraries nothing will ever stop me from going. If I dont like something thin i just dont read it or look at it and thats how everyone should be	2	2	2
3428	2	First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. We have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time. From the @CAPS1 regime of @LOCATION1 to the banning of @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 empire. It always is a terror that falls violently.     Farenheit @NUM1 was written by @PERSON1 in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity. The human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told. In this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book. Their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness. As if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end.     Man must know his foundation and where he comes from. All it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf. Eventually they all will start coming down til there are none. The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous. When the malignant being is the government itself.     This all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions. What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? We have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it.     I, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. People have the right to know everything. Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so. Let man choose what is intolerable to him. Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. All freedoms are taken away by that one word. The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. The communists censored everything inside the @CAPS4 @CAPS5.     History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. The people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes. Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies.     A word is simply a word. People will always have their own views on everything. Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. The day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want. It is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest. What will become of the uncertain future?	6	4	6
3486	2	I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. Everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. That is what I believe in	1	1	1
3498	2	In a library it's censorship should be conrtolled by the people that go to that library. If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf. The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person, no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rateing once they have that only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc, are offensive to them.     Of course there are some books that adults @MONTH1 not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundry of what rateing of book their child can check out. Organizing the books this way anbody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf.     In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books. so to prevent a power struggle this way a comittee should be set up to decide what books to purchase. you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it.     The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the libray also, the books are just books weather you read them or not is your choice. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library.     In short my veiw of book censorship is that, the library will choose the books that go into the library. To make things easier the books should have a rateing system that would be the national standard for all public libraries. Like I stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them	4	4	4
3501	2	There should not be any style of censorship in the @LOCATION1. I am a strong believer that our country is the best because we are allowed by law and the constitution to have our own ideals, likes, and even dislikes. I understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages, but I do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves.      In the US we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles, and religions; this is one reason I think censorship is against @CAPS1 policy. One of the things that sparked our countries secession from @LOCATION2, was censorship. The @CAPS2 would not allow the colonies news papers to speak poorly of him or his ideas and policies; this is why when the US was formed the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 built freedom of ideals and speech into the constitution.      I do, however, agree with some censorship. The movie and song rating system is a form of censorship I believe to be needed. with out this form of censorship, small children would be aloud to see and hear things they are not ready for. This is also a good way for people to decide if they would like to experience the ideas and language presented by the matieral rated.     I think that there should be a rating system (or explanitory system) present in libraries. Instead of pulling conservercial books off the shelves completly, we should rather put a warning on them. I feel strongly that I have a right as an @CAPS1 to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture I would like to see. If we start restricting what we as @CAPS5 are alowed to see, we start loosing our freedom; we become like those who live in comunist countries where only what the government wants you to see is seen. The statement made by Katherine Paterson supports my ideals greatly; especialy 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. This sentence shows that if we start pulling or restricting the things people deem offiencive, there would be nothing left to read or enjoy.     Censorship in the @LOCATION1 is a direct violation of our consitiution. I am a believer in, if it bothers you or upsets you, dont read it. By doing this we can get rid of censorship, and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as @CAPS5. We also allow our right to be informed to be excercised.	4	4	4
3517	2	Do you think there are certain books and magazines that should not be displayed in librarys? Well here's my perspective.      I think that librarys shouldn't have certain books due to racism, violence, and etc. One, because there are young children that read books throughout the library, and two because books and magazines due to racism and ect. can be offensive to others.      How would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that? That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age. So that's my perspective on it	2	2	2
3519	2	Some books are offensive to some people. But eveyrone has the right to read any book they want. I believe we shouldnt censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find offensive from the beggining, find another book to read or talk to the teacher.           I have had my experience with books who are offensive to me. Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. But that same book i have read might be interesting to other people. Whatever doesnt @CAPS1 you makes you stronger, right? So don't take a book in a hurtful way. Books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people.      I had poeple come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience. Specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. I told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her. Thats all you have to do and not make anything big about it.      I also read the book, 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2', which is censored in some states because its hurtful to some people. The story is about a white family trying to help an @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man who was accused of raped when he never commited such thing. That was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him. Its a great story about what black poeple went through in earlier years. And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive.      He got harrased and his children got harrased but he still fought with all he had to save his deffendant. I am a @NUM1 year old boy who when he read this book knowing who had a heart and who didnt made me cry my eyes out. It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is defenitely one of the best books i have ever read and also the only one that got to me. It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway.      I feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people. They might not even test it anyways. They might just say its gonna offend this kinda people and thats it. How do they cokme up with it? Do they let everybody read it once? No, and they should just leave it whoever doesn't read it doesnt have to or they can talk with their teacher. Its not so hard to decide to censor something when its only your opinion. Thats why i would look into the opinion of others.     All in all censorship shouldn't be allowed. It ruins the oppurtonity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. Let the kids read atleast in highschool when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want	4	4	4
3526	2	Do you think that certain books, music, magazines are sometimes found very offensive? If I had kids I wouldnt want my kids to be around any of these bad things. I think that we should remove all of these bad things from the world to help the kids and childern become better people in the world.      There are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see. When people like great singers sing about drugs and other stuff kids think that it is cool to do drugs so they start to do them and then they cant stop! You want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does. We need to encourage our children to be great people but we cant with drugs and volience that goes on around them, but we can try to banned the bad books, movies, and music. We need more good things to influence our children. We dont want our chilren to look at magazines and see women that are really tiny and they think that they have to look like that to be popular. If your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them. I listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life.     These are all the reasons why be should banned these things from our children. If you want your children to be successful then you will keep your kids away from the volience and drugs. I know what kind of things happen when you dont keep them away. You dont want these things to happen to your kid so keep them away from it.	3	3	3
3528	2	Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library? Some books could be very offensive to people and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that. Others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away. Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they @MONTH1 be. Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it.      Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. It shouldn't be taken away from them.  If parents don't want their children seeing those things, the shouldn't take them to that section. Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable. No matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision.      In libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section. If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to children's section where it won't be seen. In the children's section it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children. Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it.      Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day and you could probably find this news in a library. It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but I it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch. Thats why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there.      If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. Taking away the things some adults @MONTH1 find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair. It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. Not all adults would understand both sides but I can see where both sides are coming from. If I had children I wouldn't want them seeinig things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it. Having music, magazines movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it	4	4	4
3534	2	No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive.  I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is in their right to not allow that child read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely.  That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that book and possibly gain something out of it.  There are some non-fiction books out there that can marked as 'offensive', and they are just that non-fiction.  It is something that really happen and anyone can learn something from it by reading it, and to take it away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained.      I believe that in a library people should have a choice to read what they choose and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it.  I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that and then everybody wins.  I know that I have read some non-fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with that book I also learned much about the topic at hand.  To take away that book would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another.  If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left our children to read and to learn from.  They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence as hurt someone emotionaly and physicaly, and that they should never do it in fear of the concicence that they might have to face later on.       Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge.  We live in a world today where education is everything, and we think that everyone should have an education.  But if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from.	3	4	3
3540	2	Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system.     In the US people have the right to expressed their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. Many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. I think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie. If they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class.      In school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. If we want to learn about something we should be able to. Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? Do we take the teacher out of the classroom? No. We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. It's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden. I think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us.      Censorship is illegal where we live. But why isn't it taken seriously by the government? I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer. We get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody. So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation? We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. It isn't fair to us or the writter.	3	3	3
3551	2	In my opinion,  I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited.      When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.          Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well.      Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.      Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that @MONTH1 not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, @MONTH1 be seen as a good thing to another.	3	4	3
3558	2	Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries? Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay.     I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't. Also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things. Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them.      Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others. But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't. People have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either.      Well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves. I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it	3	3	3
3562	2	'hey', I believe that certain materials, such as book, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.        First, I know that people have different views appon things such as magazines, books, and music. And I also know that there are somethings that @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but they aren't offensive to other perople. Such as music there are all kinds of music out there. And I know that some people find rap music offensive and some doesnt. Because A lot of people that doesn't find it offensive relates to it.      Second, I feel that if the people that find it offensive would just ignore it then it wouldn't be a problem. Because I know that maybe there is a type of magazine, book, or even a type a music that they listen to is offensive to someone else they might not find it offensive but I bet someone else finds it offensive. So for them to judge these things wouldn't be right.           Third, I'm pretty sure that if something in the library was too offensive the library wouldn't have it. But maybe if we would take the time out and worry about our self instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not then the world might be a better place. And yes i understand that people have different views but we shouldn't let that get to us.        So you can see, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. Because there are billions of people on this earth and I doubt they would all give you the same answer. Because So many people have different opinions, and beliefs appon things.	3	3	3
3566	2	Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the libary? Well,in my point of view I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. are amazing, exciting and fun to read or watch they should not be removed from the shelves in the local libary. For a fact people in general have many types of tastes in books thier's drama, romance, action and many other that also apply to movies, magazines and etc. The public should not be punished for one's intreast in themes, and how they take the book. Thier should be an age limit in witch kids can't read certain books and those of age should read whatever they please.          I, myself  like to read scary books, they give me chills and all types of questions runing through my brain. Someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought I have when reading a scary book. Without books that don't fit are personality thier would be less people in libaries reading and more people trying to keep themseleves occupied and half of them might even get bored and start commiting crimes, to keep there self  occupied. People in the community have rights to read, hear or watch witch ever type of material they like.      If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with. They should look for stuff they would enjoy, not just because the book is about 'violence' or just simply don't like the theme they, should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it. Books and other material were meant for us to enjoy them and from the authors or directores choice to share with us thier stories. Without books like those many people can't get ideas to help them creat thier own book or novel.      So that is my view on the situation, people should enjoy whatever material they like. But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazienes should be removed, take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local libary and see how it will change your mind	4	4	4
3567	2	There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library. You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made up stories for fun. There are some materials in a library though that could be offensive. But should those materials be removed from the library? Some think that they should and others think that they shouldn't be.     In my opinion I don't think that things should be removed from a library. Certain people @MONTH1 find things offensive and others @MONTH1 think it is perfectly fine to have in a library. I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in  library.     I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material. People don't want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult. That would teach kids bad things that they don't need to be reading about. I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults. That way kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults.     I also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about. Like if there are books on slavery they should have an area for books that are about that that way people who are offended be it know to stay away from it. The same with magazines. i don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people @MONTH1 enjoy reading them.     Some reading material @MONTH1 be found offensive to certain people but to othersit @MONTH1 not be. I think things shouldn't be removed from libraries. There are some things that people @MONTH1 need have in a library if they are doing a project that way they have the resources to do it.     I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store. kids don't nedd to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school. That just isn't right. Espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing.     So in my opinion there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library. Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing. Magazines and other things should be kept away to where only adults could get to them	4	4	4
3574	2	Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2     The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1.     Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.      I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.     I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television. Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.     If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom.	4	4	4
3600	2	Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages. That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way. I will talk about why I disagree with this statement. Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement.     I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from. So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book.     If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.     Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them.     This is my opinion of the statement. Many people @MONTH1 not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement. Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy. Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them.	4	4	4
3612	2	What is a library?  A library is a place you go to that has books, movies, music, magazines, etc.  With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment.  Should there be censorship in libraries?     In my opinion there should be very @CAPS2 censorship in a library.  If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library.  Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imaginate, and dream.  They don't worry about being offended by a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 book.     However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately.  For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it.  What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard.  If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room.     If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures.  For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf.     Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar.  While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended	4	3	4
3620	2	People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive.  The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people.  The truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes.     Libraries are places of knowledgee.  They keep many differnt books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library.  Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like.  So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not.     Magazines are like books in away.  People know what they want.  With magazines though, people ususally just flip threw the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skiming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read.  Usually after that, they are done with the magazine.     Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around.  There is something about music that soothes the human body.  Music is one of those things that ais constantly changing with time.  Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced.  Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't.  There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music.     There are people who hate change. Likewise thet don't like to change there favorite music types.  But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a  few types of music.  But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played.     Just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement.  Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it.  But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change.  Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on.  Directores try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie.  But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive.     Movies are suppose to be enteraaning, not something people should get offended by.  Movies are good about it though.  They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie.     It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it.  There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing.  It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same.  So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will	4	5	4
3628	2	Censorship in Libraries      I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In @DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive.      Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model.     Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies.      Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life.      Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used.      In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have.	4	4	4
3646	2	In @DATE1's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take materials away, we would be take most of what is made for entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger. Well, why don't we do something about it? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something. Adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them.      If you were to walk into any store these days you would find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing the best they can to seperate these materials from the family oriented materials. Sometimes it is just not enough, children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age. These children share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things.        Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn. The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to. Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible.     Like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of them. The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and other places, but just kept where children don't go.     I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from @CAPS1 rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future. There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life. Keep the children away from these materials, it will be a better world if we do.	4	4	4
3664	2	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:     I am writing to you today concerning cencorship in libraries.  I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some @MONTH1 seem offensive and to others not at all.  However, I do have my own view point on the situation and I feel that @CAPS2 is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves.     Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do.  With the world the way @CAPS2 is now, violence can errupt from the simplest of things.  Putting books on public shelves for the public to read, can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions.  Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result.     My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books.  This will create a safe and happy envioronment for all who visit public libraries,and other public places.  @CAPS2 will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors.  Children follow in their parents' footsteps.  Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this postion.  When our children grow up, we want them to beahve in a responsible way.  Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior.     As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are resepectful, happy, and responsible. I want people to get along with each other.  I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in.  Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that.  Without offensive books for the public to read, will create a better environment for the people living today.	4	4	4
3672	2	There are so many things these days that people find offending, in so many different places in magazins, books, movies, cell phones, on the internet,even some words in songs. Some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self.      A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this? I dont want them reading this! What if it messes up their childhood? Honestly parents if you dont want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them too these places where it is at? On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that its something they should not be ossiated with.     Also if  evryone took things off the self what they found unoppropiate then we wouldent have anything left to read, listen to, or watch. Alot of times one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person to no end. For example @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable, but @PERSON2 could find the very same the extreamly offending. It would lead to many arguments amoung or communites.     Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well, and would not be a good idea. If this were to happen then kids would grow up thinking that this is a esay world. This world is harsh and not easy at all times. Kids learn alot of this through the media. As long as we have postive role modles to exsplain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong, and they should not take part in it, then why would it need to be removed?      If people were able to do this then the communities would have alot more crime from anger, we would have nothing left to read watch or see, and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to exspect from the media. So now i ask you, what do you think	3	3	3
3687	2	Books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life. We all know whats wrong, and what's right.     Every school is different. Some schools have limits on their books, such as if you're two years old, and reading something like @PERSON1, then that's gonna be inappropriate. If you're sixteen and reading a @PERSON2 book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit. Every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2. Most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five. Books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading '@CAPS4'. Just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be. Be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it.     Don't we all agree that music is life? Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. Don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music? So why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking. I say who cares? Don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else. I love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned. In my opinion I hate christian songs, I think they're too slow, and constantly talking about @CAPS5, but that doesn't mean I should ruin it for everyone else, just because I hate it. Everyone is different, no one is the same. Music helps me gets through life, and I know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned.     Movies, movies, movies! Video games, video games, video games! We all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us. Movies have ratings like video games do. Ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old. Adults would most likely be playing a rated @CAPS6 game, and watching rated @CAPS7 movies. Little kids about the age of six would be playing rated @CAPS8 games, and watching rated @CAPS9 movies. As you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things. Rated @CAPS7 movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch. It doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned.     In my opinion, I think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. It just should all be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it. We should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves. No one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless I am a youth. Then material should be suppervised by my parents.	4	3	4
3718	2	If I found a book that offendide me i would have to go and take it off the shealf because if I find that a book is offensive i know that others would think the same. I agre some books can be offensive to some and not to others and its really not fare for thows who think that way.     One reason that i would take it for that shelf would be to keep youn childern form reading it. Parents dont really want there childern reading about vilence and murdare.      Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people. people killing others and be doing sexaule things. People really shouldent read things like that because it puts things in there heads and somtimes make the think the same way as the writer.     If childern read books about vilence and sexaule actions they could think that its ok to do these things to other people and get in to alot of trouble with the law and there parents. Children really need to be keped way from these kinda of books, tell there older and undersdtande whats right and whats wrong. Some books have alot of cursing in them and alot of childern pick up on words and start using them more and more tell it becomes a habbit.     Evern thow some books are of real people they should still be taken off the shealfs. In some of these books there is alot of vilence and childern should not be exsposed to that kinda of book     Books can sometimes be more bad then good. If everbody had there way and could take a book that offendid them off the shealf whenever they wanted then there would be no books left.	3	3	3
3725	2	Hello my name is @PERSON1 one day me and a friend were in the librairy on @DATE1 @TIME1 looking at some books. Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway. @CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it. So school went by the bell rang it was time to go. When she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian.      On our walk to the librairy @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink. While were were there she got a newspapaer to read about what was going on at the scool when she noticed something about books about how they needed to be taken off the shelf. when we walked in the doors to the library the librarian was sitting at her desk she asked us if we needed any help. @CAPS1 said no but I need to talk to you about a book the librarian said she was way ahead of her. That she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelfs. And moving the to the back closet.     About a week or so later @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library it said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelf and they were replacing them with newer and better ones. Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldnt do it because of one person said it was offensive but they did it any way.	3	3	3
3734	2	It dose not really mater to me, we all have the wright to are one likes and dislikes. Someone @MONTH1 not think that movies with blood in thim should alowed, but other @MONTH1 thimk that movie with adalt content should not not be alowed. If you dont like something and someone eles dose why should you get what you want and not what someone eles want. So if we tacke one movie, book, magazine, type of song or music off the market why dont we just all of thim off the market. Then there will be no arument about what is soutibal to watch and what is not. So if you dont like somthing or have littal kids and dont want thim to watch something or read somthing or look at somthing then just bont bay thim and if you do make sore it were they cant reach or fine or get to	2	2	2
3766	2	Certain books, magazines or even music contains mature or graphic nature. The music will always have ratings, just like movies. They dont need to be deleted from a library unless it is an elementary school. Most language arts are sorted through out the library in an orderly fashion, so the younger children will only purchase there age level books, or art of choice.      Music always contains warnings for the rating of the book. a child should never murchase a mature level book. books, movies, and music are all the same. they are made for certain types of audiance. If a movie is rated @CAPS1, then it is made for eighteen or older audiance. They are situated throughout the library for children, adults, and teens. The children just need to stay in there own age levels.      If there is a mature or graphic book in a childrens library then that should cause conflict. any parent would agree with that statement. The only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries. public libraries that are divided to connect with all age groups	3	3	3
3770	2	Censorship is a very sensitive topic. Everyone has to deal with censroship whether it is directly or indirectly. There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past. If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored.     Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor one piece of literature or film that offended them in a certain way, then everything in life would be censored in one way or another. No matter what, there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by. Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1; the @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to @LOCATION1 citizens. Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all @LOCATION1 citizens. There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, because they all deal with the freedom of speech, or the freedom of press. If the act of censorship begins to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive.      Some citizens @MONTH1 argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all of the inappropriate, offensive, and derrogatory language and situations from our nation's youth, but from a teenager's standpoint, the children will find out about such situations and language use regardless. There is no point in hiding the truth from anyone, because no matter what they will find out eventually. We need to push for less censorship in the @LOCATION1, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the first amendmant, then we need to fight back censorship and remove it completely from our society	4	4	4
3771	2	Libaries everywhere might have a book or two that @MONTH1 be offensive to a reader. I haven't found a book offensive to my readings just yet. Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library. But some people are against it, like me. Its going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines,etc., from the library.     Music in the library is good because you can't find old music like in the @DATE1's in a music store. If someone finds music offensive in the libary it might be because they don't know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through. Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music. I'm sure there's a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from. Maybe then they wouldn't be so offeneded.     Magaizines in the library are really for people who love the media. There are so many magaizines that have interesting facts about what happen or what's going to happen. For example @ORGANIZATION1 has all the newest event or something big that happend, just in that one @ORGANIZATION1. Then there's advertisments, how would people get money if they didn't put there adverstisment in a @ORGANIZATION1 so people could buy there product. If not nobody would buy the products.     Movies in the library are for teachers to show students. Half the stuff in the libary, you can find at blockbuster or walmart. It's because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual with the movie. So they read books.     Overall I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and don't change they way the library is doing things. Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offeneded by already. So its already too late for that. But its going to take more than one person to be aganist it. So that's my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library	4	4	4
3775	2	If you were an author, would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone? In my opinion, I believe that there are some references, considering movies, books, music, magazines, and more, that are inapropriate. However, I don't think anyone should have the right to take them off the shelves because they are offended by it.     If everyone had the right to take something off of a shelf because it offends them, we wouldn't have anything left. In my mind, everything could possibly be offensive to someone. For example, I read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders, just like everyone else does. The way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible. Considering I've been a big time cheerleader my entire life, I got a little offended because I'm not the way the book described them at all. After reading the book, I might not have enjoyed it, but it was my choice to read it. I wasn't going to @MONTH1 back to the book store and demand them to take it off the market because I, only one person, didn't like it.      My philosophy would be to just ignore the things you don't like, or not to purchase the item if it offends you. I know that the age of the targeted audience of some books or movies aren't always the only ones that come across them. For example, a child coming across a movie that includes inapropriate languages or scenes. That is when I say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are for you. Or parents, censor what you children see, hear and read about.      Moreover, I do not think it is fair for someone's artwork, whether it is music, a book, magazine, or movie, to be taken off of display or off of the shelf. Those authors or creaters worked just as hard as anyone else. Just because it is not best suited for one person, does not mean it isn't suited for someone else.      In conclusion, I don't think it is fair for items to be taken off of the market because it doesn't please a few people. I'm sure there is someone out there that will enjoy it. It wouldn't be fair to the artist, after all of their time and harkwork. Everything on the market could probably offend at least a few people in some way, but welcome to the real world. They just need to learn to deal with it, or ignore it like I do.	4	4	4
3787	2	I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults. I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to.     I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d. or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book.     Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly.     If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission. I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were @NUM1 years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit.	3	3	3
3793	2	A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.     Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. @CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!     Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.  By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.     Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.     In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society	5	5	5
3819	2	The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that poeple wish that there kids or even there on self did not read or that people wish they did not read. But if your were to take away ever book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of tone the author uses or if they do not like what they call eachother. People all have there own mind sit to away that they want to live or how they want there kids to live.      Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there books on the shelves about kids drinking then have bad effects on there life cause they did drink then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. The books about getting raped and them not telling becasue they are afriad of what would happening. Then in the long run telling after they get pregant or injured from it. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to might help them feel so relief and tell someone and save themself. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do and it couls be all that one person that did not like it fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone. Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good Author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but truns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe.     I have a friend that have parents that do not like the music on her ipod. So she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made @CAPS2 of the songs that they did not like. She drives so they music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her ipod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that poeple do not like. Either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get there songs from there.     There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artics now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use there brains. No one can stop them. Not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio.      In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid @MONTH1 grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid there age getting kidnapped they @MONTH1 understand more clearly on the whys in life.      So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for thier little girl or there teenage son. They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the self. Keep playing the some music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on there own rather then you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over agian. So keep the books on the shelves. That the radio play. Just be safe in doing it.	4	4	4
3837	2	I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries. All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons @MONTH1 not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read.     I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some. My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer. Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value. Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surrreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them. Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject. Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for, a resource for knowledge.     All offensive items a library @MONTH1 have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes. No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the sheilding nature of others.	3	3	3
3851	2	A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things.          Magazines @MONTH1 not be any help towards alot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you. Music is not just something you listen to, but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book. Movies can have a certain impact on someone; alot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying.      No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know. People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a persons life. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of school, or even the public libraries.The more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they @MONTH1  understand life. I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading. Its really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, thats why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves. Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf , the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life. We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world.	3	3	3
3858	2	The @CAPS1 Materials     Have you ever came acroos a book that you thought was really good, but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know. My censorship on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taking off the shelves. People should have ther own choice of books, and who has the right to tell someone what they should read. My opinion is that materials that @MONTH1 be offensive to certain individuals should not be taking off the shelf, but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books, music, movies,etc..     I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age. The book was called @CAPS2 @PERSON1, but it was just full of action/adventure.This was very unfair in my eyes, just because I was young I couldnt check out a certain movie. This was experience that I been through, which lead me to my opinion that materials that might show certain offenseto someone should not be removed.      Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things. No one is going to have the same interest all the time. So by takiny materials away is just helping one person, but hurting many by taking somethimg they @MONTH1 be interested in. I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around. Then again I think all materials are not the same they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from.     In conclusion I believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay. The reason being is because by the material that might show offense to an individual, might just be very interesting to another person. This a saying I heard before from the ebony magazine ,'another person junk @MONTH1 be someone else treasure' which I believe is a good saying for this topic	3	3	3
3864	2	KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF!     I think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library. If we did that then there wouldn't be any books left. The only thing we should be worried about is the rated @CAPS2 movies. Yeah those can be taken out of the library. If one book is offensive to someone, then dont get it, but someone else might like that book.      For example, an older woman is looking through this magazine, and she sees this teenage woman taking drugs, or being half naked. Although the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip. We shouldn't get rid of any books because then we would only be down to one genre. There wouldn't be any categories left in the library.      A good idea is to separate the books, put the ones that seem offensive in the back. keep the childrens books away from the big mystery horror books. Another example is this. A student goes to the library to work on a history report over slavory, but there isn't any books on slavory because somebody thought it was offensive against african americans.      I understand that there is reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of some sexual content. Children do not need to be around those kinds of books. Or some books being taken out because of religious belifs. like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil, or something.     The movie situation i understand. I wouldn't want my little daughter walking up and grabbing something that has a sex scene, or drug content in it. You can take those off the shelf, but wait, right there is another example of why it shouldn't get taken off the shelf. Just because i want it off the shelf doesn't mean everybody wants it off the shelf. Then the libraries movie business would be over.      To sum everything up, nobody should choose what should be in the library and what shouldn't. Personally i think that there should be a variety in the library. If not everybody would get bored of the same books. Over and over. KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF	4	4	4
3879	2	i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult show's. i can see why they put it on the kid's show's.. but like really?you guys will put that stuff on good movies? or song's!? what has ever happened to freedom of speech?	1	1	1
3896	2	What is censorship? Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of.  Censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing.  Does censorship really help in our society?  Actually think about it, there is still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censory.  How I would argue with this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings.     Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows.  In some movies you get to choose on what you want to watch. The unrated version or the censored version.  Well, most people want to watch the unrated version, beacuse it's more than likely more funny and shows more.  Other people might choose the censored version, because of the fact that they have children and dont want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version.  I would perferably pick the unrated version, because i like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version.  Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out alot of words, because of course you are not allowed to say them on television.  Parents dont want their six year old going around and saying all of them nasty words.  That's why most of the time you hardly ever see them kind of shows on in the afternoons, they are usually on at @TIME1 or later.     Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows.  I cant say that I dont watch shows that have some language in them nor can I say that I dont watch shows that are all bloody and gory.  I do watch them, but i would never watch them around my younger sister!  She is eleven years old, I dont want my littel sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her.  Then she would say well @PERSON1 was the one who watched the movie.  I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either.  Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money some how. Right?     Last but not least, my readings about, lets say books and/or music lyrics.  So many books have been banned across the @LOCATION1, because people were offended by them or just didnt want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it.  Some songs cant be played on the radio, because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and through out the song.  That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular.  I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also my grade level and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were.  When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and dont let it bother me.  Same with songs, the artist probably has a reason why he/she uses the words they use.     Censorship can be good or bad, it really depends on how you look at things.  Honestly, I have no objections to censorship and other times I do.  My experiences, observations, and/or reading has made me think about how censorship could be bad or good.	4	4	4
3897	2	I believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book. What some people find as offensive some other people might find it not offensive. I do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves.     For example if there is a person of the jewish religion they might find a book about hitler offensive. In that sense if they take the book off of the shelf then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at. Without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten.     Another example would be slavery. I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with. In the reality it was a hard time for the africans. I do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation.      If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the bible. Some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it. So how would that work out in the long run? it would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well.      In reading books as a kid i have found that some things are bad and i do not like them, but i dont believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books.How do you take away from the people that like to read different nopvels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future.                                                  this is an essay by @PERSON1	4	4	4
3912	2	No criteria such as books, @CAPS1's, magazines, etc. should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. The @LOCATION1 is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine, you don't have to read it.     When people get all upset over a book or movie they saw it really drives me crazy, simply because you don't have to go see that movie, or go read that book. Different people find different things offensive, this can be because of race, gender, ethnicity, etc. So we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive. Some people think it is offensive that proffessional athletes get paid @MONEY1 for playing a game, when there are homeless people living on the street. Never the less the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is the most watched event in the world when it comes on. Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good. Another example is racial jokes, some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive. This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes.      Just as Katherine Paterson said, no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive. People do not find the same things offensive, so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue. If you find something offensive then just dont pursue it. Almost every single book in the worls has something in it that someone, somewhere finds offensive. If we took all of these books off the shelves, there would be nothing left to read. This is a free country, which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not. So instead choosing to eliminate books from the library, just dont read them, because maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do, and they might like to read that book.	3	4	3
3919	2	Libraries are a source of information. They provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts. Therefore, I do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out.      Everyone is faced with choices in life. Some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life. We decide if we want to wear the black shirt or the grey shirt, the blue shorts or the brown shorts. Everyday we have choices. We also have choices at a library. If we see a book with a title that sounds like @CAPS2 might be offensive, then we should just walk past @CAPS2. Most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated. Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material. We have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not. If @CAPS2 does offend us, then @CAPS2's our own fault.      The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life. No one forces us to check out this book or that book. @CAPS2's a choice. No one puts a gun to our head and says, '@CAPS1 this book or you will die.' @CAPS2 just doesn't happen like that. No one forces us to @CAPS1 something we don't want to. @CAPS2's all up to you and how you feel about the book.      Different subjects offend different people. I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however; I am offended by sex related instances that often occur in movies or books. I make my own choice to not watch or @CAPS1 those kinds of materials. Since everyone is different, the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see @CAPS2 as perfectly fine to watch or @CAPS1. Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because @CAPS2 offends one person should not happen.      If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset. Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive? @CAPS2 would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle. When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play. Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god? Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because @CAPS2 contains one curse word in the whole book? There is no way to properly censor all your books without upsetting customers.     I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man. Some are obviously worse than others; but, when @CAPS2 comes to books and movies, the people know what they are checking out and know what they will find offensive. There are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display. Libraries should not censor the materials they display	4	4	4
3923	2	Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public. If these offensive things were not aloud to be showed I personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents.      Everytime you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician you see embarrassing aspects of their lives all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life. If it wasn't for actress and musicians we wouldn't have any television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radio's. There would be no reason to, their would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us.     Books in the libraries should not have sexual assualts in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Expecially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them not vaulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school.      Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child brining home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from are local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. My library would have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films. She said that the movies should be seprate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie. Or atleast have a parents permission.     Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Lets keep are children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in are school libraries and local libraries it is just saying it's ok to letting this violence in. We should put a stop to it and prevote good attitudes. So please take the violence off the shelf	4	3	4
3929	2	What do you think about Books? Do you think it matters how appropriate they are? Well im going to tell you my oppinion on the books that should and shouldn't be in libraries.      I think that there are many different few from many different people on books. Someone just cant say that they think a book shouldn't be in a library period. I think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library. I can see that some parents @MONTH1 not want to have their kid reading it but i think that they are going to hear a lot worse and see worse than a book is going to have.      I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they dont want there child reading that kind of book. I belive that if a kid wants to read it than they are going to read it, parents shouldn't be so up tight on what there kids read. I know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it. Also a grade school shouldn't even have a book that would be considered inappropriate to a student in there library, or should have a parent sign somethign saying that they are ok with it.     So inconclusion thats what I say if parents have a problem with it than they should discuss it with the school. They should just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they dont want their child to check out such books. All a parent would have to do is go in to the school or where ever their child is getting the book and tell them that and it would solve all problems	3	3	3
3935	2	Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves                                             In every library it is intitle to have all types of books, movies, and magazines.Even if they are good or bad. Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves. Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like.      If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true. Every library in the world should not take certian books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1. If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources.     Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books,movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see whats new ,or watching all different types of moive, and listening to music.     I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, moive, or magazine that would offend people today.     Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended, they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about	3	3	3
3942	2	Things that mean so much to just one person     @CAPS1 to start this off, I am going to say Katherine Paterson is saying / @CAPS2 what is correct.They're is alot of @CAPS3 around this world that is very senceitive about there things in there house and around there life that they wouldnt want anyone to touch. Or be around.     One important thing that I have that means so much to me & my @CAPS4 is the @CAPS5 that my @CAPS6 gave to us right before he passed away. Me & my @CAPS4 have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time. But we just cant get the nerve to do it. We do not like it when someone thinks they can just do what they want by walking up there where we have that @CAPS5 and just grab ahold of it. @CAPS1 me and my @CAPS9 do not like that. So we say something. Thats one thing that we @CAPS10 like for anyone to touch. Because it means so much to us!      Most @CAPS3 think we are crazy because we @CAPS10 like anyone to be around or touch it, but all I have to say is that there is other @CAPS3 around this area that is more crazy about there things being touched. For example: ' @CAPS10 be over there by my clock hanging on the wall I @CAPS10 want you to knock it off, so get away from it! ' That is something that my bestfriends @CAPS11 had said before. & she still feels the same way still to this day! But I mean its just how we feel about everything around us that means alot.     But to get back to the situation about why do @CAPS3 get so fustrated about things that are hanging on the wall, or things that are in cases and thats where they have been for years and years. Its because it means so much to them. Its not just cause there mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe. It just because it means so much to them, & when I say means alot to them, I mean a bunch bunch!! There just trying to say that it means more then anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered. Just try to understand what there trying to say to you. Because it could mean so much. & you could get to the point to watch out for it also. Just to help out.     But the store that Katherine Paterson had wrote is saying the right thing. & she also probably has things in her life to that means alot to her. You just have to reconize what she has that is so important because there is alot of @CAPS3 that have impotant things in there life, & you could be one of them. Just try to see & feel how alot of other @CAPS3 do around the world around you. Just have to remember whats important to someone and help keep an eye out with them. & because a good friend to everybody else.	3	3	3
3953	2	'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom. I immediatley hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book. Some parent don't like for their kids to read some content. If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school. There is some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying or parents, and coping behavor from book.                There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and refelct actors, actresses and artists. Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid. Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media.      It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students. Though some students don't nessicearily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best intrest to remove materials that are offensive. It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch. I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decison at home to to become involved in such thing.      I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likey to model after them and do the thing they do. Lets say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something. Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool. If I did the things @PERSON2 done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got luck somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure.      So  in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraires because it insures the well being of students and protects them form things they odn't need to be part of. I would respect the idea of censory in my school becaus eI would know it is only there to help me. I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or book	4	4	4
3964	2	Is it offensive?          Should people have the right to take down other people ideas? What do you think; I think so ? for centuries people have been writing,making video,and, all types of music. Some consider it a freedom of speech. Others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy.     I believe @CAPS1 are exceptional writers and promising producers  and artists. But not all medias are good. Over a vast amount of time young children have been influenced by medias such as:books,movies,music,etc...Its perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media .But thats not all @CAPS1 are more cases than just children that are suffering theres also religon, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups.          @CAPS1 should be a certain rules and certains laws that are against such wrong doings.But everyone is entiltled to @CAPS1 opinion.Hundreds of people are discreminated because of what they here and see in the medias.A life changing expierience for me was the movie The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This could be considered offensive to lots of peolpe such as those of the african american decent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse.          This is just a few issues with freedom of speech ,but @CAPS1 will always be disagreements and differennt views of oppinion.But I for one believe that theres just certain stuff that shoukdnt be allowed to be put out in to public media	3	3	3
3966	2	I'm ok with censorship on reading materials. I understand that the poeple selling the prodects want to appel to the eye and make poeple buy what they are selling. I have alot experience with this because I read alot of car magazines and they sometimes have alot models in them, but I'm your avage seventeen year old and I'm ok with this also, but there is a lamt.     My school is very good about this they see one flag it and put it in the back , but they still let you read it. I like this because it keeps the bad apples off the self. I have a very good kinship with my mom and dad they do tell me I can get, but if it's nineiy-five perent cars and only five perent models they are ok with that.     I said a thing about limt. All things have a limt like how much hosepower stock parts can take on a car before they break. I have a limt on what I buy sent I'm not yet eightteen I can only car magazines but don't get me wong I love cars and have sent I little	3	2	3
3968	2	Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? I thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. And then you wouldnt have even known about it. Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see.	3	3	3
3982	2	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive? Censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in librarys or some @MONTH1 not think it's so important.      Books are important parts of peoples lives, learning, etc, they are also read for many different reasons but some of the topics books are written about @MONTH1 not be right or could be innapropriate or possibly against all of someones beliefs or religion. I personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of librarys just some thngs shouldnt be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library maybe materials that are innapropriate for children or people @MONTH1 find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials.     Another reason why censorship @MONTH1 not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that @MONTH1 be offensive or innapropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on @CAPS1 or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day. @CAPS1 has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that @CAPS1 show or movie or internet site could have on the minds of todays young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today. Todays children and young people should be taught of whats wrong even if they do think it's dumb or unecassary at the time when they mature they hopefuloly will see whay they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on @CAPS1 and not get involved with these activities.      Censorship I still believe is not necessary even though I know of all the innapropriate and harmful things in todays culture. Even though I know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music if they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with whats right.     In conclusion censorship is not necessary, it could be in the future but if everyone is lead to what is right they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike.	4	4	4
3995	2	Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of  music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive.     First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves. Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start.     secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger. Same with music, movies, and magazines.     So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do	3	3	3
4010	2	The library is an important place for the knowledge seeker.  The library holds books of past and current writers.  It also holds information on past and current events.  Censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offenseive history, books, or newspaper articles.     Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history.  One reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information.  Periods like the holocaust, the genocide of about six million @CAPS1 by @LOCATION2, would eventually die with the generations that knew about it.  The holocaust was an event that became known @CAPS2 wide during @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which was a major historical event.   The slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship.  The slave trade is a major part in @CAPS5 history that helped shape the country it is today.  Another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance.  If we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history.  Keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn.  Censorship in libraries aimed toward historical events should not be allowed.     Also, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.  One reason is beacuse authors wrote their books how they intended them to be read.  An example is @PERSON2.  The author of The @CAPS6 of @PERSON3 and The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION2.  Both books use the word @NUM1r to convey the tone.  Another examample is the author of To @CAPS7 A @CAPS8, @PERSON1.  Another reason to ban censorship in books is because that's an authors writing style.  The author writes a book how they want it to be read.  Therefore they use the language and words of the time period they write about.  @PERSON2 didn't use @NUM1r because he was racist, he used it to convey what times were like and how people talked.  Censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.     Finally, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to get rid of newspaper articles.  One reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information.  It brought peoples attention to recent happenings.  It informed people of what was going on.  Getting rid of that is just another loss of information.  Newpapers were key players in getting out information about @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the assasination of @CAPS12 and @ORGANIZATION1.  Another reason to keep from censoring newpapers in libraries is because of their importance today.  They continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events.  An example is the death of @LOCATION1 and how he caused the deaths of many @CAPS13 on @DATE1 eleventh.  Articles about views on the death penalty.  Censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries to get rid of offensive newspaper articles.     The library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker.  There, they can read about past and current events.  They can also read classics by great authors.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles.	4	4	4
4012	2	My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways.     Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person.  If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed.       People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there.  Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think.  A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying.     From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously.  Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos.  I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it.  In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they  are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them.     I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries.  Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials	4	3	4
4015	2	Books on shelfs are there for a reason    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson wrote. The quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children. Libraries have non- fiction and fiction books as well as magazines, music and movies. I myself like to learn a little bit of everything but of course there is things that I dont like learning when I am too young. I like discovering things on my own. There is times where I do like discovering new things because I dont know when life ends. In other words I'm surrounded by reality and have to come out of the fantasy world. Magazines also just have a lot of trouble and sometimes, yes it's life but also its just dramatic things about people     A library is a good place to learn lots of things. You can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people music,etc. Honestly, the only thing I go there for, is to read and to check out books, but from books I have learned a lot. There is some material that shouldnt be read and discovered when your too young.      Theres material that is too strong for some children and they should learn it as they grown not in a bunch. Libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have a warning signs for their age. There is times where it is good to learn about life but you have to becareful because it @MONTH1 be to strong. There is books that teach you a lot. I have learned a lot from old books to new books. I don't think that the books should be removed, yes they @MONTH1 be strong, but is our owns choice to read it or not. There can be racist books, but they are there for a reason and it's not to make fun of people.     Magazines also are sometimes good because they teach good things and keep you updated about whats going on around the world. There is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people. I dont think its important and to be showing other people's personal lives or criticizing it. That is deffinetly not good for children to learn at that age. Magazines shouldn't be removed because everyone else has a decision at what to read and what to look at.      Music, at the library there is mostly music from like a centuries ago, but they were also great composers. No the music shouldn't be removed because everyone has a different taste in music. There's also new music, everyone has different taste and should choose what they want to listen to or who to listen to.      Movies, are a big part of life, so I think. Theres a lot from them that I learn from. From slavery to the future, there are movies where I have learned a lot. There is also some videos that are rated @CAPS1, @NUM1, @CAPS2, etc. It is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not.      There is different reasons why there are certain books, music, magazines, movies that offend people, but it also has a significance. Books are not racist so other people can be made fun of but to learn what they went through. I'm glad that I as I grow I know what to learn and when I'm to young to read something. I think it should be allowed because it's for everyone. I dont think nothing should be removed from shelves even if the material is offensive	4	4	4
4019	2	The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves	3	3	3
4028	2	When @LOCATION2 was made and our fore fathers signed the constituition of the @LOCATION1, freedom was the big kahuna. With every signature endorsment added to the constituion, @LOCATION2 became one of the few countries with freedom in every right. Laws such as 'you are innocent until proven guilty' and freedom of speech have made our country stand out from other nations that suppress thier own people.Freedom is @LOCATION2's middle name and it is the birth right to our future!     Freedom of speech has been shown everywhere and even though some people's voices say a little too much it is still a right given to us so we must accept the nonsense that is said. Offensive things are common, since we are all differnt and the variety of ethnic groups in @LOCATION2 are so vast, that at one point in time someones toe are going to get seriously stepped on. This is not tolerated but still it goes on through the world. Freedom of speech is a unidentified form of express, since it is allowed to say what you feel but sometimes it is said to much and you end up in a fight.       Speech is still a freedom though, and if we cut out freedom we would be in a bad spot. Genocide, and inlawful inprisonment are two factors that happen regulary on account of no freedom. If you speak out against a powerful figure, you go to jail. If you belief in something differnt armys come and kill you, all because some country do not have freedom like @LOCATION2. This freedom might cause controversy and produce offensive products such as reading material and videos but its alot better than living under the shadow of a dictator.      Crude forms of freedom always end up on magazines, books, and cd's but if you think about it there being produced then they are being bought, or they would not be made at all. On certain occasions items are not being made for economical benefit but mearly on belief and religous values, that is also a freedom that many have paid with there life, to have. Also with the production of books, movies, and cd's you are protected from being exposed to points of view you do not like these things do have a rated supervision system, and if you do not like the product put it down and walk away, yes it is that easy.       I do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon, we might just have to keep living with offensive products. We should all just be glad we live in afree society that lets us express our diffrence without being killed in the process. You cant just go take the constitution and disgard like trash so society will just have to bear the burden of expressed freedom. Freedom comes in disc and books but it is still @LOCATION2's middle name and the birth right to our future	5	4	5
4069	2	Have you ever went to a library and found that some books arn't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? Well I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading.          I have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way to extreme for kids to be reading/watching. I personaly think that children who arn't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed of rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2. What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books.           Some of you are probly like 'but it's not like there going to know what it means.' @CAPS4 if children don't know what something means then that deffinantly won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands on or watching other things. They will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean. No parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then thats when you can bring out the older books/movies. But don't let them read it on there own. Usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age @CAPS5 and up. Thats when you as a parents can start letting them read and watch older movies and books.          Tweleve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on there own. Thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect. They know what is happening and they know how to handel it.           In conclusion I think that rated @CAPS1 books, magazines and movies should be kept above ages one-@CAPS5. I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts. Then once they hit highschool they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about	4	3	4
4084	2	Today in our day and age we have books, music, movies, and magazines that say or show materials that young children and teens should not be seeing at their ages. I am writting your newspaper company to tell you that I think the censorship should be implied more in libraries. Their should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. that the parent has to sign before that says, '@CAPS1 child can see or hear the materials being displayed.'      In this centry we have @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows showing violience, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs. Its almost impossible to keep all children away from these things, but we should at least try to. There are shows on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 now showing teenage pregnencys, and they are pursading the viewers that its okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person. @ORGANIZATION1 shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize with no conserquence. Also they have violence and uneeded langauge.      I know from @CAPS1 own experience watching @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 dad has came into @CAPS1 room, and told me to turn it off. That they shouldn't be allowed to do somethings they are showing the viewers. I know when I am married and have children I will keep @CAPS1 kids away from certain materials as long as I can until they are old enough to understand, and know the right thing to do in the situation. Some of the language they use such as 'retard' I find offensive.      In @CAPS1 opition the censorship in libraries and in households have really declined. Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors. A good parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching is appropraite for there age.      Even books have sexual contact, and language. When I have children I will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them. Magazines these days are even worse. The call the @CAPS7 '@CAPS6 @CAPS7' for a reason, and young teens are picking it up off the shelves at conveniate stores and are reading it. Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, refuring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs. Parents need to get more involved in their childrens life, and what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring.   I hope you read this essay and really take it into concerderation. I hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you for your time	4	4	4
4099	2	Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.       Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.      Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example. The movie industry might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries.      Music artist might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.      Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work	4	4	4
4101	2	Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them	4	4	4
4113	2	No, I believe all materials should be on the shelfs at libraries. Because some people like stuff other people @MONTH1 find offensive. But you as parents should control what your kids are reading. If you find it offensive tell them to pick out a new book, new @CAPS1, a new movie, or a new magazine. If you don't its not their fault it's your fault.     Some people like stuff that others don't. Such as, stuff from anther culture or maybe something from a different religion. But we can choose to read what ever you want to. If you don't like it find something else but, some people find it interesting. Not everyone has the same veiws on stuff. If there are books just for adults put it in anther room to were miniors can't get in. Make it to were you have to show an @CAPS2 that says you are @NUM1 or older to get in. Than you can look at inapporiate books without haveing to risk kids seeing them. Than in order to check them out if you're under the age of @NUM1 a parent or gaurdian has to be with you if you want to get it. If it's a @CAPS1 or musican that has cussing in it you need to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent check @NUM4 out for you. Because some parents don't let their kids listen to bad music.      Like I said in pervious paragraphs I believe that they should't take stuff off the shelfs that a few or some people @MONTH1 find inapproite. Because a few of us might find it interesting to know that this world isn't all the same. People are different like different things	3	3	3
4127	2	Do you think that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive to people? This is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another. For some, it just depends on your age, your beliefs, and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place. In my opinion, I think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves.      First of all, I think a lot of it depends on your age. For, example, most older people think that most of the material made today is just crazy and do not want anyhting to do with them. Although, for the younger people, thet is what is new and 'cool' to do. I do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids. We want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it. In my own experience, my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part. I think it has affected me a lot today on who I am today.      Next, I think for some people, it depends on their beleifs. A big thing with this is race and culture. I often find books, movies, or magazines offending another race. This the the thing that I find most disturbing about some materials. Anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion. There are countless numbers of these materials just theat I have seen and I am sure that there are many more. It @MONTH1 be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves.      Lastly, I think that a lot of people do not know that what they are going to read, watch, or listen to, is going to end up being offensive. I have seen a countless number of movies and listen to a countless number of songs that were offensive. The sad thing is, I did not know it before I did it. A lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat, as far as knowing if it is offensive goes. I think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves, then it should at least be marked as offensive.      All in all, I think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves. We have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do. Even though there are factors like age, beliefs, and knowing what you are going into, I think these materials are just bad for everyone. In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves	4	4	4
4134	2	As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. Multiple variaties of books @MONTH1 be found at a local library from documantaries to science-fictoin or just fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one @MONTH1 choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposses the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some @MONTH1 disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary meassure that constricts the ability to gain knowlegde.     In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people @MONTH1 be able to enjoy their diferences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dilikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books'(no pag.). If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it shuld be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents.      Still, censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inapropriate, is an inexscusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none osf our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.). The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's belifes. Doing so will not only help libraries but also society.     There are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree. Yet it is important that poeple agree on allowing each other to have a choice. A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read. Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process. Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion. Censoring of libraris should be considered, but not at the exspence of knowledge. Libraries should not be censored.	4	3	4
4135	2	I believe that this idea is not a good idea because some of the the students would need that information to look up ideas that they would need to write about in a report or to right in a final. The reason the libary is here for the students to have and take there advantge to put time in to looking up what they need for their classes.knowing me I put the time that I need to do my work in class so i know what is need in the report so I know im doing it right and not just making up something that I could just stick in the report.   I see that it is imporant to keep the materials in the libary to have the convence to have thing that is needed to have to look  up a celebrity that is inporant to keep in touch with . If your writing in the news paper you are needed to the infomation that you  can get  your hands on to keep all the students informed in how there celebrity is living there live. If students are ready to graduate and there needing to go on line to look up type of colleges that they could attend before leaveing @ORGANIZATION1 so they could be prepard to be ready in the world they were set out to be living in to start a live and acomplish thing that our parents didnt get to do.    The intrest of the libary to inspire some of the readers in the class to go out and read book that can show the situation on how your health benifits are by looking in the cancer book for information from how the sun and  going to the tanning bed can cause skin cancer and can hurt your skin just by makeing your self look older by gettingas tanner.   I think the situation of the libary is to be use to  for our education and our benifits to learn more from book and reading it a lots interesting than just watching a show or a rerun of a tv show or even movies that show all the action in a movie that you can get from a book with more details	2	3	2
4159	2	I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people. A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers. As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text-form. Creativity is a large part of life, and without it, we would all be the same. There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter, there is a book that will interest you.      It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content. With different personalities comes different writers. With different writers comes different books. With different books comes different readers. There are a lot of people out there who like to read. What are the people who @MONTH1 like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves?      Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors. I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone.	3	3	3
4163	2	There a books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. that are not appropriate for children. Having them banned from shelves shouldnt even be a question, if children shouldnt read, watch, or listen to it then its the parents responsibility to make sure they dont.     I dont think they should take those kind of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown ups also. There just gonna take them down for the children but lose buisiness from grown ups and teens. That doesnt make any sence at all. I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen too, and if they cant then its up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose.     A way to solve the problem can be seperate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children. That would make everything alot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and knowone loses buissiness.	3	3	3
4169	2	Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group. Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent. At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to. This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries.      There will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended. One movie, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 specifically, created conflict. While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a differnt movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As @PERSON1 said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left; people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century. It is the way our culture is. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine.      In the @ORGANIZATION1 censorship has almost never been present. It is part of what is great about this country. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as @CAPS3, not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is untimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read.      Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area. In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude. Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved	4	4	4
4203	2	Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but @CAPS2 all depends on who you are and @CAPS1 angers you. Somepeople think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but @CAPS2 can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries.     From @CAPS1 I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is '@CAPS1 gets them so angry?' @CAPS2 is different for somepeople than others. For example, a @ORGANIZATION1 fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. others can get mad at a movie because @CAPS2 discriminates races of other kinds. Like how in the @NUM1's, some movies characterized @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. In my view, actually being @CAPS3 @CAPS6 myself, sort of aggrivates me too, but none the less, shouldnt argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech.     @CAPS2 depends on how @CAPS2 angers them also, like how back in world war @NUM2, the @CAPS7 people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @CAPS8. That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldnt worry about @CAPS2, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read @CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if @CAPS2 is truly offrnsive to people in general, not just you.      Then after that the main question we would ask would be '@CAPS1 should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library @CAPS2 came from and ask them to read @CAPS2, and if they think @CAPS2 is offensive, then they would more than likely take @CAPS2 off the shelfs. Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, dont tell the library, thats just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read @CAPS2. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination, but not over a sports team.     So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending. Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons, not silly one	4	4	4
4227	2	Why would you ever censor anything in a library? Apparently because things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect. can be found offensive.  If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if its going to be open to anyone in the public, including children?       First off, censorship is important but we don't need it in libraries of all places.  Libraries is a place where all sorts of literature comes together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature.  Censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelfs because they are considered offensive.  If a book is offensive, first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to.  Then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience.  If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library.  Otherwise it should be placed in the adult section of the library.     Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature.  As mentioned before, if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience, it should be placed in an adult section.  Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section.  You can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers.  Sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship.  Sections help correctly place books and other pieces of literature in a library so that onlt readers of certain suitable ages @MONTH1 read them.     In conclusion, sections in a library can be used instead of censorship.  If we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library the eventually there will hardly any books for anybody.  Sections help keep books in a library, but keeps them in a place where the right audience can view them	4	4	4
4236	2	To be honest if I was a librarian I would leave them up on the shelfs accoding to what @MONTH1 state law would have to say. If the state doesn't have any promblems with having them up on the shelfs then all student body will be able to check them out. having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not. Also just like checking out a book how you have to take a test over it called reading counts. Then you would have to read an article from a page in the magazine and wright an essay over it and submit it to whom ever is in charge of that department.	2	2	2
4245	2	I believe that if it has offensive language then it shouldn't be left of the shelf. Also it really does matter if it has offensive language because you don't know who, where, when you child is going to learn offensive words. Another thing he's  going to say any offensive words. Next one of the most important thing is that if you want your child to never have offensive language or any other bad thing you should watch what you say, what you do. One reason why is because once he growing up he might follw you foot steps. Another thing is that if the magazine, movie, book, etc.,might have some raisem thing like jugging the person from where he/she come from, how they look, how they talk etc., can end up in a bad situation. In conclusion what i'm trying to say that it's both parents and book because the book your child has choosen might bad thing and the parents should watch them self on how they act	2	2	2
4246	2	Every parent wants to protect their child's innocence. They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions. The truth is though that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the @CAPS1. It is their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material.     One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It is all about choices. There are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people @MONTH1 want to read or watch something with such content. Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them. People should have the option to read or watch what they wish. Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to such topics.     Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 is a very true statement. After one censoring, people might still think topics are inappropiate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left. People eventually will not be able to use libraries. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource.      A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person might not be to another. How would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided? It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not. Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it. It is as simple as that.      There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are obvious. Censoring libraries are going to eliminate a person's choice. It will cause problems, as to what is appropiate and what is not. Eventually libraries will have nothing left. Of course every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices. Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things. All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong.	4	4	4
4254	2	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right	4	4	4
4255	2	Have you ever been reading something that made you mad? Well, to be honest I can't remember the last time I walk into a librarie and found something there that could had offended somebody. But thats just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person.      No, I don't that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out.     Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve, but I could image that there are people out that are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others its hilarious.     All I'm trying to say just do'n get all upset over something that you have read.	3	3	3
4262	2	Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music , movies , and other things for entertainment. Mainly children use the library more than any other age. The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed. No one wants to check out thinks that are offensive in any type of way. Not even books that will influence bad things. Therefore certain things shouldn't be allowed to be checked out in libraries.     Certain movies shouldn't be in the library. For example if a  child go to library they @MONTH1 see a movie that contains sexual activity and decided to check the movie out. The kid @MONTH1 be  underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate. The child @MONTH1 get in trouble by there guardian. In reality it would be the librarian's fault for letting the child check the movie out. That is why the movies should be censored.     On the cover of many magazines women as well as men bodies are exposed.That @MONTH1 cause children to be attracted to the magazine. They @MONTH1 even decided to check the magazine out. Children are influenced by the things they see. Seeing naked bodies would be considered setting a bad example.      In today's world all children listen to music. The music you listen to has a huge impact on your life. The music in libraries should be censored. Libraries should have music that encourage you to go out and be something in life. In my opinion only influential music should be able to be rented out.     Reading is the key to success. Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you. Not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex. Libraries should only have history, math , and educational books.     In conclusion everything in the library should be censored. A lot of children use the library. Therefore it should be age appropriate. No child needs to be put under a bad influence. Certain thinks should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion.	4	4	4
4263	2	I think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some stuff in it that little kids could look at or watch. The movies and magazines will sometimes give some kids some ideas and the books should be removed because it had some words that people will be saying and the music should be removed because they have rap music. People shouldn't be listening to it. The music is sometimes not appropiate for all age and it can give people some ideas of what they say or do. The books and magazines can give people some ideas of what they say or do and they can believe anything of what they say. People should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music. They are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives. Peolpe shouldn't be listening to some rap music or read the magazines or read some books that will give other people some ideas. The books sometimes talking about what happened a long time ago and stuff like that and it sometimes offense people like that. The magazines sometimes tell people what happened in the past and thenpeople don't want to read any magzines anymore. The people don't want to listen to any music anymore or read any books anymore. Most people will think that most books, magazines, and music are bad for the kids and for the adults. I think that it is offensive because music is not a good thing to listen to like rap or hip-hop. The people shouldn't be listening to rock music and they should just listen to some music that are appropiate. The books should be appropiate for all age and they should read something that they like. They should read some magazines that they like and that are good and appropiate.  The music is offensive because they talk about inapproiate  stuff and they shouldn't be listening to it and the magazines have some inappropiate stuff and the books have some inappropiate stuff. The people won't like it and they might not want to check it out again or they won't check nothing out. I think that they should put some books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will like. They should put some magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read	3	3	3
4271	2	My views on censorship are strong. I think that if a book, movie, ect. is descriminating towards one or more groups of people then I think that people should have the right to atleast have a say in wether it should be on the shelves of a library or not. Although books could be descriminating too, if the book it about something that has happened in the past and is the past of our country, then I think that people should also have a say in keeping it on the shelves.           If these materials are using offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against that race then they should be taken off of the shelves. If they are part of the history of the world or of our country, then I think that they should be left there for future generations to learn about it and to know that these things happened. Most materials dont try to discriminate any race, and if they did, then I don't think it would be in the library in the first place.      For me, censorship could go both ways. It really just depends on the stuation and the material. Someone could have an opinion that it is offensive, but that doesnt mean that is a fact. If the book is popular in the library and a lot of people like to come in and read it, then I don't think I would remove the book. People view offensive writing and actions differently from one another. So, I think it depends on the situation.           If I was a parent these days, I would let my child read one of these so called offensive books if it was part of the past for our country. My attentions for letting him read it are for all the right reasons. I dont attend to let him read it so that he can act upon the things told about in the book. I would let him read it to learn about the past. I think it is a positive thing for children to know about the past.      So, in my perspective, censorship depends on the situation and the material. These are only my views on the topic, and also these statements are my opinion. So I can't really say if I am for censorship or not.	4	4	4
4285	2	Do people take offensive books serious. There are lots of stuff in book that people @MONTH1 think is offensive. Some other people @MONTH1 think differently. I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways.     I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library. They see stuff that's around them. they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library.     In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing. Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs.     I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world that it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they coudn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library.     We shoudn't take books offensive. After all they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library. Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly.	3	3	3
4296	2	Dear Newspaper,      I would like to start off by saying yes, books, magizines, music, movies, etc., are great for the kids in the library.  I think thats the best thing for them to do when they dont have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate.      In high school just walking down the hall ways your going to learn alot of things you probably dont need to know yet but when you walk into  a library they dont need to encourage it by putting  books of drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves.       Books about drugs are alright to an extent.  If your reading about medicanes you can take and being in the doctors office and getting percriptions is alright but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth thats a little much.  We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them but we dont need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth.      Books about alcohol are the same way.  We need to know the dangers of drinking but we dont need to know about teen parties and things to do when your drunk.       Advertisements, magizines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because everyone of them have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those thing in high school. The front cover of magizines always have people who have got caught with drugs who is dating or sleeping around with who and ik that we will and need to know these things but i dont think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it and we feel the need to do it or try it.     I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taking out of the librarys so that the kids have something to learn about and ask there parents about.  I have been in the librarys and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three invloved in it because those are interesting and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an @ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and I think I want to go to a party they made them sound fun.     This is what I think about some of those books on the selves and what I think should happen.                                                                       Sinceraly,                                                            @LOCATION1	3	3	3
4310	2	I belive that there should be no censorship in the country of the free. In the country of the united states there should be no such thing as censorship. This country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want. This one band got banned in the united states of @LOCATION1 for there music. How can your music get banned in the land of the free. I think that there should be no way that any thing can banned in a liberary there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad. I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents dont want there children seeing. So dont censor it still have it just make it where you got to be a certain age to see that movie from a liberary. There should be no sensorship in the land of free speech. How would we be call the land of the free if we are censoring everything. That is why i dont think we should censor anything in @LOCATION1.	2	2	2
4316	2	I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books. People should enjoy reading all types of books. Some people only read different books. Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction. It should not matter what other people think.     If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read. Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves. What would happen? I will tell you, you would lose customers.     If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books. If that won't work, then make an age limit. Have the parents show you their berth certificate. Have a resticted section in the library. In order to get a book from the resticted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed.     Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either. The other things you can figure it out on your own.     This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should go on in the library. I will give you some advise. Think before you do. That is all I am going to tell you.	3	3	3
4329	2	You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library. While there, you see some advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far to inappropriate and offensive. What would you do?      Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, that you believe is offensive, you should say something. Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework, is just plain wrong.      What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what? So many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disasterous! I @MONTH1 not have children, but I do have younger cousins. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inapproproate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian.     Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who. For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards. One card is just to check out regular books. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older.      I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some @MONTH1 find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians desk. This way, noone who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need proof that they are eighteen or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials.     Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, ect., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction.      This is how it is at my neighboorhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions. If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them. Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials.      In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart. I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off. Thank you for taking the time to read this	4	4	4
4331	2	I have seen some turely a offensive books on the sheilf of libraries. Book that make you worry about what would happen if a child @NUM1, @NUM2, or @NUM3 looked at thes books since that is where their mind absorbs the most knowledge but what if this knowledge was offensive to a race of people or a persons religion. This childern are the furter of are species. This should be censored in libraries.     Tried to a imagine if they had looked at books writen @CAPS1 and other nazi members during nazi @CAPS2 rule. Mabey they looked at a book by @PERSON1 or other famours killers. If they saw photo book about the massive jew death camps in europe. Movies that show war torn battle such as @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, world war @NUM4, or world war @NUM5. The famours movie 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4' a movie based on the crulty of the @ORGANIZATION1 and the @CAPS5.     This is my view on censorship to protect childern from the a offensive things in or on books, music, movies, magasines. Their should be censored in all things childern can get in to. Imagine the world where the was no corntal media what they could put on	3	2	3
4358	2	We all have our favorite books and some we like others @MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.     To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like @PERSON1 for example, @MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.     Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others @MONTH1 not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it @MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.     I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want	4	4	4
4376	2	Going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things. Some items are not appropriate for everyone though. Certain books, movies, magazines, and music should not be accessed by everyone. Having an adult only section would be a way to solve this problem.     Removing certain materials from the library would not be in good interest. Any popular material should be available at the library. Many best selling books would be wrong for children to read, but they would be perfectly fine for adults. That doesn't mean these books need to be taken out of the library. Children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though. Having a section in the library from which only adults can rent the items, would remove this problem. People under @NUM1 should also be restrained from looking through these materials. Having a childrens' section in the libray would also keep them away from adult materials. The library needs to make itself user friendly.                People who frequent the library often pick up a book, not knowing what it holds. When inappropriate material is inside a child might innocently read into or see something they are not supposed to. Parents should not have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate pictures or text. They should feel safe letting their children look through all the books at the library. Library workers should also make sure the adult materials stay in the hands of adults. Allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library.      Taking adult materials out of the libray is not a good idea. It would lower its popularity. Everyone has different interests, and they want to research them at the library. The safety of children is also important. Making sure children cannot reach these materials is a concern. Having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem. Not allowing anyone under @NUM1 to check out explicit materials would also help. Keeping the libray full of information but still safe for children is the ideal situation	3	4	3
4382	2	I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books.  However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries. because they will separate be washig some bad things and they will be a bad idea	2	2	2
4391	2	I believe that the certain materials such as books,music,movies, magazines, ect. they are here for a reason. People like them. Maybe there are some books and things that people @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not find offensive. Thats ok I'm not try to say it isn't, but you don't have to look at that book. There are so many others to pick from it doesn't have to be the first one you pick up. The objects we are talking about are our entertainment it brings us joy and many smiles. People need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachers,but through these tools. Tools is a better word for these things. It makes them have a meaning.      Children now day love books, music,movies, magazines,ect. As a teenager I can say that most of us who like music we love it. It builds our charater. People don't make books and magazines just for them to sit on a shelf and gather dust. They were ment to be picked up and look at. I also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this. Don't get me wrong I can understand were their opinon stands,but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Children,@CAPS1,and @CAPS2 all have to learn in one way or another. Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well.      If people want this is going to be a big war. Only because they are not the only people on the planet. People want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin. Next couple of years from now people will want to get rid of something else then, something else. Its just one right after another it won't stop. This just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion some are good and some are bad. In this case, my opinion I totally and completely disagree with getting rid of the tools that can inprove our world as we know it to be.	3	3	3
4393	2	In this world you never know what someone might writing. There're many materials in this world that I think aren't appropiate for someone to be reading, watching or listenning, ect.  You @MONTH1 be thinking that anyone makes his/her own decision of what they read, watch, listen.  Well, I do agree with that, but I do believe that some materials aren't rate it properly to age.  I do think that some materials should be banned from people under age, some from kids, and some from everyone.      You @MONTH1 be thinking that all of this is wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, ect., but in my opinion some materials are just offensive and not proper. I seen so many materials that I think are not proper for people under age to been looking at. In some movies, for example, the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or language.  You might not think it's that big of a deal, of course, but I do. In my opinion, some materials are not too low in rating, and should not be for people under age.     It's not surprising to me that kids are now yelling, hitting, and or acting like a rebels to their parents. Many of this things kids get it from books, music, movies, ect. This is many of the reasons some materials should be banned from kids.  You ask yourself why? Well, first of all, kids are just learnning and they do everything they watch, see, or listen. I mean now kids don't even think about what their about to do.  They just do, they don't care, they think it's okay. I think that parents should be alert to offensive materials in the shelves, and should say something about it so they banned them.     Why banned some materials from everyone?  Well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are not right? You @MONTH1 be thinking that we just do it for fun and that it's enjoyable and nothing wrong with it. Well, you @MONTH1 be right but also wrong.  I certainly do agree with you, we all watched things for fun and to enjoy them, but some things are just too out of this world for us. Why do people do crazy things now in these day? In my opinion, I think is because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, ect.  I think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what. It's the right thing to do.     If you don't want to see this world get more out of control than it already is. Well, we need to do something about all these materials that are offensive and banned them for good.  We certainly don't want to see our kids yelling, hitting, or and actting like rebels to us. We don't want some crazy person coming to our hosue and do crazy things to us just because that's what they learn from those materials they had on the shelves.  It's come to me that some materials should be banned from people under age, from kids, and some from everyone	3	4	3
4400	2	Billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy. Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams. Being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations. Every reader seeks out a different style.          Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind. Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options. The necessity for censorship should never be an option. Writers compose for all sorts of people. For some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an @CAPS1 @NUM1 cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. Taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical.          Whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. If the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in affect. Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options. To each, its own.	4	3	4
4401	2	Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be consored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have @ORGANIZATION1 covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialougue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public. Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that i looked at.     When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would for every week, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 could freighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world chamionship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the @CAPS3 and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians.     I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life. Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved @CAPS7 show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me.     I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary.     Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that. Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials. Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust.	5	5	5
4402	2	Yes there are many things today that have censorship,but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out.     I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,@CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment.     If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1.     Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older.     So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people	3	3	3
4407	2	What do you think about them taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive? Everyone has a different look on it. It is an important thing to think about. Just stop and think do you want your child looking at that when you are not around? Many would say no, because they are to young to know about stuff that shows to much and other reasons also.Taking all the ones found offensive off the shelves would be the best idea for the case of young teens, and childern.     I believe that they should be taking off the shelves, and you have to be @NUM1 or older to buy them in many reason. The biggest reason I think they should is, kids under the age of @NUM1 want to look cool like the older teenagers, but really don't need to see that. With the young teenager think they need to do things like the stuff in music, movies, to be cool and think if they do that they @MONTH1 look cool. Young teenager don't think about what they are doing, and just think it ok because the older ones are doing it and they see it. With magazines, and movies, and music they need to be of age to buy. One big reason to believe that they should be taking off the shelves is because, a lot of kids and young teens thinks they can go in anywhere and look at things that are found offensive. There are a lot of different types, and you have to be of age to go into some places.With believing that they should take them off the shelves, it gives the @CAPS1 a fill free about your child to look at things without think about the offensive ones.     I hope with reading my persuasive essay, I hope i relate to someone about the books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive can relize what i'm talking about with young teens around the ages of @NUM3 and if you take your child with you and they see something like that. With the a stuff  I gave you it helps you see the out look on stuff that is offensive on the shelves	3	3	3
4416	2	Is @CAPS1 Right?     Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic.     In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are puble areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions.     A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing. By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1. This is a quick and easy fix.      There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly	3	3	3
4435	2	I don't think that censorship in labraries is right, for many reasons. First reason is that all books and contents that a public library offers to the community should be open to everyone. Second reason is that what you might think is not appropiate, to someone it might not be.  Last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on is book how he feels, without having to worry that his book might be taken off the shelves of public labraries.     My first reason why I think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community. For example if a student needed to do research on how black slaves were treated back in history,he might not be able to find a book, to find information on it because someone thought books like that are offensive to black people, so in this case this student wouldn't be able to find any information on his topic, because of the censorship in his library, so instead of going to a library he will have to go somewhere else, where he might find the wrong type of information.     Second reason is that what you might think is offensive, might not be to another person. So why should your point of view affect another person.  It wouldn't be fair that a point of view of one person would limit the choices that a person has when he goes to the library. Censorship could take away your favorite series of books of the public library because of group of people thought it was offensive.      My last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on his book how he wants, without having to worry that his book might get taken off the shelves of public libraries for its contents. Sometimes the content that books have is needed to make the book for discriptive, and interisting to the reader. Content that you might think is offensive, is the content that really helps the reader understand the book better.     This are the reasons why i think that censorship is not right. Because if we had censorship on public libraries, then we wouldn't have any books left on the shelves for us to read. So this are my reasons to support my opinion.	4	4	4
4438	2	Book @CAPS1          @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I dont think @CAPS4 book's,magizines and etc. should be taken off the shelf because. Book's help people read and concentrate. In my case the more book's the better and these book's have been here to keep us occiupied. Without them we would have no bref discripson or what happened in the past. Book's have alway's been here to support us and every story must have some fun detail. Without book's I don't know what we would be doing without them.                                                                                                            Book's have been the greatest thing in my life and @CAPS5 hurts for us to know that you wan't to get rid of them after, you made us read them when we where kid's so what is the point of getting rid of them when we got this far. In magizine's there's lot's to know about our people and how we live. We have gotten this far to go to the top. At least when we do read we know how to do some certain things For instance, do you remember when you were a kid and you alway's hated reading but now, a whole new change went into your life and you now know what to do. My fravorite book I have ever read was the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 was inapporite but @CAPS5 also had meanning. We have to keep these stories alive and im not going to let you take the thing we love to do away.               I love book,s and I hate to see them go away. these book,s were here when we were kid's and we have to keep the lagacy up. Reading is the best thing in life and @CAPS5 helps clear our mind's. Thanks to reading I was able to explain to you this much and how supportive I am with these book's. @CAPS5 would devestate our country,states,cities,school's and reading clubs so please don't remove our book's thats all we ask and not only will you make me happy but you'll make our reader's very happy. Thank you for reading this and have a nice day	3	3	3
4443	2	Every individual has their own opinion on censorship. Some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. I'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored.       Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines. Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that arent appropriate for school hours or even in the school building. Schools @MONTH1 not want something inapropriate on their shelves where students can see it. Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools. Younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully. Younger kids, such as elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read.     In public libraries, things are a little different. Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out. Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. If the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book.     A couple of times, I've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense. When I got home and began reading it, it turned out I was wrong. The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read. So, I returned the book to the library. Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book. So, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out.    Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship. I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored. In other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed  to checked out.	4	4	4
4462	2	I believe censorship is necessary. If all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn @DATE1 we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow. It's inmportant that we are held back some what by these offensive outlets in order that we grow into mentally healthy adults. However, censorship can go to far. When it comes to the removing an author's work from a public library altogether, we have crossed the line. With the @CAPS2 given us by our founding fathers, our @CAPS2 given to us at birth, and the duty we have to express our opinion, I submit that it is a crime to remove the hardwork of authors and artists from the shelves.     Of course the first point of argument that comes to mind to defend my postion is the fact that we are all given a legal right to express oursleves through the @NUM1 amendment of our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. The writers of this @CAPS1 were aware that freedom of creativity should not be held back from the people. That law still exists @DATE1 and has been used many times to defend people arguing to keep their work, their words, and their ideas out in the world. As far as I know, taking any form of media, book, or entertainment away from the general public would be illegal. Still, even with this point made, some @MONTH1 not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want.     A man by the name of @PERSON4 comes to my mind when asked about censorship in the media. @PERSON4 was a musician, composer, writer, public speaker, and human @CAPS2 activist. I think many people believe him to be a bit too wild and deranged to be a convincing argument. @PERSON4 was known to be a firm athiest and secular humanist (one who believes that there is nothing more important than the physical human body), but he gave the same argument I'm giving @DATE1, and I'm a catholic. @PERSON4 spoke out against censorship, saying that it was a way to judge artists on their work when it wasn't even listened to fully. If someone as convincing and passionate as @PERSON4 could feel that way when he didn't even believe in a @CAPS4, then everyone should see that the human race, whether they believe in a @CAPS4 or not, is given the right for their creation to be revealed. In some cases, it's necessary and needed for people to show their ideas to the public.     @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON3 even, and the list goes on. These people, although from different worlds and different times and different people, were all avid believers in the @CAPS2 of humans. Imagine if @CAPS3 had just said, 'I don't think people want to hear me so I'll just stop and let someone else take over for a little bit.' Do you think the world would by as amazing and of intergrated as a place? The point is, we never know how great and life-changing someone's point of view could be. Whether it's leading a civil @CAPS2 movement, or attempting to bring peace to a world that needs it the most, censorship might be the one thing from stopping the people from seeing the most influential person that they need.  In fact, we are all called to share our ideas. It's our duty to make sure people see the world not only from their view, but from the view of a poor homeless man, and from a single mother of five, and from a kid in elementary school, and from a rebellious teenager. The world might not be ready for change, but it needs it.     Who's right is it to judge an artist's work? Some call him @CAPS4, some call him the man, and others call him the government. It's hard getting your work acknowledged by someone, let alone a whole nation. However, that doesn't mean we are to just give up. Censorship in public places is a crime against the law, nature, and our inaliable @CAPS2, and it's our job to go out into the world to create a new one.	4	4	4
4463	2	Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future.                 Censorship is extremely dangerous to a soceity because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and many other environmentalist around the globe of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment.                                                                            Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that @MONTH1 cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellilectual. Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The @CAPS5' by @PERSON1, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology.     Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the @LOCATION1 bin @CAPS7 killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 of @ORGANIZATION1, military, and @CAPS9. That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 news. I'd rather of coursebe notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To @CAPS11 a @CAPS12' or '@PERSON3' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it.     Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship..	4	4	4
4482	2	Books, music, movies, magazines, ect. should be remove if they are offensive to a race or any other kinds of belifs unless they are biogical or historical time line.  If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your belifs, you @MONTH1 want to see a libarian and tell what you think about so that the reading material will be remove off the sevles and gone.     I think that if it goes against something in a bad way is should be removed and gone.  I've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff.  I went to the libarian, told her that i wanted this magazine off the shelves.  We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves.       Nobody wants something to go against them in anyway.  Thats way we should have offensive material off our libaries shelves.	3	3	3
4490	2	Censorship can be considered as a major problem.  I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch.  Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend.  Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong.     First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone.  I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today.  So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral.     Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored.  My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses.  If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves.  Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting.     Lastly, censorship is a communist trend.  Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy.  So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race.     So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere.  It is a very communist thing to do.  It infringes our rights.  Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored	3	3	3
4497	2	There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch.     First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it.     Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community.     Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library.      Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them	4	4	4
4527	2	Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways.      As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives.      The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared mevery much so.     Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library.     I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries.	4	3	4
4543	2	People @MONTH1 have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, @CAPS1, etc. Whether those reasons be personal or professional it rather important. Some @MONTH1 find the material offensive to themself. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation. And writing or music could be thought of as unneccessary and irrelevant.     The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone. That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout. Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people. It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song. But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive. They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing. Unless the offender is very public and offends pratically everyone, should it then be removed.     Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened. People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand. Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it.     Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it. If you listen to a @CAPS2 and they singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unneccessary. Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture in inexcusable. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved peoples lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only a little about the person and heard barely any of the story.     In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people.Or if the material can cause problems that should not have started. And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access.	4	4	4
4557	2	Censorship in media has been around since the beginning of @ORGANIZATION1. Some of the first movies were seen as too offensive and never made it to the theatres, but books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries how do they even need to be censored?          Censorship of books should be if a book is not for children keep them away from it. Books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library. A library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment and those very offensive books do not teach learning or are entertaining.          Music is another thing. Most songs out are highly offensive and should be in a different section. They should not be in the kid's area for music because do parents really want their children to learn cuss words at the age of five? Most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether that had to with sex, drugs, and cussing, all things that are censored in the media today. Maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored.     Movies are almost the same as music because it potrays mostly what music has in it, but it is visual. Again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear. Libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library. They should be censored by putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing or put the bar over the person's hand or wherever when they are making an inappropriate gesture.     Over the years it has become harder to censor magazines. Magazines are impossible to censor, unless you are the person receiving the magazine. If you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive. The libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines.     If you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question.	4	4	4
4564	2	Everyone has there own opinions and arguements about something. There are a lot of books that can be offensive to people in some ways. There can be over thousands of books in a library, and I find it difficult sometimes to find that right book that interests me. My personal opinion is that i do not think that books should be removed from a shelf even though it @MONTH1 offend someone.     As I stated in the first paragraph, everyone has there own opinions. There are so many types of books out there from murderes, romance, mysteries, drugs, and many more. These books should be placed in seperate areas just as many books are. If books are taken off a shelf what does that mean to us people? Everyone has there own freedom. So if books are going to be moved from someone that's taking away from are individual freedom.      There are more to books in a libray also. From books, movies, music, magazine, etc., can all of the have different types to them. I do think they should just be placed in different areas. I can see where people think that this can cause an influence to young children if they pick up something that is disturbing, but they should be with an adult. Adults know what is right from wrong than what children do. For example, whenever i walk into public places i hardly every see children just running around especially in libraries. Libraries are expected to be kept quiet and not out jumping around and screaming. The kids should be kept with there parent or an adult that way they can't grab something they shouldn't.     I understand that some teenagers can be offended to drugs or killings, in magazines or books, but some people like reading about that kind of stuff. Does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because one is offended? To many think they have the right to do anything without negociating with others. People that do not like that kind of stuff should just put it back down and go on with what they were doing.I can understand if you think that restrictions should be put on some things because i will agree. There should be sections for teens, adults, and children. To me that does not mean we have to remove anything though from otheres for offending someone.                 Libraries can have an affect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be. You should be able to have freedom without removing anything from anyone. Taking away things does not mean your just taking away from one, it means your taking away from everyone. You can have your own censorship in libraries from your individual freedom. These are my personal views on why things should not be removed from shelves or anything else	3	3	3
4574	2	Where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3     @CAPS4 up noone wanted to read, it's to hard or I don't want to. The best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine. Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public.     We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same way with the media. Books, magazines, @LOCATION1, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best wat to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come.     Censorship @MONTH1 just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. Atleast the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today.     With all of these new @CAPS5 (Music @CAPS6) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on @CAPS6, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like @CAPS5 don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other.     Books are another thing that could use some censorship. @CAPS2 teacher used to tell me, '@CAPS8, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be.     With the world today, it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3	4	4	4
4575	2	Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not.     What is too offinsive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.     If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.     People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways.     All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come.	4	4	4
4577	2	There are many things out in the 'material' world that people take offense to. No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie. But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'. If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material to dish out the same. If they can pull something off the shelves that they 'find offense to', then everyone @CAPS4 a right to. Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch what @CAPS5 it is that they are feeling offends them. It would be that simple, just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie. Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind. It would make everything far less dramatic.      People that say that they have offense to whatever the material @MONTH1 be usually use the phrase '@CAPS1 it's offensive and i don't want my kid to stumble across it.' They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public. They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time! If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then @ORGANIZATION1 (the writer of the song/book/movie) can claim that he @CAPS4 been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a free-for-all for everyone one to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone @CAPS4 the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring @ORGANIZATION1 down, then @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 the right to do the exact same thing. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as @CAPS1 take everything else down with it.     So, if some one finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help. When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the freaking radio to something else! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song? Or if they find a book offensive. Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content? Umm, no. If some one is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty rediculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book that to just change the radio or find a different book. So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there @CAPS4 a right to be sold.     On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold. They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author @CAPS4 written it this way. If they are conflicted by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf. Or if they are listening to the song, listen to it all the way through, or maybe even twice. The artist who sang the song might have been expressing themselves in a very deep way, and if someone pulls their song off the radio or where @CAPS5 it is played, then someone could be offending them in return. Having an open mind will let the so called 'offended person' see a whole other light being shown on why the 'offensive material' was even created. Then everything can stay ON the shelves!     People have opinions, and that is one hundred percent okay. But sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter. If some people get offended (or think they get offended) by something, they would try to removed whatever it was from the nations stores. But if they just sit back and think about it, then it would be okay. If they have a right to remove anything from the shelves, so does everyone. If that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 song really, really offends they, they should just change the radio station and forget about it. And if they have open minds as to why the things are still 'out there', then all the songs, and all the books, and all the movies will still be on the shelves for people to buy. I do not approve of removing anything from stores just because one person feels like if they don't like it, then it absolutly @CAPS4 to go. No, they world doesn't just revolve around one person, and it never, @CAPS5 will.	5	5	5
4578	2	Controversy in the @CAPS1          @CAPS2 someone walks in to there public @CAPS1 they are overwelmed with books. Even though one person could never read that many books, the @CAPS1 has to have a wide selection, for the people that read different thing. The @CAPS1 should not get rid of books that offened some people. the @CAPS1 is a public place that allows people to read what they want. If someone dose not agree to what another person is reading they don have to be there.     Since the @CAPS1 is a public place, and people can not just throw away a book because that is offensive. Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If everyone would throw away books that were offensive, there would be no books left. This would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning.      The public @CAPS1 is open for anybody to read a book. Keeping this in mind the @CAPS1 has to have books that appeal to everyone. If they would only have one type of book, not many people would want go the the @CAPS1. the @CAPS1 has to offened some people to please others.     People who go the @CAPS1 go because it is there choise to go and get a book. If people find the books in the @CAPS1 offensive, they do not have to go. Books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them. If someone finds a book offensive they dont have to read it.     Librarys should have as many books as they can, so they can appeal to every taste. They should not get rid of books that offened a small group of people. Those people do not have to read books that they find offensive. Librarys are a public place for anybody to read what they want.	4	4	4
4583	2	Nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library. America is a free country and we can write whatever we want. Everyone has freedom of speach, your just taking that admendment and putting it into music, books, or a movie. When you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive just put it back on the shelf and move on.     Everyone have seen a lot of things that are offensive to races and beliefs. You hear jokes that are offensive but that is all that it is a joke and it is not to be taken seriously. I have read a book recently called '@CAPS1's your @CAPS2' it was not what I thought it would be, so I just put it down and picked up a different book and kept on reading. If everybody were able to take books out of a library just because it was offensive would we have any books at all? Movies have a protection against this called ratings. The ratings are from '@CAPS3 to @CAPS4.' If the movie you watch is more towards the @CAPS4 section then it will have more offensive language and violent scenes. That is why there is always a blocked off section at a dvd rental store. That section is only for mature people of the ages @NUM1 or older. If by any chance your kid strays in there and finds somthing not suited for him and you really get fired up just think @CAPS1 let him wonder into that section. @CAPS1 should be watching him at all times, @CAPS1 is responsible for him?      I do not agree that reading material or anything in that matter should be taken off of a shelf. Thats like saying if someone did not like how the @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 was worded they could just take it down and throw it away. We would have nothing to read. So the next time you see something that is offensive just put it back and move on	3	3	3
4597	2	BAD @CAPS1     Do you really want your kids to see bad immages or read bad prompts? I dident think so! you can help by teaching them what is right or wrong good or bad. You need to help them have a clere cnochience so when they come across these obsticalls in life they will know what to do.     You could do what my aunt @PERSON1 does. Whenever she goes through the check out ile at a local @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or other stores she turns the magazines that she thinks is innaproperate around. My mom and dad say this is a silent protest, because she is hurting no one else she just simply dosent like it.     It makes my dad upset when ever he watches tella vision with us and thier is some thing that they never saw on @CAPS4  like half naked girls on the comershals so he will turn the channel or shut it off. because he dosent want us exposed the bad thngs of the world.     My mom is the same way but she wont let us watch @NUM1 movies if i wanted to watch thies i was usually at my friends house. My mom would probably be a little upset. I think books are ok because you dont see alot of picture books you have to read them and imagine the image i their head.     In conclusion i hope you would feel the same way i do so next time you go through that check out stop and say to your self do i want little eyes to see this. Then you should turn that maggizne around turn off the @CAPS4 and the music,you should also ead the book so you know what it is  about	3	3	3
4602	2	How many of you out there absolutely love to read? Well, im going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise of any negative books. Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle. One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book. The cover oftens creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea. Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves.          What about the younger children who like to read? Although kids have a wild imaginaion, authors should't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas. First of all, kids now days either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them. Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book it could hurt there feelings. Books are supposed to provide eductional information or be entertaining. They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people.           More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world? Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways. When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are actknowledging bad examples on thier kind, they feel discouraged. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone. When authors, publishers, song writers, or movie producers release these items, they do not think of the surroundings. Thier main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful.           Most importantly, if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate. It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries. A public library which is open to all, should have sections for books, movies, cd's or magazines that are too vivid. There's a wide range of books laying around and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive. I believe they should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not. I've not experienced it yet, but believe me it could happen anytime in our world today. If i was a parent I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library.      Finally, during this debate older or more dirty minded people will counterargue this topic. Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections? Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples? Those are some of the questions you will here for those who counter what I've written today. Adults should be allowed there own personal section for adultlike books, movies, or magazines. Kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them.      In conclusion, those who counterargue could be on the winning side, however I still believe offensive books should be removed from shelves. Book lovers all around the world want enteratinment, but in good ways. The younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way. Furthermore, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and noninfluential books from libraries. Lets make an inference and say, if we work to remove these offensive books, younger children will become more educated.	4	4	4
4607	2	Do yo think censorship is a good thing? Do you think libraries should take more responsability on what they offer to people? Many people think they should. But I disagree, if they dont want to learn about that topic than don't read the book.          Public libraries are a great help for the community. They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home. Libraries do think about what information children view. That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age. Also its not always about what the library displays, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read. If to some people some information is offensive, to others it might not. People will always have different points of view.           This materials cannot be removed, they might be important in some  points of our lifes. All information is helpful in some way. The inmense ammount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone want to	3	3	3
4617	2	Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc.       If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.      I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.      If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book.      Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.      One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.      The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person	4	4	4
4626	2	Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment, for their enjoyment,  to gain personal knowledge and many other reasons. Reading should not be restricted by any means. If a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done.     For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind boggling. I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community. It's not fair to everyone else.     If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read. Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, that is why there are many sections in a library. The sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. That way you are happy and so is everyone else.     Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books. Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it. If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read. Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to.     Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, don't read it. It's that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion.	4	4	4
4641	2	I think if its offensive it should not be avavible for kids intill they are old enough to read it, listen to it. I think they need to be removed from shelves or put away.     Because it can be hurtful, dirty for younger kids and it could be prevented if they are removed from shelves.     I belive the magazines can be put away or put into its own sections. Music or movies could be put in there own sections also. Internet could be blocked for certain websites.     Luckly the time we live in has people to prevent these things to happen like adults. And people to watch you and can tell you you are too young for that stuff.     This is what I think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves. If they are offensive remove them so we dont have to worry if are children are reading them or not.	3	3	3
4642	2	Dear Newspaper,     I would like to start off by sayin that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are great for kids in libraries. It's great that kids have a place to go in there free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read. But some things are not suitable for young kids and young adults.      In high school just walking down the hall you will find out more things than you would probably like to know. Many of them @MONTH1 not be appropriate but whenever you walk into the library its almost as if they are promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex.      Books about drugs are okay to a certain extent, like if they are medicinal drugs. But whenever they are talking about how drugs take the pain away and make everything better, thats when its taken to far. Our kids and future kids do not need to be learning about these sort of things.     Alcohol is the same way. You see alcohol everywhere and kids are doing it at a young age because movies, music, books, etc. are promoting it basically. Our kids do not need to be learning about these sorts of things. We need them to learn about the dangers of alcohol, not how to get drunk and what you do when your drunk.     Advertsements are the worst things that kids could be seeing especially when they are on billbords, fronts of magazines, etc. Kids do not need to be learning these things at such a young age. Kids should be persuaded to play outside and be in sports and have fun with the family or ride there bike.     I feel that these things should be taken out of libraries if they are offensive to some people. Because maybe its for the best that these things are taken off shelves beacuse maybe our kids will be healthier and live longer without being influenced or under pressure about doing drugs and alcohol, etc.                                             Sincerely,                                                           @PERSON1	3	3	3
4643	2	I am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries. Some people think books, music, movies, magazines,etc., are offensive. Those things might be offensive to them, but not to other people. So you have to look at it in not only your point of view but other people point of view.          I think they should not remove these things from the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view like my mom for instence she likes vampire books and movies, but i like tragedy. See everyone likes something different. They also have to think to the books we have from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM2, etc., are offensive to some people. Are we going to take those books out to.          I mean if we took books, music, movies, magazines, etc., out for being offensive then we would not have any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Everyone thinks something offensive, some might think the same thing is offensive some might thing something different is offenseive. We should not take books, music, movies, magazines, etc., off the shevles.     I understand that people do not want there kids to see them or hear them. It part of life though. You can not take everything out to please one person, because it could make another person mad	3	3	3
4652	2	Censorship to most people means much more than the average @NUM1 syllable word. It means giving up the right to say and think however you want. To most, this idea is not a good one. When one is censored, they are essentially giving up the right of freedom of @CAPS3. In this essay I will discuss three cons of censorship in libraries.     One reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of @CAPS3. Decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was aloud to practice their right to speak freely, the idea of censorship was not in the plan. As @CAPS1's, it is our right to speak and write however we want without reprocussions, however offensive or non-offensive the material @MONTH1 be. As @CAPS1's all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another. Does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive, then an item should be taken off shelves? Absolutley not. Freedom of @CAPS3 is our birth right and we should be aloud to say or write anything without being censored.     '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson. Author Katherine Paterson simply states that if she has the right to take any book of the shelf that she doesn't like, then everyone else also has that same right. As previously stated in the paragraph above, it makes no sense to rid a book just because one person finds it offensive. If that was the case, I could find @NUM2 books in our library that I find offensive, and the next person could find @NUM3 books that are offensive and so on. Just as Katherine states, 'And then we have no books left on the shelves for any of us.'     And the last con of censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning a book brings. As an avid book reader, I couldn't even begin to describe all of the vocabulary words and new things I learn from reading one book. Just recently I read the book @CAPS4 @CAPS5. As I was reading, I began to have a deep hatred of the main character. Later I found that the book was incredibly offensive. However, from reading it, the book provided much insight into @DATE1's life that I new nothing about. It gave me a great deal of information that to this day, I use. The book made me reflect on myself and how @NUM4 plus years changes people, @CAPS1's more specifically.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a good idea. When one is censored they give up their right of freedom of @CAPS3, other books in general, and loss of oppotunity to learn new things. Hopefully with this essay, I have persuaded you or at least informed you on the cons of censorship in libraries	4	4	4

4658	2	Hello @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive. i have a broad view on this subject. My view is just that if the censor stuff in a library, the should censor tv.     I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house. Everyday I see bad language thats inot censored. I also have seen images that are not censored. The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library. So why not censor tv. I see things on tv that i wont see in a library.     In my conclusion i would like to say i dont believe that libraries should censor their materials because the studdent will still find out. There are plenty of other places that are worse. Like crimes scenes, cime scens have blood and gore and a library would just have language. These are my views ancd yours could be differnt.	3	3	3
4670	2	Yes I do believe that certain books, movies, music, etc., should be removed. They should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area. Because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior.        In order to keep the objects from being found from childern is to set them in a different area. Some where childern are unable to reach. like in high areas like the top of the shelf, or the closet, maybe the attic. For better safe keepings place the certain objects you feel that can give childern bad ideas in a personal safe. where no one is able to get things out.         It is important for some items to be seen, listened to, or watched for older people.For example, books can provide pictures for childern to do things that arn't right in there cerent age. Music can talk about stuff that that person done, and make that child want to do it because they might think its cool cause the artist does it. For the magazines they show articals of rapper, actors, and other famous people doing somthing wrong. showing a bad example for the child.Now for the materials they should be hidden in a place where no child would think to look at. Because the materials some times harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital.    From experience I have thouched or took some material I shouldn't have messed with and the outcome wasn't good. From that experience I've learned not to thouch with items I know not to mess with.     Thats why it is important to keep certain items from childern. Because the outcome maynot be what you wanted. serious actions might come from the objects, and later on come from the same child that either listed to, saw it, or looked at it. So make sure the items are safe from childern hands	3	3	3
4680	2	Censorship in Libraries     Have you ever came across something in the library that makes you say, ' @CAPS1! That's inappropriate!' If so, I am sure your not alone. Just the other day I was in the library. There were posters up all around featuring a new movie now avalible for rental. I remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive. How could they allow this kind of thing on display like this? How does this affect the minds of our country's youth?     My thought on this topic is clear, although I am sure I'd recieve some opposition from others, considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter. I do realize the library has age limits on rentals, but what about all these posters everywhere? You don't necessarily have to rent the material to be corrupted by it. I believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material.     Another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are @CAPS2. New music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. Even the covers of some @CAPS2 should be removed for the good of the public. It's interesting how these things just slide by the library. I once saw a young by renting a @CAPS4 that had the words 'parental advisory' right on the cover! No one stopped him.     Books are the same way. Disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library. No one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves.     So, when do you think someone's going to do something about censorship in libraries? It is hard to say, but I strongly believe it's up to protesters like us to stop this. I hope you'll join me in this epic battle for censorship, to keep our youth safe	4	4	4
4681	2	I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action. There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others. I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. For example: @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to some people is very offensive. The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life.     I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended. Books about war to some people are too graffic. But those books about war are probably books about history. I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. But back in the @DATE1's people didn't care about what was in a library. They just want something to read. I say leave the librarys alone!	3	3	3
4696	2	Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc. People have differnt views on differnt things.     Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too	3	3	3
4697	2	I am a student from @CAPS1. I wanted to let you know  that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read from the schools library and the public library as well. The only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books. Not only that but I've also seen books that are not appropriate for children to be reading. I just wanted to let you know this because I was kind of thinking that taking books out wouldn't be a good idea for them to do. I think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn.      To begin with, I wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me. One of them was that at the school there had not been good books to read and that they want to take most of them out and replace them with the ones they like. I was thinking that if they did that they would be the only ones to go to the library because it is only there choice and not everyones. So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books students won't be going to the library. If they don't get books then they won't do well in school which is something that will affect the school.     Furthermore about the complaints was that one of my own family member had seen  a young girl looking at a book that was not appropriate for her at the public library. So instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in. They should do that because if it were to be taken out then that book wouldn't ever be used again. Also another reason is that If they were to be taken out, then another peson might need information over the topic of the book and wouldn't be able to find it because it isn't there. That is why I thing those types of books should be in a special room intead of them being taken out.     Finally, as I had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important. That is why I go against taking books out that are not favored by others. If a person doesn't like a certain book/ magazine  then they should just request the book/ magazie that they want to read. By doing that then the book that arn't being used could actually be used by someone else that is intersted in it. So if we keep all our book, then more students and people would go and read.      In conclusion, people might say that taking out book is better than keeping them. Well in the way I see it, they are wrong because keeping them is better. It is better because  someday those books can be useful nomatter how old they are. If they were inappropriate books like metioned earlier, they should be put away in a good place. If there arn't enough interesing ones then requesting one is another way to do it. That is why I think that taking out books from the shelves is wrong and they should do watever in order to not let books go to waist	4	4	4
4705	2	Certain material that are made to offend people should be removed from shelves everywhere. I am against any material that are offensive to someone or something else. The three main reasons I am against this is because it is wrong to offend others, offending others can lead to personal issues, and offending others or something else will eventually tire out.           To simply write a book or a magazine, or make a movie just to offend someone or something is wrong. People should always treat others the way that they would like to be treated. For someone to make negative lyrics about a person or something says something about the person who made that song. Maybe that person has personal issues. In order for that person to ignore their personal issues, they make fun of someone else.     Offending other people can lead to personal problems. How? If someone steadily talks about you or, on a daily basis, offends you, people can get depressed. They can start believing that they are nothing. I remember a girl in the eighth grade told everyone that I was a 'garden tool' and that I would do anything for a piece of change. She also made a song, taunting me everyday about how I looked. She actually recorded it and passed it out at school. People heard it, and like followers, they started taunting me, too. I soon became depressed. I got so bad to the point that I was suicidal. I thought the world would be a better place without me. I had to go see a shrink to get over those thoughts. What other people do to you or say about you can have a bad effect on them.       Last but not least, people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone. The victim will get tired of being teased or talked about. People would stop listening to that negative garbage. If people stop supporting that degrading stuff, then the author wouldn't have anything to write about. The singer wouldn't have anything to sing about. Their career will have gone down the drain because there is no future in offending others.     There are many reasons why offensive materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries, stores, and everywhere else. These negative comments will get nowhere in life. As I brought out in my body, it's simply wrong to offend others, it can lead to personal issues, and it will eventually tire out or get old. Nothing good comes from making people feel bad. So once again, these negative materials should be abolished everywhere.	4	4	4
4717	2	I think that no books should be taken away. I think that if a aduld or a child wants to look at something or read about something they should have the right to. If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they cant because the song has curse words in it they should be allowed to. And if it bothers someone the bothered person can leave.          If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inapropiate who cares. And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they cant because it's to violent so the library doesn't have it. I think librarys should be able to have whatever inventory they want. And if it's to violent or if the music is to dirty just don't let children get a hold of it.	2	2	2
4722	2	In our socioty, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive.     People have the right to pick something up, over look it, and decide wheither it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made.     I agree, somethings are offensive, but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it, then dont let it bother you. I believe that music is a way that people express themselves. I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. If the material is to graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just should do it.	2	2	2
4728	2	I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things.      Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it.     Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics. Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials.     Another factors is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf.     I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials. If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.     I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some.	4	4	4
4751	2	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' @CAPS1 repeats it's self, and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south.      What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened. And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.     The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical.          Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex? @CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.     It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors. If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman	4	4	4
5982	3	The setting effects the cyclist because of the setting were diffrent the story would not of made sense. The setting of the story is not and dry with scaterd ghost towns. When he reaches the first town he sees One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule. If the setting had the problem of no water so there would be no conflict in the story, In the story the speeker says I was travling through the high deserts of California that are very hot and dry, and he says This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the seting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldnt have as much of a problem needing water which would of made the story much less exciting.	2	2	2
5987	3	In the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, the sun was beginning to beat down. @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drains a persons energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskies story, Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  	2	3	3
5992	3	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.	1	1	1
5996	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you.	1	1	1
6041	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough. If he gos too pot he could spin out of commission and the water was trouble. He sad when I tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid.	2	1	2
6051	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty . I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding	1	1	1
6060	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they cant just road. Stight so they need to go over the hilles and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land form a jump.	1	1	1
6076	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobodys there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore hes in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobodys around town in able to help him out or anything. Lets say that he gets lost and hell need direction to get wherever hes going well theres nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. 	1	2	2
6109	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town. For example his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by cautiousness of the new, of the new road he went on then terror when he thought he was gonna die  I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean then to pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says I own a very good map But as he journeys to Yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a  desert type of place then goes a bait shop to rest. Then probably on his merry way to his destination.	2	2	2
6112	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was long and a                The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the tempeture was	1	1	1
6114	3	The different settings that the cyclist had to ??? were mountains or hills winding roads and California desert in June. As well as he was running out of water.	1	1	1
6124	3	Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth, this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2	3	3
6143	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says  The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June. A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was dont ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3	2	3
6145	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water hell have later on. As he passes a snake, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, I could drop from heatstroke meaning hes starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because hes beginning to loose hope and  thinks hes not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2	3	3
6152	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill... This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2	2
6173	3	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said I wipe the sweat from my eyes.	1	1	1
6175	3	"In the setting of  Rough road ahead: do non excee posted speed limit. The cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning the authour is enjoying a nice campground outside lodi California when old-timers told the cyclist directions and from his piont of view  ""they'd  sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off out land marks and spouting off towns  I would come to along this breezy aunt. So the cyclist used that information and it wasnt for   The Better."	1	1	1
6187	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it.	1	1	1
6200	3	The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obsticles in his journey but he still made it. Nature was most definatly not on his side that day. He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, After he got threw the hills, he came to a sigh  ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.  Now he has to go through bumply roads. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him! Thankfully he got by the snake, alive. Over one long cripping hill, a building came into view. The man thinks he found someplace to get water, but its an abonded building . ...,by the looks of it  and been a welchs grape Juice Factory and botting plant..	0	0	0
6234	3	The feature of setting affect the cyclists because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to where about falling of your bike, or out of water. I you keep at a fast past and dont have any water then you can get dehydrated. In the essay it tells how he had ran out of water and he thout he was going to die he had gotten dehydrated but lukly he had find some were to get something to drink	1	1	1
6236	3	The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting. At first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a ghost town. He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait. The bikers feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did.	2	2	2
6240	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says,  and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance. The setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure.	2	3	3
6254	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. This site was trebling.  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isnt good. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he cant believe his luck. Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks.	3	2	3
6261	3	 In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling through the high deserts of California in June(Kurmaskie). This affect would mean that the author would be dehydrated faster. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town because he gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouth(Kurmaskie).	1	1	1
6264	3	"The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now behind him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclists physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclists physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."	3	3	3
6272	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. One way was because of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With the cyclist having limited amount of water effected him to. The cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. So that made matters bad. With having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder, First he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought.	2	2	2
6295	3	The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun, no trees, and no water. The cyclist was also feeling lesy. In the story he said I and the growing ??? :??? That I could drop from heat stroke.	1	2	2
6297	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.	1	1	1
6302	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, The sun was beginning to beat down This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun ??? him hard. Also when he states I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph, this shows he was also dehydrated once goin, very slow because of the ammount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area.	2	2	2
6310	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because its almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. Hes showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much hes indespair at the time. When he says It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows hes not in a good shape and he knows hes in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.	2	3	3
6320	3	@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said , Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit. @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist.	1	1	1
6338	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is neccesary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal. For  example, the text says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tentalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatsroke on a gorgeouse day in June."" @CAPS1, by usings vocubulary such as ""tentalizing"" expresses the cyclist need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence the narrator make a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for them suggesting the path. Readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist"	2	2	2
6350	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind (kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water.	2	1	2
6366	3	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states with strong legs and a smile on my face. As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.	3	3	3
6371	3	"In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting.   "	3	3	3
6375	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist grate deal. For example, it was not and hill goet dehydrated. He went down this rusty-bumpy road, which didnt help his dehygration And another example would be he found a plane was he could set a change and find the best way to get where he was going. That the features on the setting affection the cyclist.	1	1	1
6382	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.	1	1	1
6383	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, short, rolling hills, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isnt much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.	2	2	2
6409	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town	2	2	2
6425	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. I maneuvered down the hill. This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way.	2	1	2
6436	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.         	2	1	2
6437	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need alot of water. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" Then the terrain in changes when he says Flat road was replaced "	1	2	2
6444	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old mens town was now abandoned. (the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a sad, hopeless laugh. The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3	3	3
6453	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6466	3	The cyclist in Rough road Ahead was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 its usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isnt an easy trick.	1	2	2
6477	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction arent so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. There were rusted water pumps, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.	2	2	2
6483	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement I was travelling through the high deserts of California. not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement I was travelling in June. @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also had the flavor of battery acid. This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly. The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.	3	3	3
6499	3	The features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. That effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to Yosemite slower because he needs to find water. That is a feature that affects the cyclist	1	1	1
6513	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie). This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his shortcut his running out of water. Thats when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.	2	2	2
6535	3	The feature of the cyclist and the settings arnt that good. Therere insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldnt have any energic to get up. Therere some interesting sence in the story.	2	2	2
6546	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the author tells a story about when he took advice from old folks and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake and a crippling hill these quotes explain that the setting was quite scary.	1	1	1
6555	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town. The old people in the didnt know they were tell him. It made it haede for nam because that more harder roads and lesort water. He almost died.	1	1	1
6592	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. A rediculously large snake this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature. I could drop from heat stroke another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is. The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips. This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3	2	3
6599	3	First, by accepting the old mens advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a ghost town, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like battery acid. Next he rides past a Rough Road Ahead sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at Gary and Wilbers Fish Camp. To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2	3	3
6611	3	The features of the cyclist is rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, amount of water. The hills give you a breeze going down but going up give you a hard time. The snakes can hurt you by bitting. The heat could make you sick. The amount of water can really hurt you by being dehydrated.	1	1	1
6620	3	The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle.	1	1	1
6622	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldnt find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didnt know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
6662	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and Gary and Wilbers Fish Camp, greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left wide rings of dried sweat on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees and had the flavor of battery acid prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a dehydrated state. @CAPS1, Gary and Wilbers Fish Camp affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.	2	2	2
6667	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuious setting to have to bike with. I would never be able to do what he did.	1	1	1
6699	3	"The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit The cycleist had beed going for a very long time when he came to the first town and there was no water At this point you can tell that he has lost confidence the old timers"" directions. From this quote; a ton-like substance oozed out. This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, I hung my head this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."	3	3	3
6704	3	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from Flat read, (Kurmaskie) to short, rolling hills (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.	2	2	2
6705	3	The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	3	3
6713	3	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.	2	1	2
6716	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesnt allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 sees it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesnt receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp. @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."	3	3	3
6725	3	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake.	1	1	1
6735	3	When riding a bike it @MONTH1 not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.	2	3	3
6739	3	"The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist. In good way and a bad way."	1	1	1
6747	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California. This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	2	2	2
6748	3	Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes hes experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old codgers  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel. Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        	3	2	3
6773	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6794	3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story after the cyclist had Been rideing a long time it says I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip	2	3	3
6795	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that it rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.	1	1	1
6806	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says flat roads were replace by short rolling hills, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says, the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement. The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says no one in sight, no building, car, or structure, he is affected because he cant ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.	1	2	2
6813	3	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills. He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldnt be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didnt show the terrain change at all.	1	1	1
6824	3	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.	1	1	1
6837	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water.	1	1	1
6843	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.	1	1	1
6898	3	"I think the features in the setting of the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied a information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is not because the text says,""somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees."" This implies that it is very hot outside. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""This shows that the people in towns didnn't help him. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a shake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. ""This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road. You know there is a shake because the text says, ""and rediculously large snake blocked the majority of the road. I think there are many implied t expressed information in the story""do not exceed the speed limit. "	3	2	3
6919	3	At First the narrator in Do not Exceed  Posted Speed limit was energetic enthusiastic  about their journey to Yosemite national Park .After getting some helpful advice about a few short cuts the cyclist sets out for adventure .First thing they encounter is ghost town .The gentlemen they a taken advice from had assured them it was booming prosperous town .This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist mind .Then lack of water began .They were travelling through the high desserts of California in June and slowly running out of water .Flat road was soon replaced by short , rolling hills which only increased the cyclist state deliriousness .After a few more dissapointments the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die .The reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist .All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you cant stop reading because you have to find out what happens.If it werent for the hopelessness of the setting you wouldnt care.	3	2	3
6923	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldnt ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didnt help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldnt be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.	3	3	3
6926	3	Do not Exceed the posted speed limit tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of the serenity of an early summer evening, and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the town he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclists change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3	3
6928	3	The features of the setting affect. Any cyclist   because with the cyclist passed many time in the bicycle had problem on his/her back  when he/she will be older. When they will be a older person and they had passed many time in the bicycle, they will had a serious problems and also they will can not walk  more.	0	0	0
6949	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a run-down rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3	3	3
6968	3	The authors setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclists location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since hes traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a persons body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3	2	3
7003	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first town he found he described as a ghost town It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasnt helping either. The terrain really affected the ?? he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the ?? which  ?? him it could have ?? The features of the getting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways	3	2	3
7006	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.	1	1	1
7008	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were I was going to die. First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilbers Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.	1	1	1
7021	3	In the short story Rough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit , The cyclist faced many difficulties .These difficulties were the result of the setting .The story takes place in the high deserts of California in June  .Because the month June is very warm , and the climate of California is usually hot and dry ,the cyclist ran into problems .Not only did this affect the cyclist , but he travelling through the desert .The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way , which contributed to the problem .The cyclistsoon ran out of water , and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied .He had no choice but to continue with his the journey .	2	3	3
7028	3	The setting in the story Do not exceed posted speed limit affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how hes going to die. He shows that hes lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from old-timers who havent left their porches since Carter was in office. In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.	3	2	3
7030	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. ... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1	1
7031	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasnt what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1	1
7032	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, Id be fine, By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs.	2	2	2
7048	3	The features of the setting is very important for cyclist. If the setting is wrong they could be in many danger. It is really important to have a clear setting.	1	1	1
7076	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If its too hot, youre going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If its all down hill, its really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist	2	1	2
7086	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world.	1	1	1
7090	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist dont find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.	1	1	1
7093	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.	1	1	1
7105	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways The woman who had listen to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback (@NUM1). She started to see things that wasnt there.	1	1	1
7113	3	The cyclist in the story rough road ahead Do not exeed posted speed limit, by Joe kurmashie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the shorecay that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: It really didnt matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean. This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless.	2	2	2
7133	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist.	2	2	2
7147	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water to feel sorry for himself The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to rolling hills. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2	3
7150	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles	1	1	1
7159	3	In the story Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didnt have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3	3
7182	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind. This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, battery acid, that he wouldnt last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 	1	1	1
7192	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.	0	0	0
7209	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the short cut that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive.	3	2	3
7213	3	I belive the setting of an area can affect the mind when put is certin situations. In the reading the man is cycling and he sees no one, he is almost out of water and cant se a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives te feeling of helplessness but if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street and cars he would be calmer he could get water at only building along his ride the tempature would be cold there far he would drink less and go further. This would have changed his mood.	1	1	1
7227	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclists job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings.	1	1	1
7238	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. It also says, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.	1	1	1
7258	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting is described as a rough terrain, which makes it harder for the cyclist to travel. Also its hot, and there are no buildings or people around. This also makes it hard for the cyclist because he runs out of water. throught the story the cyclist keeps going and ends up sarving	1	1	1
7266	3	In the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an Ghost town with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he	2	2	2
7268	3	In the passage Do not exceed posted speed limit, there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake, I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that.	1	1	1
7278	3	"In the short story Do not exeed the speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilberss fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California."	2	2	2
7284	3	"In this story the cyclest was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained of boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle. This was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways."	3	2	3
7287	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke.	2	2	2
7290	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if their going down hill then they really only need to know how to control the bike. If their going up a mountain with lots of bumps they need to have some skill. Usually if their riding in a shady area then the wear clothes to keep them cool. But if their going to be in the sun the they need to wear light clothes. The setting affects the rider very much.	1	1	1
7298	3	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt. By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didnt help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was water depleting @NUM2.	2	1	2
7299	3	The features  of the   setting   does   affect the cyclist. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7301	3	"The features of the setting stronger, effect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The features of the land;in, and hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in the middle of june also effect this story.The dry and hills land is a huge factor for the main character. Because if is hilly, he has to work twice as hard. The land is dry, so he his thirsty and has no where to get anything to drink.The land is also desert, so there is no where he can go for help or to get food, water, or civilization. He believes that he is not going to make it. The text explains in paragraph !!, "" the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a goregous day on June simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh"" The setting plays a huge role in the story. It is hot, dry, and deserted this out effects the main character and journey."	3	3	3
7306	3	In this story the setting has a affect to the cyclist trip and to him self. It being hot and over @NUM1 degrees and going down hill with a lot of turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that hes water is no longer cold. Being in this desert is killing and about to make him have a heartstoke. All the things in the desert is doing a lot affect to the cyclist.	1	1	1
7309	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much discribes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesnt change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.	2	3	3
7315	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers shortcut as he states that things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. But what he didnt know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first town which was a ghost town. He wasnt overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting.	3	3	3
7328	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. @CAPS1 basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because hes alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit @CAPS1 pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen.	1	1	1
7346	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushs through and survives.	1	1	1
7367	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says neihbor hood of two hundred degrees. He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.	1	1	1
7376	3	Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesnt have good water, when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, in my dehydrated state (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him.	2	2	2
7397	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination.	2	1	2
7406	3	The setting of this short story affects the cyclist by making him dehydrated and dies. Also in the setting he found the abandon factory which makes him feel hopeless. If the setting was elsewhere then this setting he would have felt different as he didnt  meet the people  of the reserve he could have been in the better roads than the old roads he was in	1	1	1
7408	3	"The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly, first he statrs off happy because hes going to Yosemite national park and hed gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs, Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welchs grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old mans there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it."	1	1	1
7409	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesnt have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. This statement proves that the cyclist wasnt a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that arent there, but you want to see those things.  I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. It was a good decision that the cyclist didnt get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.	2	2	2
7418	3	The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she caldnt go as fast, The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph, so that affected his ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going. For example, I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldnt cool down. @CAPS1 how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist mind. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump. The desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function.  	2	2	2
7427	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by for the roads and heat has. He has tine ling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, @CAPS1 that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder.  The @CAPS1 had to prit more effort into it because the romds here long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He @CAPS1 ran into a snake which told him that I am getting deeper into the desert.	2	2	2
7439	3	In the Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After he first journied from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. Soon, though the terrain changed. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion.	2	2	2
7441	3	Seting is one of the most important neds for a cyclist if the terrein or weather are bad, the hotter it is for a cylist its ?? ??	1	1	1
7443	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY IT BEING SO HOT OUTSIDE THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD PASSED OUT AND DIED. ALSO HE SAW A SNAKE THAT SCARED HIM TO DEATH BUT HE PASSED THE SNAKE. ALSO HE SAW A BUILDING THAT COULD PROBABLY HELP HIM BUT IT WAS ABANDONED,IT WAS A WELCH FACTORY THEN AS HE RUNS FURTHER DOWN HE SAW A FISH PLACE AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO GET SOME WATER then somebody asked him where he was going and they tined totzy him but he still had his map so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people.	2	3	3
7444	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didnt help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found several rusty pumps, and one ramshackle shed. This probably didnt help him because he didnt have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldnt get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldnt setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story Rough road ahead the setting in the story didnt help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didnt help that he was in a desert.	3	3	3
7447	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in the many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandond so he could not get any food or water. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the land was hot and dry wich was making him dehidrated. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist. 	1	1	1
7449	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the syclist states he enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. The cyclist was enjoying himself and the  atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by @CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilbers Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom foucets @CAPS1 was then followed by satisfaction when he promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future.   	2	3	3
7452	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely, and requiring like to drink more water. When no one else was around, it is more difficult for him to continue, if theres a chance that he is on the wrong path, and no body available to tell him otherwise. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was unavailable, which made the journey more tiring and physically straining. If the setting were different, this story would not have been as traumatic.	2	2	2
7454	3	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they wont get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be Never accept to	1	1	1
7455	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadnt taken the shortcut that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.	2	3	3
7465	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. He becomes delusional when he said that  if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat. Also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town.	2	2	2
7467	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "	3	2	3
7470	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water because he is trying to traverse the terrain. In the setting there is a desert in California that he is riding through on a bike, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California The word ""high"" means that there were hills which would make the journey even more difficult. The hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. When the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain. another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses other hills, tumbleweeds crossed in path. The tumbleweeds made him remember he was in the desert because tumbleweeds are associated with the desert which brought up the thought & dying and being picked apart by birds."	2	2	2
7475	3	"In Joe Kurmaskies Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The terrain has a great deal to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist because there is alot of hills. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. That is how the features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist. The terrain affects the cyclist because of the hills. The heat because it drains your energy quick. "	2	2	2
7485	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. For example, he finds a ramshackle shed and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.	1	1	1
7500	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people that never get out of the house. For example in the story it says, Never accept travel advice from collection of old. times who havent left confines of their porches since carter was in office. This affecting the setting because if it werent for his map and let them take a peek at it, That would of saved him a load of trouble.	1	1	1
7517	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in manyway. The hills are to long. Every town is fear appert and the rodes are rought. The heat also affectes him. He is affected health wise.	1	1	1
7537	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water	1	1	1
7561	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discoveraged. For example the cyclist observes, ""one ramshacure shed, several rusty pumps, and a comes that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then youknow that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclistand now the setting around him affects his journey."	2	3	3
7568	3	The setting of Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit effects the cyclist in many was. The words high deserts of California in June, from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist get's very tired and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you dont have water you dont have anything. Also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on, over and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said Rough Road Ahead. There were also obsticals such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger, but because of dedication he got through it.	2	2	2
7570	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going up hill. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them. The heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey.	2	2	2
7573	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing. If the road was bumpy, hed jump up and down a little. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark. If he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright.	1	1	1
7588	3	The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite park he listened to the old timers who havent left the confines of thier porches since Carter was in office. He went the way the old men told him to take. He went down a hill in to town which was empty into a hard road & snakes in his way then up a hill then went down the hill saw a abanded Welchs Grape Juice Factory. Then he saw a sign say Gary And Wilbers FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WERE YOUR BEST BET!. So then he runs into the bathroom & drinks from the sink. Before he got there he was getting thirsty & tired & when he saw the abanded building he saw a young boy drinking a juice he wiped his eyes to see if he wasnt seen a mirage. So then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth. It read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left then a stone went his throat. His troubles, thirst, & fear were all behind him when he saw that sign.	2	2	2
7592	3	The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distrought. He  sees the sign that sats  Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limit it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him. Also, when the rider says  In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing.	1	1	1
7608	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesnt have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.	1	1	1
7642	3	The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first town and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it. His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like rushing being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isnt what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said over the long crippling hill, a building came into view. It is at this point that he uses the word crippling because he is just about exhausted and cant go any further.	2	2	2
7645	3	The location of a cyclists ride affects the persons attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked brackish. So, setting can break a cyclist.	2	2	2
7650	3	The setting of the story had effected the cycles becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    	1	1	1
7655	3	There are many things that could affect affect the cyclist. Like when they said , tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake. @CAPS1 her example would be when they said Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7658	3	The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasnt on is side thats for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didnt want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home.	2	1	2
7659	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind, If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but Im glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.	2	2	2
7672	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, had been do @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen."" This affected the author mentally, making him remember he had no water. Which inturn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like ""battery acid"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state. This setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and had they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is adised in and how it makes them who they are."	3	2	3
7683	3	In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting.	2	2	2
7701	3	It give him a hard time so he learn a lot of thing from that he know that it not always easy. It not abig problem but sometime some small problem become bigger life is like riding bike you have any down some time have problem sometimes lost but that is life.	0	0	0
8875	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when every thing starts coming back she will take the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this parigraph	1	1	1
8881	4	"the author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels she is similar to the geese. For example, Saeng says I-I failed the test. She has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to take that test again."" @CAPS1, Saeng says,"" And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar, too, while describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to take the test again. Finally, at one point Saeng thinks to herself, ""the quiet repetition of season opon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. Saeng feels similar to the geese in this way and this allows her to decide to take the test  when the snow melts and the geese return. The author concludes the story strongly, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her and she feels similar to the geese."	2	3	3
8882	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will be reminded of her homeland and going home. The reason I say that is because the geese are returning home and she wants to. Also the hibiscus will be budding in the wild just like back home	1	1	1
8901	4	the author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She says that she much rather do gardening then school work. She loves planting new things.	0	0	0
8904	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. Narrator says A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden @CAPS2 is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also says, Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now, @CAPS2 proves that the geese symbolize @CAPS3 home also.     	2	2	2
8906	4	"The author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story. when she says ""when the snow melts and the geese return"", she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky"". She went through a change, much like the geese do every winter. She realizes ""that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befere had become...familiar to her now"". We all have to go through changes, Saeng just had a bigger one. "	1	2	2
8908	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng is respectful and how her feelings miss her homeland. First example when Saeng vowed silently to herself it shows how she respect and miss her homeland. It tells that she want to try again about her failure in the past. The last example when she want to overcome her failure in the past. The last line of the paragraph say then I will take that test again. It says she want another. Chance on her life. These are the example of the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1	1
8915	4	I think that the included that because she is compareing her slef as a flower. When she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test. Shes saying there always a second chance. She want to tell everyone that its to miss or a misake. For an example they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up seson.	2	1	2
8947	4	I think the author concludes the story with that ParagraPh to say that he will @CAPS1 uP in sPring time when the snow melts and geese return. Also I think that the author like the setting of sPring also to see the sunny skies a geese floating in a @CAPS2. I also would like that setting because It gives me more ideas and it's a very lovely setting to be around. That is why I think the author Picked that ParagraPh to conclude the story.	0	0	0
8959	4	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didnt want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life.	3	2	3
8969	4	Hope, positivness, helpful all are reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives the readers a sense that Saeng has hope. I felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again. Since she is going to take the test again she wants to  help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So she is re-taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful.	2	2	2
8999	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to show Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author wants to leave Saeng on a good note so she wont be sad. When she takes the test again shell be better prepared and know what shes expecting. Shell have a better winter.	1	1	1
9009	4	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The author chose because the sentence informs you Saeng will take the test agin. In paragraph @NUM1 Saeng tells her mother she faild the test. So by the time spring comes around the hibiscus will start budding and Saeng will retake the test. Also the geese left the home temporally because of snow. So she sort of compares herself to the geese because she missis her home. The geese will return when the time is right, that is what the author concludes in the storys paragraph.	2	1	2
9010	4	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represent to being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng a good luck for her next driving test after winter season uhen the hibiscus is budding. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence to show what her plan for the future	1	1	1
9015	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    	1	1	1
9028	4	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because her wants to let reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget. And also that all this will happen again.	1	1	1
9029	4	The author concludes the ending as I will take that test again meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding she is thinking of the feature and how she saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She cant wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come.	2	2	2
9030	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.	0	0	0
9043	4	The last paragraph states in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass.	1	2	2
9068	4	The author concludes the story like this because the seasons are changing and there finising there cycle and starting a new one. Thus I think this is a good way to end a story like this because I kinda sets a mood and a feel at the end of the story.	1	1	1
9069	4	The author concludes the story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changed in life. So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasnt full adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesnt give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought.	3	2	3
9095	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is more will power because she loves the hibiscus and what other way to end the story that have her comparing he self to the hibiscus because when she say  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus. So the fail is slowing her down. So she is going to be reading to prepare for when the spring comes when the hibiscus is budding then she will be budding too by passing her test.	1	2	2
9117	4	The aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph. In same ways. One reason why the aurthor concluded the story with this paragraph is because in the story she sad something she really wanted. So she took it home and showed her mom, Then her mom look at her weird, because in the story it said that you what? Her mother stared at her increously. So then she explains that she failed the drivers test, but she didnt give up. So at the end of the story she said that she will take that test again. So in conclusion that is why the aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	2	2
9124	4	well It seems like to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because basically to have sarcaism and put emphesis on what he was saying and making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if some one would haft to kill him in order to make him take that test again.	0	0	0
9139	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1.	1	1	1
9145	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""Id love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."	1	2	2
9146	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of Winter Hibiscus means and this is why the author concluded it this way.	1	1	1
9184	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus makes her comfort, she says when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Since the author failed the test as it is told in the story, she will feel comfort taking the test again when the hibiscus come again after the snow season.   	1	1	1
9192	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season.	1	1	1
9202	4	"Saeng is talking about flowers coming back in the spring time. She is vowing to take the test again after the snow is gone and she is going to do it agin. The wind was blowing harder, tearing of the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing."" So she cant wait until it is spring agin. So she can try to plant agin."	0	0	0
9205	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didnt like it because I didnt have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story.	1	1	1
9214	4	The author concludes the story with, when they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, to show that even though she failed her test she isnt giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saengs heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.	1	1	1
9215	4	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says,  and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. 	2	2	2
9233	4	He want to learn hibiscus spirits. Don't be afraid of fare. You just keep ahead, continuly to learn what you want, then you will success. like hibiscus has strong alive: fight with evironment. So, the author use this paragraph to conclude, the purpose is the Saeng will take this test again, like hibiscus will budding when spring's come	1	1	1
9246	4	It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else.	0	0	0
9273	4	This saying is saying that the snow has already fallen down onto their garden and when the snow melts, they will have to recrop everything again. This is a perfect conclusion to end this story. The story is talking about how the flowers grow in the spring and how saengs mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden. So since it snowed and their would be a while before the spring come back. Saeng has alot of planning to do in the next spring. The hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return.	0	0	0
9282	4	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didnt feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way.	2	1	2
9283	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed. Saeng is having a hard time adjusting to her new life, by waiting until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng gives herself time to adapt and heal. The paragraph shows Saengs courage and hope about retaking the test.	1	1	1
9288	4	The author concludes the story Winter Hibiscus  this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds. The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom.	3	3	3
9314	4	This paragraph @NUM1 includes to let the reader know it's winter. you know its winter because in the passage its says when the snow melt.	0	0	0
9325	4	The author concluded the story Winter Hibiscus  the way she did because she wanted to show saeng s determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, she was still too shaky to say the words at home .  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although shed had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,I failed the test , and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saengs determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in winter Hibiscus is used to show saengs determination.	3	3	3
9340	4	The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesnt stop budding so Saeng shouldnt stop trying!	2	1	2
9341	4	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says Its flowers arent pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months. This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saengs case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. 	3	3	3
9356	4	The author concludes the story the way he or she dose because it shows that the time she found the plant that she will get her lisens So it is a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms it starts over and so when she sets on gose to take a chance at the test she is starting new	1	1	1
9365	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story Saeng thinks about native plants shes seen before are now in @LOCATION1. She sees how theyre adapted to life there, like in the way the hibiscus can survive the winter. Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home. She doesnt necessarily need to adapt to survive, but to be successful. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its growth cycle) she will restart too and retake the test.	2	3	3
9371	4	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower.	1	2	2
9374	4	 The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesnt matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother	1	1	1
9401	4	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader.	2	3	3
9406	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because shes concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,. So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.	0	0	0
9409	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus the story ends with saying in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again The reason the author ends the story like that is because it showing that eves though she @MONTH1 of failed the test once shes not going to give up just because of as adjustment change. The Hibiscus made the reader relize that a plantation where she lives can adapt so can she. 	1	1	1
9423	4	The author of  Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho end the story with the statement, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again, because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese  mignitry and the Winter  Hibiscus Saeng, realized that many of the things that she had thought  of as strange before had become, through the guiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. Saeng realized that the test although strange and different to her now became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and Winter Hibiscus. This plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of one good times back at her home. The familiar  fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could  almost fast the light strures of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly mashed. The jolont made her think of good experiences. In the plant made her joyous enough not to think about past, but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States   	3	3	3
9429	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she overcame and she wants to re take the quiz for herself and to prove it to herself no one else. she states when they come back, saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. So she says that she wants to retake the test. So she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove to herself no one else.	1	2	2
9432	4	The author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country. The author concludes this way because it refers that its not over, and even though the test was a failure, it wont be next time. The author leads is know that the little girl cares about the test, and wants to prove to show people that she can pass it. She is reminded of her home by these flowers, and she has with this she can retake it and do it rite.	2	2	2
9434	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0	0
9440	4	I think the author of Winter Hibiscus said when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again. to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isnt giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way.	1	1	1
9450	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show saeng determination and her adaption to her new home. This shows her determination because it say I will take that test again."" This also shows that she has adapt to her new home."	1	1	1
9460	4	The author concludes the story with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistant Saeng is. Saeng is persistant because she trys over and over again at this test and also she trys to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistant. The way the author concludes the story, with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistant person, and that is the purpose of the quote.	2	2	2
9470	4	From the story of the girl just moved from Vietnam to United @ORGANIZATION1. It will be hard for the girl to understand anything and anything can bring her memory back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding. I-I failed the test, Saeng said it to her mother. Her mother actually understand why it happen and she will let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it will make Saeng feel better. Saeng miss Vietnam a lot and will like to try her best to overcome obstacles.	2	2	2
9502	4	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.	1	1	1
9515	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saengs outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are familiar to Saeng now  despite her thinking of them as strange before. The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saengs vow that she will take that test again in the spring, When the snows meltetc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saengs past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The authors wording was very well done.	3	3	3
9519	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It means shell try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres shes at and what she can @CAPS3 from it.	1	1	1
9557	4	In the last paragraph they trying to express what is coming. When winter is over spring will come which means the hibiscus will come back and it will be like home. Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her its like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and seamce thats back maybe she will do so much beter. Overall a new time is coming.  	1	1	1
9568	4	The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.	0	0	0
9574	4	"In the story Winter Hibiscus"", the auther finishes the story with this last paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again. The auther finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden. But she failed setting if there on time. That is why it says I will take that test again"". And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again. That is why the auther finished the story with that paragraph."	2	2	2
9583	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she is telling us what will happen beyond the story we are reading. It means when the snow melts, shell start all over again and rebuild the greenhouse.	0	0	0
9594	4	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time when the shows me. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, Saeng  brokedown and wept! The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the show will melt and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as yet another old friend. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage.	3	3	3
9619	4	The auther concludes the story with this statement because it shows that to her the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. It symbolizes this because she says...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again (Ho @NUM1). This shows that even though she failed it this time when the hibiscus gets bigger she will retake the test, it shows ??? or overcoming obstacles. Also I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it gives her strength from her old country. This shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test. It will do this by giving her strength or comforting her. From this you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement. ???...	2	2	2
9625	4	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,when the snows melt and the geese return this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement.   "	3	2	3
9627	4	I think the author includes this because she doesnt want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then I will take the test again. This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you dont no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.	2	2	2
9633	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the drivers test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.	1	1	1
9641	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.	2	1	2
9642	4	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning.  ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.	1	2	2
9646	4	The author ends with this response  because he is trying to say that Saeng will repeat her self but this time more helpful in the garden and her mother.Try harder with her school work and less focusing on gardening.	0	0	0
9647	4	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 have accomplished heR goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 want to puRsue heR career in gaRdenning. When she stated that when the plants come back aRound, she would take the test again. I think she means that, she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 have got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 have been a family tradition. Saeng will pRobably have kids and teach them about different types of floweRs.	1	1	1
9679	4	Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said yes| when she planted the hibiscus.	0	0	0
9685	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant wasent budding and the geese are going away and then see failed the test because all that made her sad. But when the snow melts, the geese return and the plant starts budding she will be happy again and she will take the test agian and she will pass because she is happy.	1	1	1
9694	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.	1	1	1
9718	4	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome.	1	1	1
9732	4	A vow is a good ending, she vowed to take the test again because she failed it. It expresses how she feels and she made a commitment to pass. The author wanted to show a lot of feeling and how desprite she was. So she saw tons of beauty to keep her going.	1	1	1
9734	4	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.	2	2	2
9737	4	Saeng  ment  that she will take that test  next  spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower  and  the  sight of her flock of geese  she  has high hopes that she will pass her test . when  she sees buds  on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the @CAPS1 time and she was hoping  she  passed  next  spring.	1	1	1
9744	4	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saengs situation is similar to the flowers, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home   	3	3	3
9773	4	The author ends the story likes this so readers can understant the theme. Which is, you can always start over, after a mistake is made. For example saeng failed herb driving test and then it took a toll on her she will try again in the spring. I guess she figures that once she once she has renewed  herself she'll do better.	1	1	1
9776	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. 	1	1	1
9785	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	1	1	1
9787	4	The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test. I thiNk the author was compariNg the hibiscus to their life aNd obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still staNdiNg theN that meaNs everythiNg will be fiNe to where she caN go back aNd take the test.	1	2	2
9804	4	In @CAPS1 Hibiscus, the author concludes the story with in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, to make a point. She needs all of those thing to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again.	1	1	1
9811	4	"The author concludes the story Winter Hibiscus with this sentence when they come back saeng vowed silently to her self in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. Its not a real one Im mean not the kind we had at-at she was still too shaky to say the words at home when the hibiscus buds she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to take the test"" or do things normally. The author concluded the story with the that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life."	3	2	3
9814	4	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland and loves nather and loves her mother. She loves the greeness and cant wait in tell spring comes. so she will take the test of being out of place to herself, that is why she concluds the story that way. 	1	1	1
9823	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that shell hopefully be stronger. By that I mean shell feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didnt get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  	1	1	1
9845	4	I am going to tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does is because it tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you she wont give up. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph. 	1	1	1
9851	4	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.	1	1	1
9853	4	"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she dont fail at doing so. For example, ""Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue."	1	0	1
9859	4	"The young girl Saeng from the story ""Winter Hibiscus by minfong Ho, has moved from her home land of Vietnam to the United States. The young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, The hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of Vietnam. When she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After planting the Hibiscus She watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng along with the Hibiscus and promises herself that"" in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes Hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."	2	2	2
9873	4	"The author of the story, chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her drivers test, but when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, And that rich, sweet scent  that was familiar too,"" talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she reconized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her drivers test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms."	2	3	3
9883	4	The author includes this paragraph into the story because the girl started giving up on herself and felt sad from moving to the United States and also from failing her drivers test, but lastly about the plant that she bought that wasnt real. Also because he wanted to show that her self esteem had gone up and that she was more confident and wasnt gonna give up on herself.	1	1	1
9886	4	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start. For example, when she says In the spring, whch the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. @CAPS1 she failed the first time and got the plant the next time shell pass it.	1	1	1
9887	4	The author include these paragraph in the story because the it spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talk about winter when it snows and keep snowing until spring hit and then the snow start to melt a way because the sun came out. One reason, is the author is talk about how it change weather when it changes.	0	0	0
9893	4	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story winter Hibiscus, the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying  I will take that test again, the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.	2	2	2
9920	4	The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drives test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, I-I failed the test. Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this.	2	1	2
9934	4	"The find lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her drivers test again, she will begin her new life."	2	2	2
9937	4	The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in its non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, Its strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matter (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saengs life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus.	3	3	3
9939	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesnt have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldnt be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2	2
9961	4	The final  paragraph in, winter  hibiscus by @CAPS1  Ho reads   When  they  come back, Saeng  vowed silently,  to  herself,  in  the  spring,  when  the  snow  melts  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is budding,then I will take that test  again.This paragraph compares  her to the flowers, which  shows that she is resilient like the flower is strong she is determined to take the test again next year and pass it. She would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home	2	2	2
9972	4	Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmothers scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in a blink. Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry.	1	1	1
9979	4	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.	2	2	2
9980	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time. Whats its saying is that she can try every year to get it right to impress her mother. In conclusion that what I have to say about the paragraph	1	1	1
9998	4	When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased	0	0	0
9999	4	In the passage winter Hibiscus by monfong Ho, the quote  when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states I  failed the test. This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The  when they came back quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again.	2	3	3
10021	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.	1	1	1
10034	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life.	2	1	2
10037	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl from vietnam moves to @LOCATION1 and fails the drivers test. After she decides to spend money on a winter hibiscus to remind her of her homeland, The ending paragraph, ""who troy come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. shows deep feeling towards nature. She feels as when the Geese we ready to return home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud so will she and she will take to drivers test again."	1	2	2
10050	4	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again. The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.	2	2	2
10057	4	Because she saying when the @CAPS1 grow back she will be @CAPS2 to take the test again.	3	3	3
10075	4	"Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything was unfamiliar to her, so she failed, but on her way back something familiar found her. Native plants of her home. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom, "" "" "" floating in the bucket. Saeng needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees the geese, and this symbolizes change. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched. Spring is a time for new beginnings, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. When the familiar object is at it's best, she will be her best and be able to face anything. Winter is the getting-ready stage."	2	2	2
10078	4	The author ofWinter Hibiscus uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of saengs future .Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of saeng for many reasons.  For one, both saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1.  Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her drivers test.  This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.   	2	2	2
10079	4	The author of ,Winter Hibiscus , concludes the story with the paragraph, When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again .The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader  understand  the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means.	1	1	1
10093	4	The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sence of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair. you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart whereever she goes. The text states that, it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her @CAPS1 Malik flower, as a sence of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test.  	2	2	2
10099	4	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.	2	1	2
10102	4	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it.	1	0	1
10111	4	The reason why the said she will wait til spring to take the test again, is to see if shes still like the bitter melon over the Big-mac.	0	0	0
10116	4	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants. She means in that last paragraph that she cant wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and that she can enjoy her plants.	0	0	0
10121	4	I believe the author concludes the story Winter Hibiscus, written by Minfong Ho, with When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story Winter Hibiscus with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up.	2	3	3
10136	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."	3	2	3
10138	4	The author concluded his storie with that paragraph is because thats how it should end and thats why he ended it like   that.     	0	0	0
10143	4	The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story.	1	1	1
10149	4	In the short story Winter Hibiscus a young girl named Saeng moves away from home. This short story is the girl is trying to adapt to the new lifestyle and changes.	1	1	1
10151	4	"In the stoRy WinteR Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authoR leaves the stoRy off with a poweRful ending. The ending was When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRself, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese RetuRn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will tRy the test again"". Basically the authoR concluded the stoRy with that because it shows she's poweRful, that she's willing to tRy and make heRself stRongeR, that she's willing to tRy again, and that she wants to help heRself. Text examples to pRoove this would be, then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost Reluctantly, she Realized that many of the things that she had thought of as stRange befoRe had become..."", and ""TheRe was a fRail, wiRy beauty to heR that touched Saeng deeply."" All those statements help backup why the authoR might leave such poweRful paRagRaph foR last."	1	2	2
10159	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isnt used to. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses.	1	2	2
10165	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didnt do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saengs determination to pass the test and do better next time.	1	1	1
10166	4	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is linting the plant that stands for many positive things to the character that failed the test that the really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perservirance and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isnt giving up on the test she wants to pass. The author is giving a message not to give up.	2	2	2
10171	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph of ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because this paragraph can show that the hibiscus is the reason why Saeng wants to try the test again. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melt and the geese return, then she can do as the hibiscus be strong and wont give up on her test."	1	1	1
10192	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1	1
10204	4	"Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the paragraph by saying when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl saids I-I failed the test. By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, The ""winter hibiscus was in the ground now, and @CAPS1 tamped down the soil around it. This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."	2	2	2
10211	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because its sympatizing Saeng ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another chance.this is symbolised by when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus"" After fail of the test. She wasn't own considering retaking the test, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not how to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adopt the cold harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm, like her she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it,because just like her the hibiscus survive the cold weather months, @CAPS1 bloom in the spring so must she last through the weather to pass in the spring. That is why the author consider the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, A sured that  to pass"	2	3	3
10212	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she is has perserverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly. And thAt she needs to appreciate it	1	1	1
10214	4	At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.	2	2	2
10215	4	The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that never giving up is important is presented and carried out hopefully through the characters vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard.	2	2	2
10224	4	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again. Moving can be a hardship especially when it is to place very unfimiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises & to remind them of their old home."	2	2	2
10227	4	I believe that the author concluded the story Winter @CAPS1 with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.	2	1	2
10268	4	The author used that paragraph in order to create imagry. The author wants you to get an image of the story. She also used that paragraph to express her emotions.	0	0	0
10274	4	"I @CAPS1 I @CAPS1 the author concludes the story with the paragraph saying that shes going to take the test again, to show us that this time shes goin to pass the test and shes not going to feel the same way she felt when she didnt pass. it tell us in spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" because thats when she is going to take the test. "	1	1	1
10294	4	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesnt know if she will pass but she isnt giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.  	1	1	1
10325	4	"In the Story the @CAPS1 concluds the story with the sentance ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". Also she is making a promise, or a vow to her self and to not give up on her goal."	2	1	2
10330	4	Saeng will take the test in the spring when its not so cold. She likes it when the hibicus is budding they smell so good. They good smell reminders her of her native contrey. Saeng likes fried melon, it leaves a golden after taste on your tongue. She would poter it over a Big mac. 	1	1	1
10336	4	Saeng has been the victim of a tragic  loss  in  family  and also  a move  to  a totally different  world. The paragraph  is  symbolic  of  turning over a new leaf and starting over.The snows  melting and hibiscus bidding are both symbolizing  new life.Saeng is going to have a outlook on life and accept  her situation to  make  the  best  of  it. Also, the  author say the  winter  hibiscus  was  in the ground now as  it does compare to saengs new found  outlook  planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope was planted into Saeng, and now she is ready to blossom.	2	2	2
10347	4	"The Author concudes this story with paragraph because She loves her garden. She concudes it because the story is about then and their garden and it eventually turns cold leaving them nothing to do untill Spring. Itsuggest they have strong feelings For what they do as it says ""in In spring when the snow nelts and the gese return and this hibiscus budding"" hears she wants to take the tst to overcome and prove She can take care of her Garden."	0	0	0
10352	4	The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is so sorry she did not @CAPS1 the test. Now saeng wants to make up for it, She vowed to herself she will @CAPS1 that test. For example, when I say to herself I am going to get sumthin done I do what it takes to get it done and I don't give up when things get rough, @CAPS3, This last sentense is what the main idea of the story is, To make up that test and @CAPS1 it, To get done what needs to be done	1	1	1
10355	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he is telling the reader that after the snow leaves the author will begin to plant more plants. The test is to make sure his plants dont die during next @DATE1.	0	0	0
10379	4	Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus with the lines when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again to show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes- familiar to Saeng now. Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test. That is why Minfong Ho ended Winter Hibiscus with the particular paragraph.	3	2	3
10387	4	"The author concluded the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive she can also. Saeng icoms that even though she has moved to the United States and it is different she is strong enough to survive. Failing her drivers test dosent mean that she is incapable of anything, but trying again with a fresh start like the hibiscus."	2	2	2
10392	4	The author concludes Winter Hibiscus with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different. The mother in the story says, Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. The hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme. This adds more understanding to the storys message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story.	2	3	3
10397	4	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing @CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year. 	2	3	3
10411	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself shell take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese. And when shes in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  	3	3	3
10425	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the drivers test. She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, shell start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2.	2	2	2
10426	4	The author concluded this story with the paragraph because, Saeng is explaing to the readers that she will take the test again when the time is right. When things seem to be getting better she will retake the test. That is why the authour used that paragraph to conclude her story.	1	1	1
10430	4	"In the story ""WiNter Hibiscus"" by MiNFOnG HO the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the sprinG, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddiNG, then I will take that test again"". The author concluded the story with that @CAPS1 because she is sayinG that when the year starts OFF @CAPS2 and starts over, that she will too. She's sayinG that when the Geese @CAPS3 back, the snow melts, and the Hibiscus starts to bud that they all start over and start a @CAPS2 beGiNNiNG. So when she Goes to take the test it will be a @CAPS2 year."	1	2	2
10432	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up.	1	1	1
10434	4	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says When they come back she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. In the spring shows when the flower will come back. When the snows melt and the geese return she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). And this Hibiscus is budding She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring.  Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"	1	2	2
10459	4	I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.	0	0	0
10470	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do.	1	1	1
10482	4	I am guessing the author adds this paragraph to tell the reader that when all of the beauty returns, she will try to get used to new thing again.	0	0	0
10483	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesnt bloom and Saeng fails her drivers test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.   	2	2	2
10487	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is going to adapt to the conditions of her new life. The hibiscus is a plant that thrives in warm, tropical climates. However it does not survive in the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which can survive in both climates (warm and cold) can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it hard to adapt. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can adjust to her new life in the United States. When she sees the geese come back for another spring and summers, she will take the driving test because they are giving her area another chance of being their home for the season. This is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	3	3	3
10493	4	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her.	2	2	2
10494	4	The author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers. She has grown to her environment like a flower. Also she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies and then comes back, she is going to come back and try the test again.	2	1	2
10503	4	The author concludes the story with the sentence saying when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when its not there things aint right but when it comes back things then out for the better. Also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. Last one not story this lets the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well	2	1	2
10507	4	The author ended the story that way to show that Saeng wont give up and is determined to complete her task. The author wants the reader to understand Saengs very sad and wants to overcome being homesick. Saeng is very much like the hibiscus plant, shes frail and beautiful. Saeng says she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost like shes growing along with the plant. 	2	1	2
10511	4	The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother was getting mad at her. Saengs mother was mad because she spent money on the whole plant instead of planting it and then it would be a lot cheaper. When her mother was mad and in disbelief, Saeng started crying and the mother forgave her for her actions. This shows that anything can happen	1	1	1
10514	4	I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.	0	0	0
10525	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and shed take the test again she saying that she is ready for whats ahead but will be open minded to whats new so that she can see were shes gone from. Therefore the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystry for what happend and to conclude.	2	2	2
10533	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good way to end the story off. At the end of this they was talkin about how saeng would come back when the snow melt and then she will take the test again.	0	0	0
10541	4	The author of this story concluding this story this way because instead opsorbing all the pain she can look in to the future. Aso by looking in to the future she can forget about the past and try better in the future.	1	1	1
10554	4	The author includes the exccept at the end for a meaning reason to Saeng. the hibiscus symbolizes everything, her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng feels that if the flower can bloom, so can she. Which will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test. It also resembles hope, because if the plant can make it through the winter and bloom in the spring, so can she. The author used this to connect the feelings of Saeng with the realistics of the flower bloomability.	2	1	2
10558	4	The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. When the geese come back  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesnt die each season. Its hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits.	2	2	2
10560	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didnt even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.	1	1	1
10566	4	In the quote above it is telling that saeng is glad to be back. Saeng also states that she would be ready to do it again if she had to.	1	1	1
10573	4	In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted.	1	2	2
10574	4	The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic meaning shes not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then Ill take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and Im not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.   	0	0	0
10575	4	The author includes this paragraph inorder to show an end to the story and to  show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continueation of Saengs life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and  hopefoly pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a colosing but a new beginging of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng.	1	2	2
10580	4	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her drivers's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character."	2	3	3
10591	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the Madagascar periwinkle growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  	1	1	1
10604	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. 	3	3	3
10616	4	Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.	2	2	2
10618	4	The author concludes her story with that last paragraph because it shows the relasonship between saeng and the habiscas, and how much just seeing it feels. It also shows that the habiscus  motivates her because it reminds her of her home land that she loves so much and that its like have a pysical memorie of her home land	1	1	1
10631	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test. To finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year. Since she tries to make a??? Shows she hasnt given up she will keep trying year after year. Also, it says that this girl is determined and she wont stop trying till she gets it right. Next, this last paragraph can tell you about the whole story. Lastly, I think it gives a feeling for the whole story.	2	2	2
10637	4	I think the author concludes this story like this because they was beautiful `@CAPS1 gave her good luck because the @NUM1 time around she didnt kno they was their	1	1	1
10641	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesnt want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return. Also I think it wants to inform the reader about what Saeng was thinking.	0	0	0
11894	5	"In the memoir from: Home The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood Narciso creates In his memoir is a sort of loving mood. This mood is described by The @CAPS1 ""I learned there how to love. I will never forget, and parents turned this simple house into a home"". this shows how he loved his home. Also The @CAPS1 ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and to that I am externaly grateful. This shows he loved That his parents passed on to him a love of cooking and cooking skills"	2	2	2
11896	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood was well shown in a few ways. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" The mood is is happy and greatfull for what Narciso learned. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the parenthesis it emphasizes the love Narciso has for Cuban music even more. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not."" This here shows how friendly both the families are together and they are happy to enjoy these meals."	2	3	3
11907	5	I think the mood in this story was sad/happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook  And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook.  Also In paragraph @NUM1 Its a paragraph dedicated to his parents. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good Jobs but when they came to the united states they had to startover.	2	2	2
11912	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of ""family"". She learned the definition of ""family"" at what she calls it her ""simple house"". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says ""It was here where I learned the definition of ""family.' "	2	1	2
11916	5	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood in the story is willing, greatful, and hopeful. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"" that quote represents that the family was willing to go through not having a good job like in cuba and segragtion to make a better life for their kids. ""My parents always kept there door open for the people we considered family"" this quote shows the family was was greatful to have a home and still let the people they loved live there with them. ""My mother and Father came to this country with such courage, with out knowlage of the language and culture. That quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life. In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the family was willing to do anything for a better life."	3	3	3
11922	5	No matter what nationality you are you can get along with anyone. He shows that his home, to him at least was a wonderful @CAPS1 with nice smells, food, and people. He is unexplainable happy and grateful for what his Parents did for him. To him it was @CAPS2/heaven on earth. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in the humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not Just scent and music but love and life. He will never forget that house or its gracious neigh bor hood.	2	1	2
11934	5	Narciso was very proud of his cuban culture. He was very happy with who he had become, and how he had been raised. Narciso set a very proud and greatful tone to this memoir. He explains that family isnt about blood relations; its about people who love eachother, and are going to be there for eachother. He told us that his parents passed on the cuban culture to him, in cooking. He also explained how his parents built the home on their own, that he got to grow up in. Narciso says how proud he is to be a cuban, and how his family works @CAPS1 hard to earn a living. Narciso told us how proud and happy he was, to be in a nice home, with friends, family, and a future. He told us he learned to love.	3	3	3
11945	5	"The author created a sense of love and care in Narciso Rodriguez. The author talked about the sense of family and how people don't have to all be the same to become one community. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it explains ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immagrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 shared the feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one ""family"" in a rascist enviroment. @CAPS1 shared how his parents made the difficult decision to move to the new place leaving loved ones behind for their children's better future (@CAPS2 @NUM2). @CAPS1 showed a lot of admiration for his parents based on what they do for him and how they always have other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals.

The author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir."	3	4	4
11946	5	The mood that was created by the author is loving. It teaches the reader that the heart felted sacrifice and hardship the parents endured is priceless and the love that an immigrant family has for one another is endless. This mood explains the true definition of family and the unconditional, unfadeable love that a family has for one another and for its neighbor. This is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it tells the reader how grateful the author is for having such persistent, loving parents whose faith and determination for a better future taught the author how to love and appreciate the courage and strength one must have to overcome the struggles and barriers on this pursuit of happiness everyone is destined to follow. The mood of this memoir explains how precious is a home and the memories contained in it. This is the mood the author created in his memoir.	2	3	3
11974	5	In this memoir, the author touches upon serious facts while giving the memoir a fun and happy mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 they talked about how others who aren't even related to them come to do different activities with them, while still touching upon a serious topic about how his real grandparents weren't allowed to leave Cuba until 1970. The author also shows how even though they struggled and went through hardships in their home in the @LOCATION2, they were still able to keep their Cuban culture going along with the music they played and food. He portrays a mood that shows you can be happy no matter what the hardships you endure.	2	2	2

Knowing that theywould do the same for us."" This memoir's moodis mostly about love and who you will be proud about. They're setting atone that says you shouldn't be discouraged about who you are and where you come from, but to beproud about whoyouare asa person."	4	4	4
11984	5	The mood Narciso Rodriguez is trying to portray in this memoir is very relaxing and greatful. He wants to be able to show his readers that he is greatful for how his parents raised him and what type of enviornment it was. By reading this memoir one almost feels like they are at his house, surrounded by his friends and family. Narciso Rodriguez is also trying to show happyness, how he was happy with his life and always having friends around him.	2	1	2
11985	5	"The mood created by the author of the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives is love. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote shows that even though they technically weren't family, they still loved eachother enough to be family. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 and it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that they love eachother more than anything. they are leaving behind and would do anything to give them better lives. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that for his parents loving him, he gives them love. That is the mood in the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives."	3	4	4
11999	5	"The mood created by the authar was warmthness. He was so @CAPS1 toward his family moving @CAPS2, he also cared for his parents alot and what they had done for their family. I know this because ""I will never forget how my parents turn to the simple house into a home""."	3	2	3
12000	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives mood created is described. The starting evidence found in the memior is. ""my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" The mood being created is detirmenation. The parents were determined to make it to the United States because that was hard to do. But the parents did make it to the United States. The other piece of evidence found is ""in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two-family, blonde-brick building in the @CAPS1 bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" The mood being created is happiness and sadness. There is happiness because he was just born. The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they live in a two-family house. This is the moods created in the memior."	2	2	2
12010	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the excerpt from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives, is very thankFul. ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" ""I will always be grateful to my parents"" @CAPS1 like these that are scattered thro-ugh out the excerpt show greatfulness, and love for his parents. Some other @CAPS1 like ""They came selflessly"" and ""... To give their children a better life"". Throughout the excerpt he tries to express how greatful he is to his parents, and community. One quote that can to mind when reading paragraphs @NUM1 & @NUM2 is ""It takes a village to raise a child"" I think thats how @ORGANIZATION1's community worked. They weren't just neighbors, they were family."	2	2	2
12025	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, there was only one @LOCATION1 mood I think. The mood I think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness. There are a lot of examples that make me think that. One example that I think is best is the last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" I think this is the best example of happiness because even though they didn't live in the biggest house, the were still happy with what they had. That is what I think the mood created by the author was."	2	2	2
12026	5	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a profound sense of closeness and selflessness that so enriched Narciso's childhood. The mood created by Narciso comes from his memoir, in which he lived a poor life, but a life that was enriched by friends and family that had a very close bond, one that overcame racism and tough time. ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""      The mood created by Narciso displays how his community acted, and shows how close is friends and family were. It is a mood that helps readers understand Narciso's community.       The mood created by Narciso is also one of selflessness, as Narciso describes his community as one of ""honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need.""       @CAPS1, Narciso creates a mood of closeness and selflessness."	2	2	2
12027	5	@PERSON1 is a short story about a boy who is very grateful & shows a lot of appriciation torwards his parents. He feels that he is at home even though he moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 it said his parents created his new home to look like a cuban home he had back in cuba by putting cuban thing on the wall. I feel that in this short story he is very grateful because he said in paragraph @NUM2 he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house to a home. @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story.	2	2	2
12029	5	Narciso Rodriguez loves his family and home very much. In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. He really wants people to be able to feel to happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him. He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent.	2	2	2
12031	5	"Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for what his parents gave him, thus that is the overlying mood in the memoir, being thankful. Rodriguez was thankful that his parents came over from Cuba to give him a better life. Even though he says that his parents had to leave behind ""family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Rodriguez is also thankful that his parents taught him selfless ness + generosity. For example, he says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarely until they were able to get ba- ck on their feet."" It is very genorous to help some body in that way. Over all Rodriguez is thankful for his Cuban culture. Cuban culture encompasses cooking & music, but most impo- rtant ly family, having nothing to do with being a blood relative, but the fact that you have respect + love for everyone. The mood of this memoir is being thankful and is presented in all these different ways."	4	3	4
12047	5	"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" ""instilled,"" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionite and full of gratitude."	2	4	2
12050	5	I described the mood create by the author in the memoir and they work really hard to create the mood.	0	0	0
12054	5	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference."	2	3	3
12055	5	"In the memoir the mood that the author created is the memoir can be @CAPS1 in two ways. first was happy for being created and being able to use america's beautifulfriendlyness. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to a blood relative."" @CAPS2 was that knowing that if you have hope anything can be achived. ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	2	2
12068	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man."	3	3	3
12091	5	"In the memoir the author creates a happy mood. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he enjoyed and is thankful for from his childhood. He does this by talking about how his kitchen table was surronded by his ""family"". Or as he say ""countloss extended family members cane and went."" This shows that there were always people around. He also says how he is thankful for how his parents came to the @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life"". Finally he says he is greatful to his parents ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrife."" @CAPS1 in the memeor the author creates a happy modd by talking about his childhood surronded by family and thankes his parents for there sacrifeces they made to give him a betters life."	3	3	3
12097	5	I think the mood is a very happy great full mood. the speaker seams very happy of her live and how it was growing up. Narciso seems very greatful of her parent and every body  around her and her whole life growing up. Also about how her neighbor hood was. How every body was happy and were all firends and how there were a lot of imagrants in her neighborhood.	1	1	1
12099	5	"In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The authors said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were."	3	3	3
12102	5	"The mood that the author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had. The author values relationships and he is grateful to have his "" family"". He says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1""  In other words he is saying that he is lucky to have what he has, a ""family"". Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people, showing that they knew that others had less, and that they were grateful for what they had. Mood, means tone or a feeling, so the mood of this was grateful and happy."	4	3	4
12114	5	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a sad story. The mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time. One example is when his parents left from Cuba for his son's own sake for a better place. His parents had great jobs in Cuba. His mother was a Chemical @ORGANIZATION1. and his father worked in a labratory. ""In Cuba @PERSON2,had worked in a laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering."" The author's mood of this story is sad."	2	1	2
12160	5	"In this memoir about @PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the @CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless.     In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do.      In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."""	2	3	3
12161	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir was admiration. First of all @CAPS2 felt proud of his parents because they share ""Cooking duties and the work around the house."" @CAPS1 of all @CAPS2 felt @CAPS3 of knowing cuban background and @CAPS2 was proud because his parents were cuban. @CAPS2 was very admire by his parents because @CAPS2 was proud of being cuban two. These is the mood created by the author in the momoir."	1	2	2
12186	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is. First, the moon that I think is a warm and and saying there's no place like home feeling. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship as in home and and the people around us is like family and we come and unit as friends and families. Also Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. To finish my describtion of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez theres no place like to feel at home."	2	2	2
12211	5	"The mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez's love. Love is the mood for many reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were very caring. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the lanunguage or the culture."" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM2). @PERSON2's parents did everything out of pure love. Because of them @PERSON2 lived a life filled with happiness and love."	3	3	3
12220	5	The mood in the memoir is basicly showing love, happiness, and friendship. The way that the mood shows love is in @CAPS1 @NUM1 and @NUM2. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 is says Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it talks about how his parent welcome refugees to celebrate their arrival to @LOCATION1. Happiness was shown throughout the story. And friendship was shown as well The way that friendship was shown by his parents keeping their door open to whom who did not have a home. But let them stay in their home until their back on he or she is back on there feet, and considerd part of the family.	2	2	2
12226	5	"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving but most prominantally gratitude.Time and time again the author shows his gratitude toward his parents for making life for him growing up special in a loving atmosphere. He describes how grateful he is for his parents cooking in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" In the same paragraph he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]"". His parents taught him to be open and loving to others as said in paragraph @NUM2 ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring. I feel he best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and in paragraph @NUM4 and he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" "	4	4	4
12230	5	In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way.	2	3	3
12233	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."	3	2	3
12236	5	"The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times."" This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."""	2	3	3
12273	5	"The mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author. One of the moods that was created in the memoir was happiness. Back in his past, his parents shared all of their Cuban family recipes, they had a lot of family and friend celebrations with the rest of the neighbor hood, sharing friendship and helping others in need @CAPS1 as long as you can sea, the family and the neighbors all came together as one big family to be happy, to make a happy community, and that made the memoir happy. Another mood that was created by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything. He talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to get further away, and the mood changes to sadness. The memories are growing old, but he will always remember his ""family""and his name. The author did a great job at creating those two moods and putting them into his memoir."	3	4	4
12288	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was in a very thankful mood. The author shows how proud @CAPS1 was of his parents and how thankful @CAPS1 is. @CAPS1 also like His new enviroment, and his surprised how all the cultures fit together with No problem. @CAPS1 also explains how grateful @CAPS1 was to His parents for their love and sacrifice. In conclusion @CAPS1 was very proud and thankful to his parents.	2	1	2
12291	5	"There are Three Things That discribe The @CAPS1 in This memior. one of Them is The authors love for his Cuban heritage. ""@CAPS2 cuban music [which I love to this day] filled the air, Mixing The aroma of the kitchen. Another way The author discribes The @CAPS1 is The houses his parents owned. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in The @CAPS4 bound @CAPS5 of Newark, New Jersey"". The last thing That discribes The @CAPS1 is The love and sacrifice That They gave there son.

12313	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is a nonstalgic mood is created from his memories. The mood is created by his parents and where he lives. One way the mood is nonstalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents, he is helping the nonstalgic mood grow. Also, where he live helps the mood. ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home those"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Since his parents turned his house, to a home he will never forget what they did for him, making this memoir more nonstalgic.

12332	5	"A) The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic mood. It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say ""my parents will always be there for me."""	2	1	1
12338	5	The life @PERSON1 lived as a child was a paradise in his eyes. He learned what a family really was, people who cares for eachother no matter what. And in his eyes, his whole community was one big family. His parents were kind, giving and generous to everyone. Despite the different customs elsewhere, all of these cultures were united as one family. They would lend a hand for anyone who needed it, because they know that they'd do the same for them. Throughout his life, he'd never forget his wonderful childhood and all the things he was taught, @CAPS1 and Generosity.	2	2	2
12340	5	"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author, Narciso Rodriguez created a mood throughout the memoir of his home and Family. Narciso talks about how lucky he was to have had such a wonderful home where he belonged and a family that was always there for him. Narciso put it best in the last few lines of his memoir that say ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""A big mood in the memoir was a feeling of warmth and happiness, an enviroment where everyone was family, a strong sense of community, togetherness and belonging, that love, care, family and friendship is always there, and that this was home, always and forever. ""In our neighborhood,... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need... My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us.""@CAPS1 mood in the memoir was a feeling of strong love and gratefulness Narciso felt for his parents. They were strong, courageous, selfless and brave, and they gave up so much to give Narciso a better life."" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.""

12347	5	The overall mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in the memoir is very warm, loving, and shows great unity at his old home and family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso talks about the great selflessness and courage that his parents had when they immigrated to @LOCATION2. Narciso talks about how grateful he is to them, for leaving their homeland so that he could have a better life. During the @NUM2 and @NUM3 paragraphs of the memoir, Narciso describes the warms and generosity of his family. He also showed how family doesn't necessarily mean a blood relative. His family came from Cuba, but there were also other cultures in their neighborhood such as @CAPS1, and also Spanish immigrants as well This loving and extremely rich cultural background that he had lived in as a child showed great unity between different types of people. Narciso's family's door was always open to anyone in need. Narciso Rodriguez's definition of family, shows that his background was full of sharing, joy, and love all squeezed into his small apartment in New Jersey.	3	4	4
12353	5	"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez protrayed very strongly in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is gratitude. In the memo I @CAPS1 mentions how thankful @CAPS1 truly is to his parents for giving him a life of family, and happiness, love etc. For example @CAPS1 thanks them for their ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful)."" Narciso is grateful in a way @CAPS1 could never be able to show them his gratitude. ""... I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" Narciso ""will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is greatful for what they did for a better life, for showing him happiness, family, love and sacrifice. Overall the main mood of this memoir is gratitude."	3	3	3
12365	5	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood in the story, the author does this by writing in a certain way. One way the author does this is by writing very empathetacly. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM1). A second way the author sets the mood is by sneaking in deeper thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses. For example in paragraph @NUM2. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" A third way the author sets the mood is by speaking so fondly of their parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". (paragraph @NUM3). The overall mood that the author sets for this memoir is a kind, sweet and thankful mood, Narciso Rodriguez, is thankful for many thing; family, culture and living in america."	4	3	4

It also says that they learned the real definition of family. this is why it is set too a sadly love mood. They were an immigrants. This memoir is inspirational."	2	1	2
12531	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a mood for @PERSON1. The mood the author created was something different, but it never seems to go down.As Narciso Rodriguez really gives you the definition of ""family"", in the memoir. One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that they talked about moving into a new home, and to the heart was the kitchen, they cooked while listening to cubic music. Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Narciso's mood is suddenly more strict, but proud of her parents. The last example would be, in all of the last paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and pround to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her.

12539	5	Narciso Rodriguez created a very positive mood throughout the memoir. The mood that was created by the other was happy. I chose this mood because in the memoir he describes how nice it was to live in a town where people cared for him.

In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the author created a very positive mood throughout the memoir.	2	1	2

12560	5	@PERSON1 is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood. Throughout the reading Narciso created a very grateful and excited mood.

That is the mood that @PERSON1 showed in his memoir of his family.	2	2	2
12567	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes. For example paragraph @NUM1 rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day). Every time there is parentheses means that the mood of the story changes when he talks about his life in cuba and the new life here in america. He is grateful that he is in america and that his parents left cuba where they had a better life.	2	2	2
12568	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez has a loving and caring feel to it. Since he is talking about his family of course he is going to @CAPS1 loving.

So the mood created in the excerpt is loving and caring."	1	2	2

Narciso pats many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (paragraf @NUM1) This gives a sence that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family."" (paragraf @NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very careing place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'.""

12671	5	"The mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents. First, he author talks about how her parents give up what ever they had for them. It says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially..."" This means that their parents gave up their family and friends and jobs in their beloved country, Cuba, just for him and his sister so he appreciate them a lot for doing all of these for them. Secondly his parents showed him the two lessons abot life. The story states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I've often told them the admiration for their strength and perseverance... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. This shows that his parents taught his something important without telling him by showing him.

12695	5	This memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling. When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood-related to you I think of my friends and the people I can count on. They are my family too. He also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home, not without memories, your family, and something or someone that you trust. Lastly, he tells us about how greatful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love. This piece makes me think about and appreciate my family, and my home.	3	3	3
12722	5	In this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is. At the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life. And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music. Also, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them.	2	2	2
12734	5	"The mood created by the author is that he is realy happy that his parents moved to america to live close to friends and family because in paragraph @NUM1 it says"" countless extended family members came and went -- and there was alway someone temporarily staying with us."""	1	1	1
12735	5	"I feel that the mood (s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is saying that his parents were kind and they worked hard and that made him happy I think.Another mood I think is he was proud. He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""I will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice. He is gratful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM3). That's what I feel the mood (s) are in the memoir are."	4	2	3
12738	5	"There is a mood created by the author in the memoir.One way in which the mood is created is by explaining how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up.Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood.A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The narrator explained how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another.As you can see, the author of the memoir created a late mood in the memoir."	3	3	3
12761	5	"The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 is happy, loving, and upbeat or lively. Happiness is seen by the reader when he Is ex plaing the way many different cultures ""come together in great solidarity and friendship"" @PERSON1 is happy he grew up here and is happy with everything about his childhood in this neighborhood. The author loves everything about this neighborhood. @PERSON1 especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them. @PERSON1's writing is very lively and he writes with great passion. The fact that the author puts so much happiness, love and life into his memoir is what makes it so interesting to read and what makes the mood so fantastic."	3	2	3
12770	5	"In the memoir the author creates many moods with in it. In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family and wouldn't care. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he says"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This is him showing that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the moods the memoir created."	3	3	3
12778	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness, safety, and care. Narciso had parents who loved him and a very close-knit community. All the descriptions of his family cooking and family neighbors eating together is enough to make anyone feel happy. Throughout the memoir, Narciso emphasizes the care of his parents. You know Narciso's parents loved him as of his attitude toward them. In paragraph @NUM1, when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" shows his parents' care for him. When the author writes, ""In our neighborhood,... all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" These two sentences give the reader feelings of safety and once again emphasize care. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of happiness, safety, and care."	3	4	4
12784	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir is very significant. He expresses love, appriciation, and unity. Narciso shows a lot of love not only to his parents, but to his culture. He stated often about how thankful he was to grow up around cuban food and music. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" and, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 he showed appritation toard his parents. Narciso often states how much he admires them for their bravery by coming to @LOCATION1. He talks alot about how they turned their simple house into a home in paragraph @NUM2. Finally, unity was shown a great deal in his community because they were mostly all cuban, spanish, or Italian imagrents, and they tended to stick together. Overall, Narciso really learned what the word ""family"" means."	3	4	4
12809	5	The moode the author has in this memoir is happines. He states that growing up around in the envirnorment gave him a sence of family, he says that here in my house felt lik cuba. He and his whole family have respected each other and others. Thats the authors mood	2	1	2
12816	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) All got along very well in solidarity with one another which creates a sense of love. Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music. Lastly when he and his family take in family or even just really close friends who they consider family conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love.	2	2	2
12838	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too."	2	3	3
12894	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" he demenstrates a mood of love. @ORGANIZATION1 shows his love by telling his parents. In the @NUM1 paragraph he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Here he shows his compassion for his parents because his parents left cuba and went to @LOCATION1 to start a new life. Also, they wanted a better education for their children so they left family, friends, everything behind so they could restart their life. Another way how Narciso shows love to his parent is by using what his parents did to him into his life. Narciso used the better education, to have a better life. Now he is a fashion designer. Therefore, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", he shows a mood of love in the memoir."	2	2	2
12902	5	He was happy to be educated like he is and he was happy to be Cuban and even though his parents didn't have much he was still proud of his family because is not where you live or in what conditions is. If you are from an honest family and if they're with you in the hard moments.	1	1	1
12905	5	In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the author in the memoir. The mood was like excited because Narciso Rodriguez is man that we can tell that he is a man that apreciate what his family did for him. Because in the memoir say that he felt graceful and happy about his culture. He is from cuba, his family are so friendship. His family teach him lots of stuff that why now is have been the basis of his life. His friend have inportant friends. Now in this memoir he express all and also how proud he felt about his family. And his admiration about his family is awsome. he learned with his family how to love others and how to respect.

12919	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits. One trait of the mood is selflessnes and courage. It is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they love."" Would you be able to throw away your life, into an alien world, just so that your children would have a better future? Doing this would take lots of selflessnes and courage. Also, the mood has gratefulness. The author shows this in paragraph @NUM2 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author's gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and courage for coming over to @LOCATION2 to give him a better future. Finally, unity is found in the mood. It is found in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs else where, all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and freindship. It was a close- knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows great unity in their neighborhood because in other parts of the United States, these three races didn't get alond, but in this neighborhood they were unified. In conclusion, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits."	3	4	4
12929	5	"The author creates a very warm happy welcoming feeling by describing how friends and family are always visiting and how happy the family is all the time.

This quote from the memoir proves that Narciso is creating a good mood throughout the story.""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote i think shows very well that the author is creating a happy mood in his memoir."	2	2	2

They based their lives on family and happiness inside their home. He said that ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open."" this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them. It also stated people in your family don't have to be blood related and that many people where welcome to eat dinner with them. This shows how nice and how well the neighborhood got along. They would also surround themselves with Cuban food and music show that they where proud of who they were and that they made their new home a nice and piecefull environment."	2	3	3
12967	5	In the memoir this is how the author created the mood, he tells of how his parents lived in a house where it was very poor at that time. His parents immigrated to @LOCATION1 where Narciso was born. he was raised in the ghetto. When he was living here it was during the time of racism and segregation. Narciso didnt know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. This was how the author created the mood.	0	1	1
12970	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives it talks about this fashion designers life. One example is in paragraph @NUM1 page @NUM2 it talks about his backround Narciso states ""My parent, originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956..."" The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names. Nex it is paragraph @NUM3 page @NUM2. This sets the mood of him growing up in a new inviorment. For example he States ""Growing up in this new instilled in me a great ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our nieborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a tim when overt racism was the norm of segregation prevailed in the United States."" @CAPS1 is on page @NUM5 paragraph @NUM6. It shows the mood of how he loves his house. For example he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many thing or I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion this is how the mood creates the author."	2	4	3
12974	5	"on paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say's ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.""

12981	5	"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefullness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home. The memoir states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). You can almost feel how grateful he is for is happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the writing. Finally, there is a warmth that contributes heavily to the mood of the memoir. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Narciso has become a better person because of the warmth and involvement in his home and, like the warmth formed the backdrop of his life it also forms the backdrop for the mood of the memoir."	4	4	4
12987	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood that is created by the author is love and sacrifice. In the memoir, the author shows love by not only showing the love between the child and the parents but by also showing the love throughout the community. The author shows sacrifice by showing what the parents had to give up in order for their child to have a better life. In the memoir, it talks a lot about the neighborhood, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people."" This shows the closeness of the people in the neighborhood had and this represents the love as well.

Love and sacrifice is the mood throughout the memoir that the author created."	4	4	4
12992	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is respectful. First of all, Narciso's parents were very courages. When Narciso talks about his parents, he says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). Narciso gives his parents the respect they deserve by describing their actions as ""such courage."" @CAPS1 of all, Narciso's parents wanted their kids to have a better life. When Narciso explains why his parents came to the United States, he says, ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behing their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). When it says ""They came...to give their children a better life"" shows that Narciso's parents love their kids so much, they did what they could to give their kids a better future, which deserves great respect. Finally, Narciso is greatful for what his parents did.

13016	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful mood for the reader. First, right of the bat I felt love and thoughtfulness, which I still felt throughout the story. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This made me think of my parents immediately. My father gave up his career and my mother gave up her family to give me and my brothers a better life. This feeling is without words. I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does. Secondly, the admiration I shared with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly."" What her parents did for her was incredible and something to learn from. From Narciso's story, I got a sense of admiration, greatfulness, and connection, which I believe are the moods she created throughout his story."	2	3	3
13029	5	The mood the @CAPS1 created was a mood of happiness and gratitude. The @CAPS1 States how he will always be grateful for what his parents did for him. He also stated that he admired them and honestly could never repay them for everything they did This shows how the @CAPS1 @CAPS4 how his parents worked so hard to make his life better. He is forever greatful.	2	1	2
13035	5	"The mood created by the author of the memior exposed various emotions and contrast. In paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author talks alot about culture, he explains how they could not live without having their practice, in their lives. ""Rich culinary Skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionat Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ...""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity"". Another mood the author captures is greatfullness. In paragraph six the author explains how he is so grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed from moving away from Cuba. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done."" The final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family. He looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today. These are some moods the author creates throughout the memoir."	3	3	3
13068	5	"Throughout this @CAPS1 there is a very happy and loving vibe. This is shown in paragraph @NUM1, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in a warm home. This paints a glorious picture of what @CAPS2 life in the house was like. Another example in the text is at the end, in paragraph @NUM2, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" This shows with happiness and love, It does not matter how rich you are, or what you own. Anything can be a home."	2	2	2
13087	5	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood of the reading could be described as grateful. I can sense this mood by some of the things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. The author would constantly say ""thank you"" to his parents for all the sacarfies they had to mak for a suitable living enviroment for Narciso. It also states that ""there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Over all, in the memoir of @PERSON1 the mood can be mainly described as Grateful towards his parents, heritage and home."	2	2	2
13101	5	They were sad through some of this memoir. The first reason why they were sad was that they left there familys. They also had to leave the country of Cuba. And left their friends to. They were also happy too. The reason why is because it is a Spanish, Cuban, and @CAPS1 comunity. So they feel like they are at home.    They were made because they would half to start there life over. They would have to find new jobs and transportation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	1	1	1
13106	5	"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it ""our traditional Cuban home"" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born. Even after that they were still kind and had open arm for other immagrants. So I absolutly think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love."	3	2	3
13117	5	The mood that was created by the @CAPS1 is that no matter if your an immigrate or not one you could make friends and have family that you love still with you and could make some friends. Another mood that he talks about is tha his parents and how they love to cook together and are selflessness too.	1	1	1
13124	5	"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family. Throughout the whole excerpt, Rodriguez lists many times he was happy and grateful for everything his parents have done for him, which sets a positive mood."	3	3	3
13126	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, shows an specific mood. The mood from this is happieness and satisfaction. The family is happy because they got a new home, they have a child, and they made pretty good friends from the nabiorhood. The satisfaction part is in there too when they are satisfiyed with what they got like, a job, a home, family, friends, and they are makeing money. After all moods depend on your surroundings, like the people not the merchendise. And thats all that matters."	2	2	2
13133	5	"The mood created by the author in this... memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation. I think @PERSON1, wrote this memoir for his parents. He wanted to portrey that even though most people would think that he had a tough life, he would completely disagree. He reailzes that his parents did what they did so @PERSON1 would have a better life. He appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family. They were loving, caring, heartwarming people. Like @PERSON1 said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	2	2

13147	5	"Memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author explains his family in a very @CAPS1 way. The author talks about his love of cooking, how his parents want to give their children a better life by moving to @LOCATION1 leaving loved ones behind, and the author @CAPS1 his house.The kitchen was the very heart of the home to the author. His parents was very skilled in cooking, which passed onto their children. The author says on paragraph @NUM1, "" A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author's love for culinary skills. Next, is how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about @LOCATION1, but moved there just to give a better life for their children. The parents had to leave their loved families, friends, and country. For example, on paragraph @NUM2, it explains what the parents had to. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows the parents realy loved their children wanted them to be happy.

He is happy he has this family and he is happy that he has the simple house he was born in. There are a few choices the mood could be The one that the author has written about is happiness. He grew up where he had friends or family to have someone that they trust. He also had his land lord and first friend that helped grace their kitchen table for meals. His parents opened the door for family members, knowing that others would do the same. He thinks his parents are brave that they would have  courage to come to @LOCATION1, knowing that they would leave everything behind. He is most happy about how he learned about the real meaning of ""family""."	2	3	3
13183	5	"In this memoir Narciso talks about his life. As @CAPS1 talk @CAPS1 always creates a @NUM1 creates a mood by talking about his environment. In paragraph @NUM2 it say, ""that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" @CAPS1 created a good mood cause @CAPS1 knows @CAPS1 has a lot of friends.Secondly, Narciso creates a mood talking about his first friend. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, Alegria lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not. Good mood for having a friend thats so @NUM4 creates a mood talking about his parents. In paragraph @NUM5 it says, ""My mother and fathe had come here with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. @CAPS1's in a good mood because his parents had alot of courage.Clearly Narciso creates a mood in the memoir."	3	3	3
13185	5	"Home is where the heart is. In this case, his ""Family"" is his heart, and his house is his home. He's cubain but never been to cuba to see his real family."	1	1	1
13188	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and how he wrote his feelings of being cuban. For example she was saying that she will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. The author feel really happy of being cuban and celebrating her cultures in the United @ORGANIZATION1.	2	1	2
13190	5	"It was a very high up, cheerful mood. It made me feel as if I was there. In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". That means he thanks his parents for all the hard work they did. The @CAPS1 they made. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it said ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture"". He is proud of his parents on coming from their country and speaking a different language and learning a new one is hard. All in all it was a very high up, cheerfull mood."	2	2	2
13198	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was very happy and thankful. He grew up in a traditional Cuban home where his parents cooked and he was able to get a great sense of ""family"". Not just blood relatives but everyone who would do the same as them. There was no racism within their neighborhood. They all came togather Many people, and the for dinner everynight. His parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him. His simple house was a home. These things created the happy and thankful mood"	2	2	2
13200	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of love, kindness, and welcome. This is true because the author uses adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to describe how the family lives surrounded by kind people with a loving ambience. Also, the author describes how his family always welcomed others into their home and received a similar kindness back. This, @CAPS1 describes, is because they consider everyone as family, which, as Narciso believes, is because of their love for each other. finally, the author explains how @CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 states that @CAPS1 ""thanked them repeatedly."" This also shows how Narciso wrote his memoirs to be full of love, especially for his parents, which dictated the mood of the piece."	3	3	3
13202	5	The mood is warm, happy nice. His parents were open with warm hearts, kindness to anybody in trouble. The would have people over and stay with them as long as they like.	1	1	1
13212	5	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he undoubtedly creates a mood of happyness and love, love for his family and friends. His definition of family is different from other people's definitions, but many people would agree with his definition. He calls family not only blood relatives, but the love and friendship that people have for eachother. By creating a mood of love and happyness draws the reader into a cultural story and how his life was affected by that of his parents, and his family. When he describes the food, the laughter, the neighbors, the kitchen, and the house, it all feels very warm and feels like a place someone would love to be at. Because he talks about things people want to hear, he accomplishes a great feeling of warmth and being happy throughout the reading.	3	3	3
13219	5	In the memoir the author created the mood of being happy and joyfull. One reason I feel this way is by the way he talks about what goes on in his home. Like when he talks about the hart of the home being the kitchen and how his parents passed on the skills and a love for cooking to him in paragraph @NUM1. Another reason I feel this way is the way he describes the types of friendships he has with is neighborhood. Like in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about how all of the different cultures come together and have great friendships with each other. As I read this it makes me think of all the fun and joyfull things that happened at my house and wonder what else will happen at my house in the future.	2	3	3
13222	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir felt happy, and very greatful. In the memoir it tells how the author, Narciso Rodriguez feels ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". which gives that he is so, so, so grateful and happy of his life, which makes the reason happy to hear that his parents sacrificed themselves for their children to have a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved."	1	2	2
13224	5	His mood of this author is @CAPS1 and detailed. He describes the life of this person and tells life about the family. He says and describes how he lives in a two family, blond brick house in @LOCATION1, and passionate about cuban music. There was Cuban and Italian immagrants who were racist and didn't care.	1	2	2
13232	5	"In this memoir, the author creates a very unified and comforting, but also responsible and thoughtful, tone. Within the second paragraph, Narciso Rodriguez provided a sentence to generally describe his thoughts toward his three room apartment, claiming it to be where ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The adjectives that Rodriguez providvedes in the sentence, such as ""innocence"" and ""warm"" provide for a comforting feel, while ""congregation"" adds to the concept of the unity. However, he is also shows that his parents were very responsible and hardworking, coming to the United States ""selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers"". With all this self sacrifice, Narciso Rodriguez himself expresses gratitude in great amounts towards his parents, constantly thanking them for the opportunities they provided for him."	4	4	4
13235	5	The mood of the memoir is very appreciative. The author is appreciative for his culture and Cuban descent. He shows that his culinary Skills improved because of the phase change from a house to a home. His parents are greatful to have a great designer learn and egknowloge @CAPS1 of the Cuban Skills he had learned just from the mood of his life as a child.	1	1	1
13261	5	In, @CAPS1 of our lives @CAPS2 narciso Rodriguez. The mood was calm and @CAPS3, and this I why he metiond how @CAPS4 he Is To every one and I like how he @CAPS5 a Back round story. Like in @CAPS6 one he @CAPS5 a story time line for what was To happend. That Is The mood/@CAPS8	1	1	1
13269	5	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was loving, caring, warm, and inviting. The loving atmosphere was created by how much the family really did love each other. The family also loved their Cuban culture. The mood was also caring and friendly. The familes from all different countries cared for one another. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner. The Rodriguez family really brought their culture to their new home and Narciso mentioned in the last paragraph that this is where he found out the definition for family while living in this neighborhood. The mood was created very clearly by the author in this memoir."	3	2	3
13280	5	"The mood of the memoir is gracious. Rodriguez is grateful for many things listed in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS2 says @CAPS2 is grateful for his inheritance of the cuban culinary gift. In @CAPS1 @NUM2, by saying ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" @CAPS2 shows his gratitude for his parents moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM3 @CAPS2 shows his gratitude for his parents love in the quote ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez is also grateful for the love and hapiness of the home. @CAPS2 evidences this in paragraph @NUM4 in the quote, ""it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music and love. It was here where I learned the definition of family"". @CAPS2 goes on to say, ""I will never forget this house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love"". Rodriguez is gracious for his family, home, and life in this memoir."	3	3	3
13284	5	In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not happy happy but soothing. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves @LOCATION1. By the tone of the narrators voice shows that. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well. As you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting.	2	2	2
13286	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives is greatfulness, through out the memoir @PERSON2 talks about how he is greatful for his parents. @PERSON2 mentions that he grew up in a close knit community. @PERSON2 also talks about the sacrafices his parents had to make for him. In paragraph @NUM1 @PERSON2 says ""my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the jobs the deserved."" @PERSON2 mentions that in Cuba his parents had really good jobs, and how they made sacrifices. Paragraph @NUM2 sums up the mood of the entire memoir. Paragraph @NUM2 starts with ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This line proves the mood of the memoir is greatfulness and that @PERSON2 is greatful for every thing his parents had done for him."	2	4	3
13289	5	"The mood of the author is very greatful. I know this because @CAPS1 keeps repeating, ""I am greatful for all my parents did."" @CAPS1 is also compationate. In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 sais, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of 'family'."" and it continues ""I will never forget this house or gracious neighborhood."""	1	2	2
13326	5	The mood of the memoir was a happy and graceful mood because they live in a good neighborhood in america and they are surouded by their family members who have dinner with them.	1	1	1
13332	5	"The mood the the author created for the memoir was ""about how because his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 he lived a life that he would have never have lived before I his life his parents would take people in for a shot peirod of time to help them get back on their feet because they knew that the would do the same for them."	1	1	1
13335	5	"According to the memoir, the author created a mood to use in the memoir.The author created the mood of happiness. According to the memoir the author was very happy with his life. He was very joyful that he gained all the Cuban culture. He also is happy about all the ""family"" he has. So you can tell by the mood he has in the memoir that the arther is very happy and saticfied with the way he was raised.Thats how the authors mood would be described in the memoir."	2	1	2
13364	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful. That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are.	3	2	3
13365	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is greatfulness.Throughout the memoir, the mood created is greatfulness. There are many quotes in the memoir that support the mood created. One quote is ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1's greatful for his parents giving him a better life in @LOCATION1 and raising him up to be a good guy."	2	1	2
13398	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that when he arrived in the United States he was given the opportunty that so many immigrants wanted and that was education. His parents still carried that cuban culture they had that was especially in their kitchen because both his parent loved making food, and they had great culunary skills which he learned. They would have cuban music going while they were setting the table. The @CAPS1 tells us that when his parent were still in Cuba his dad worked in a laboratory and his mother had studied chemical enginerring. The @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."""	3	2	3
13412	5	The mood created by the author is a warm happy mood. This is because he is talking about the love and bonds of family. He also is talking about home and how a house can become a home. He also talks about how he and most people are grateful for family and friends. All of this blends together to form a happy, good, warm mood to the story.	2	1	2
13413	5	I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in paragraph @NUM1, in the beggining Narciso's parent gave up there	1	1	1
13414	5	The mood the auther was in was @CAPS1 & happy. The reason It was happy & @CAPS1 is because they talked about Being @CAPS3. And living in a @NUM1 @CAPS4 apartment.	0	1	1
13429	5	"This article @PERSON1 has created a different mood for me. I was first bored  but now I'm more grateful of my parents. My parents had also moved from a different country to the United States. They moved from @LOCATION2 to here @CAPS1 the children could have a better life and education. This article also says that close friends can also be family and now that I think about it, I think it's true. The author says ""growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood relatives. That's the kind of mood this author created for me as I read this memoir."	3	2	3
13443	5	Based on the auther in the @CAPS1, the mood created by the author was happy and sad, I sead that the mood created by the auther was happy because he lived in a comfortable with made by thier neighborhood was mostly, Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants at a time, it was no rasism, no segregation he lived his home peaceful, and the sad thing was that NARCISO RODRIGUEZ learned how to love and the the definition of family and about how to love but he saed that he would never how parents turn house into a simple home.	1	2	2
13445	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of ""family"". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immagrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do alot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember. He also talks about how ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", meant that you could even consider someone not blood related to you, as your own flesh and blood, family."	2	3	2
13453	5	"The author creates a gratefull mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the @NUM2 sentence the author states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This @CAPS1 that the author is gratefull enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood related parents. In paragraph @NUM3 In the first @NUM4 sentences the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with carage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This @CAPS1 that the author is also generous because he realizes the love and sacrafice it takes to do this. Also, In paragraph @NUM5 sentence @NUM4 he says that he has told his parants that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents."	3	3	3
13456	5	"In the excerpt ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" from Home: the @CAPS2 of our Lives, the author gives off a very nostalgic mood. Throughout the excerpt @CAPS4 recalls all the feasts, parties and guests @CAPS4 had at the ""simple house"" his parents turned ""into a home"" as stated in @CAPS3 @NUM1. This tells me that the author had  very good memories at the house @CAPS4 loved and grew up in. The author also gives off a very compassionate mood. In @CAPS3 @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""  @CAPS4 describes his comunnity as ""close-knit"" and ""honest"". This tells me that the author was very similar to his community and loved all of them and was grateful his parents took their time to make his life the best they could. The mood is lastly @CAPS5. In @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says his community ""extended a hand to people who were clearly in need."" @CAPS4 calls his parents actions of coming to @LOCATION1 ""courageous."" @CAPS4 takes pride in his Cuban family and @ORGANIZATION1 and all of the immagrants @CAPS4 grew up around, which tells me @CAPS4 knows they accomplished a big feat in their lives. Those are the moods set by the author."	4	4	4
13477	5	The mood that the author created in the memmoir was very thankful. He was very thankful for his parents coming to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. The opertunties it gave him a better education and to be successful. In the memmoir he was thankfull for al the people that helped him in this new country and supported him and his family as he did the same to the people that supoorted him. Thankfull was the mood that Narciso Rodriguez show'd in this memoir.	2	2	2
13486	5	The mood that was creatied by the author was a warm feeling because the text describe pride and gratefullness. Also it give a @CAPS1 and sense of a good family relationship. The author also puts feeling into his writting. Those are the feeling dat the author describes.	2	1	2
13500	5	In the short story of @PERSON1, there is a very happy mood. The story has a lot of examples of how his family was so nice. He says how his parents made their house a home, and how they put a lot of their Cuban heritage into the house. The story says that he was incredibly greatful to have parents that gave him so much love and sacrafice. The mood in the story is deffinetly a very happy one.	2	1	2
13501	5	I think the @CAPS1 was happy. I think he was because he has a nice house and a nice family. Another reason why I think he was happy is because he is now in @LOCATION1 but still around his Cuban culture. His parents put him in @LOCATION1 I think because they wanted to live there and start a family. That is why I think that this is the mood of the @CAPS1 in this memoir.	1	2	1
13512	5	The mood created by the author of the memoir is a mellow, unintense and subdued almost sad mood emphesized by the hardships the Rodriguez family (parents) faced in their struggle to give their children a better life. Although slightly depressing, the mood is happy and in a way, cheerful when the author describes how kind and welcoming the Rodriguez family is in paragraph four. But, the memoir create the depressing mood in paragraph @NUM1 due to the explinations of the families struggles in moving to @LOCATION1 and what they had to give up in order to selflessely better their childrens life.Over all, between the cheerful mood of the memoir and the sad mood of the memoir, the memoir generates a mellow, calm and serene mood throughout the article.	2	2	2
13517	5	In the @CAPS1 by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso seems to get a certin mood, tward his parents, a mood of happyness and greatfullness.Thorought the hole @CAPS1 Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for everything they have done, and gave up just for him to have a better life.

Even though he had to work and he was an immaigrant he was happy. The only reason he was happy was because he was with his family and thats what is important to him. He was from Cuba and immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. The mood of the story is not happy, happy, and sad. this is what the mood created by the auther is."	1	1	1
13543	5	"I think the mood created by the author was very warm, greatful and happy. I think this because he often expresses how his parents sacrificed a lot of things and made his childhood ful of joyous memories. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In many paragraphs he explains how he admires them for their strength and perseverance in moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. I also said happy because he is happy that his childhood was so memorable. ""Innocence of childhood... endless celebrations."" This shows me that he enjoyed the parties and being a kid.

14834	6	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated. Another problem is keeping the derigible @CAPS1 so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area.	2	2	2
14849	6	"The @CAPS1 The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet obstacled ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State building. The obstacles that builders of the Empire State building had to overcome were that wind speeds where the dirigibles would land were too strong and would whip the balloon around like a rag doll. They would ""have to use lead weights"" which would pose another problem, questioning the foundation of the building. The weight of the building also the weight of the lead weights might collapse the structure. The gases they use ""hydrogen and hellium"" make the balloon fly, but hydrogen ""is highly flamable and can't be used in populated areas."" There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 are the obstacles and the reason ""the mooring mast of The Empire State building was destined never to fullfill its purpose""."	3	3	3
14850	6	In Marcia Amidon Lsted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, many obstacles had the engineers of the Empire state building looking for a new way to dock dirigibles. One obstacle they had to face was the steel work of the building. The pressure of the wind and the dirigibles load had cost the company @MONEY1. Secondly, they had to design a few special floors for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be for baggage and suitcases while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be very durable so special materials were needed to be brought in and used to create the building. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many obstacles when constructing the 1,250 ft. building.	1	1	1
14853	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.	2	2	2
14867	6	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful. This would make it very difficult to accually get the dirigible close to the mast. Also the structure of of Empire State Building. The framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. Builders made over @MONEY1 worth of fortifying the framework. Those are some obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	2	2	2
14872	6	Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be unique and practical, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying to low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area.	3	3	3
14873	6	The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to more at the Empire State Building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building.	2	2	2
14880	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lsted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City.In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it."	2	3	3
14885	6	"Based on excerpt builders of Empire State building faced alot of obsticles. Here are my three points to consider. They need to make plans that were very difficult and hard. The Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash in to the building. It was too high firstly. The builders needed to make long difficult, plans. They needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building. They had to make changes to the existing plans to fit the mooring mast. Secondly, The Blimps and @CAPS2 could cause an accident. Blimps fly about @NUM1 miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it. Lastly, The mast was very high. It would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast. Irving Clavan said, ""... Such a height made it desirable to post poned to a later date for the landing gears."" In @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State building faced a lot of obsticles. The plans were difficult the Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash and the mast height was too high."	2	2	2
14896	6	"Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with over @MONEY1 of modifications. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flamable hydrogen. When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4	4
14910	6	"The builders of the empire state building encountered many obstacles. These obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the steel frame of the empire state building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation."" Another obstacle was safety. Having an accident would be detrimental to many peoples' lives, because it is located in such a densely populated area. Also the winds made the whole thing very dangerous. Lastly there was an existing law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas."	3	2	3
14913	6	"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a dangor for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangorous for passengers and workers on the dirigible. Lsted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This goes to show that any project should be checked for safety precautions at all times."	3	3	3
14920	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifing at heights of over @NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible.	3	3	3
14924	6	"The architects of the Empire State building believed that dirigibles were able to dock on the building if there was a mooring mast. However there were many obstacles to over-come to allow this to happen. If a dirigible landed on the mast, it would force a lot of pressure on the building as it swayed in the wind. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored... would add stress to the buildings frame."" And as nature played a role, the wind could swing the body of the dirigible possibly causing the frame of the building to break and the building to collapse.Another obstacle that the architects faced was danger. American dirigibles used helium, while dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. ""... the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey..."" The architects realized that they Hindenburg explosion would have been worst if it occurred on the Empire State building ""... above a densely populated area...""."	3	3	3
14932	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were long; some were as long as one thousand feet. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable. If an accident would occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated. Other obstacles were made for the builders of the Empire State building which proves that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles.	3	3	3
14939	6	Al Smith was a very competitive person: one of @CAPS1 Al had to go through is competing with another building and he had to make his building taller Than the Chrysler building. Wich in @DATE1 if he didn't make his building taller he would of lost the tittel of The tallest building in new york	0	0	0
14940	6	"Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One ""reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers failed to notice this law. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another @MONEY1 to be spent trying to fix this problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made manuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible' Los Angeles' approach the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."	3	3	3
14941	6	There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality.	3	2	3
14942	6	The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared.	3	3	3
14953	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city."	3	3	3
14960	6	"In the nonfiction article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted it gives information of the potential problems from the Mast. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into effect. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there the wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a law in place that for bid aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other height that was taller. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a highe calling."" The builders had a lot to take in to effect they had height issues, frame and law issues. That they had to sort out."	3	2	3
14974	6	There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp.	3	3	3
14976	6	"When building the Empire State Building, builders were faced with several obstacles in their attempts to have dirigibles dock there. The builders first had to ensure that the building was going to be able to support the dirigible. After they completed this issues relating to safety arose. It was very dangerous to because some air ballons were made out of hydrogen which were flammable. If their were any issues, New York's population could be in grave danger. The wind also was an issue ... because it was so shifty a dirigble would be heavy in the back. Dangling above new york was very dangerous. The last complications that affected the idea of docking the drigbles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area."" because of the law, safety and nature complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
14977	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lsted, had many obstacles of the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. Another obstacle was the lack of landing area, it was a challenge to expand in New York City, causing it hard to land dirigibles. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	3	3	3
14996	6	"The builders came across many obstacles while trying to build the Empire State building for dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was just having ""... a single cable tether."" which they went on to say it would add stress to the building so they had to fix that. They choose to modify the frame and strengthen it as well. Another obstacle was having to get the right equipment. They had to go get some information from the @ORGANIZATION2 air station. The last obstacle would be the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of Helium. This had meant it was very flammable which was something the must consider. While trying to make this work for the dirigibles they came across building problems, safety, and dangerous problems."	2	2	2
15000	6	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4	4
15016	6	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were the winds in the high altitudes, the laws that didn't allow airships to be so close to an urban area, the safety of the passengers, and the safety of the pedestrians below.	2	2	2
15022	6	Based on the information given in the excerpt, there are multiple obstacles they couldn't have been overcome by the builders of the empire state building. Between the winds, problems with ancoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested.One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarilly huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the @CAPS1 that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the bimp, then it would cause @MONEY1 of damage to the city.Lastly, a new law was undergoing a legislation process. It prohibited the flying of any air travel bellow a certain Feet in residential areas.	2	4	3
15030	6	"Obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it. One proble they faced was that if something happened to the dirigible like the Hindenburg. Then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. It was also a problem with passengers because in a city they could easly crash. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tryed to get close enough it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building.Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast. The final obstical builders would have to over come was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles to fly low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building than they would have been doing so illegally."	3	4	4
15033	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph nine it states ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof."" This obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building. Another reason as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This shows this was another major obstacle for the builders. Another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" this could be very dangerous. If the back of the ship was dangling over the streets surrounding the empire state building there could be many safety hazards. These obstacles were the main obstacles the builders had to face if the Empire State building would be a landing dock."	4	3	4
15039	6	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, on the excerpt is says, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" This shows that builders had to build a mooring mast to have some time for refueling or service and have people get off and on safe.Another example from the excerpt is when it says, ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform."" This shows that the builders build a gangplank for people can walk up or down the gangplank safe from the dirigible."	2	1	2
15043	6	"Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. First obstacle was designing strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. The second was that the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lsted, @NUM1). The inefficient the gases, the violent air currents would either cause the dirigible to spend, or add lead weights which would ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (Lsted, @NUM2). Among all of these problems ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (Lsted, @NUM3). Therefore, not only was it unsafe or impractical, it was illegal."	3	3	3
15047	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time (@DATE1's) believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success."	3	3	3
15053	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome."	3	4	3
15055	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers.	2	3	3
15063	6	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped."	4	4	4
15071	6	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had many obstacles to face. Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than @LOCATION1, so they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable so if it caught on fire it would go down in a very populated area. Another obstacle was at that height, the wind was very strong and violent. When tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was there was a law stating that dirigibles can not fly too low over urban areas this made it impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building.	3	3	3
15078	6	The following are obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. They were worried about the hydrogen and the helium being highly flammable and considering the disaster The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. They were also worried about the back weight of the ship. And they feared wind would be blowing it into the spires of the building which would puncture the blimp shell.	2	1	2
15090	6	Based on the excerpt there are a few key obstacles the builders face, one being the safety of the people in the dirigibles and people below them, and two being nature itself.The safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use. There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below.The Greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wraped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind.Overall the mooring mast was not a practical Idea. It was just something thought up to compete with the @CAPS1 building, and was not thought through with the aspects of safety in mind.	2	2	2
15096	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building taste some obstacles in attempting to have a dirigible dock.  The dock would break the laws.  The dock would also be a danger to the people below.  It would also put a lot of stress to the frame of the building."""	1	1	1
15122	6	"The obstacles that needed to be overcame, to create the idea of a docking platform on top of what was going to be announced as ""The tallest building,"" was going to be tough. The steps taken to make this idea come to life, began with consulting with experts. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION1 in New Jersey. When it was time to start constructing, the issue of the stress the building would intake from the mass of the Dirigibles became a problem. They modified the buildings frame to accommodate the new situation. They also designed a stainless steel tower with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast"""	2	3	3
15131	6	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building by attempting dirigibles to dock there were to many to predicte. The obstacles faced by dirigibles to dock there were because of many variables such as climite, Buildings and most of all the dirigibles them selfs.The climite as said in paragraph @NUM1 consisted with dangerouse and uncontraiable winds and the reason was because of the Empire State building itself. The urban areas around consited of sharp hull breaching spires and due to the winds it made a hull breach @NUM2 times more likely.Finaly there constrousion. Dirigibles were made with steel fram wrapped in cotton and filled with hydrogen to make it lighter unfortuntly the hydrogen with highly flamable.	2	2	2
15154	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirig ibles to dock there. One problem was strengthening the building's frame. This was necessary because the added pressure of the dirigible's load and wind  needed to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. The existing skeleton of the building had to be edited. In fact, these edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a unique look, architects made the tower out of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the machinery at the base of this tower. The builders also had to make sure it was accessible to passengers; they made sure luggage and people could go to and from the aircraft. These are two of the challenges builders faced is constructing the Empire State Building. Despite the mast being unused in the present day, the design makes this building one of the most well-known buildings in the world.	2	1	2
15157	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their ideas. The builders thought they would be able to make a successful landing dock for dirigibles. Everything they did was all planned right but when it came time to test it, it didn't work. There were quit a few problems with there idea of using the Empire State Building is a landing dock for dirigibles.One reason that this one not successful was because the dirigibles wern't able to get close enough to attach the building In order for the dirigible to be ankered would be for a rope to be tied to some thing. But the balloons wern't able to get to close to the building because the point at the top of the building was making it too hard. If it got to close to the point, it could puncture the balloon which would not be could because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall. There is one more major reason they're plan did not work.The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would get so wild the back of the blimp would sway back and forth, making it dangerous for passengers. They wouldn't be able to weigh it down with weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down in the city @CAPS1 of the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the empire state building would not work.	3	3	3
15163	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, while trying to build a dock for dirigible. One problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, other countries filled their dirigibles with highly flamable helium. If a dirigible were to ignite in a heavily populated area like New York City, the result would be deadly. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and ever-changing, and could potentially destroy the dirigibles. Finally, federal laws stated that an air craft could not dock that close to a building. These three factors made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	3	3	3
15164	6	Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with dirigibles dock there were many complications. At @CAPS1 the building was unable to simply put a mooring mast on top of the building. The roof was flat, therefore the dirigible would add stress to the building. They would need over @MONEY1 to modify the building framework. Then they realized that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable which would be unsafe. They ran into a problem with nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds constantly shifted because of the violent air currents. Even if they were to tether the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. Therefore with people all over the streets in @CAPS2 this was neither possibly or safe. There was also an exisisting law against flying airships too low over urban areas. All this gave way to airplanes, so even though dirigibles didn't work it helped.	3	3	3
15174	6	The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles serverely affected the building attemp of the dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen insted of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flamable then Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignit then a castistrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devistating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architectures and enginners to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible offcourse then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown offcourse will docking then the pedistrians on the ground level could be injured.	2	3	3
15186	6	"Whenever architectural work is put in act, thoughts of the potential consequences should be thought out beforehand. In ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The blimps consist of dangerous chemicals and, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A possibility of flames could result in a ruined building, and even worse, a destroyed city. Although fires were a problem to consider, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This building is extremely high in the sky, therefore the winds get quite brutal. If a blimp was tied to the mast, the back of the ship continuously swivel and ruin the fabric of the aircraft. A mooring mast was just not a bright idea for a large city like New York. The population was too large, and the area was too crowded. The obstacles the architects faced were serious, and they helped the team to kill the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	4	4
15198	6	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles trying to attempt dirigibes to be allowed to dock on the Empire State building. The builders faced obstacles like the lack of land area in New York as said in @CAPS1 6. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says that a big problem they faced was they could just land right on the flat roof and some other problems they faced in this @CAPS1 was the cable at the top of the building added stress to the building eleven hundred feet below the building and some of this work cost over sixty Thousand dollars. Problems with safety is the lead wieght be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was niether practical or safe. And another unsafe thing is in @CAPS1 @NUM2, they said that Hydrogen in these dirigibles was highly flammable which is very unsafe. In  @NUM3 it says that there was an existing law against flying airship above urban areas.	2	3	3
15202	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building.	3	2	3
15204	6	The obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the empire state building was, they couldn't put the fuell on top of the building. Putting mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and putt a lot of Pressure on it. For this to happen they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over @MONEY1. After succefully building that they had another obstacle. It was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents. They never figured out how and the idea just disappeared.	1	2	2
15216	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe.	3	3	3
15223	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2	3
15232	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. For example ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" which describes that the problem that the builders would have to face if they applied the mast and with the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would mess up the foundation of the building. So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building. Another example is ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast"	1	1	1
15243	6	"The architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself. One of the problems was that most dirigibles outside of the country use hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make the blimps buoyant. If one of those blimps ever caught fire like the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, then it would put many citizens in jeopardy. This densely populated area would be much more hazardous than a rural area in New Jersey.The last problem they faced was the law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 no foreign dirigible could dock and refuel there because of the type of gas keeping it afloat, while no @CAPS2 dirigible could dock and refuel because of the law prohibiting it, the idea of a mooring mast quickly diminished from the citizens imaginations and they looked to modern transportation such as airplanes."	3	3	3
15244	6	"Besides The facts That docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on The empire State building would cost over @MONEY1 and add a lot of Stress to the buildings frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream.Unfortunatly, he couldn't do that. There are @NUM1 big reasons. in paragraph @NUM2 it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in fire in New Jersey. paragraph @NUM2 says docking The dirigibles is plain dangerous because The Wind would cause them to @CAPS1 all over, Rather than being docked on The ground and being weighed down. Lastly, It wasn't legal. Paragraph @NUM4 states ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. was another practical reason."" The dirigibles would not be high enough in The air to be legal, and it was highly dangerous because pedestrians below."	3	3	3
15246	6	In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a moor mast was necessary. One could not simply Place one on the empire state building because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized a disaster it would cause if it hapened in New York. Nature was also an obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as it could be in a field. It was a risk not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such elevation over urban areas. These were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	4	4
15248	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirt dribbles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle faced with the fact that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas.	3	3	3
15276	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building"	3	3	3
15279	6	In the excerpt there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. Al Smith saw an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the top of the building allowing dirigibles to ancher there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. With this idea the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts, by taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the pacific Ocean. Now as you can see the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there.	2	1	2
15297	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building obstacles can be described in the following ways. First of all, the main obstacle was the nature of the mast. They described it as, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the dirigibles would dangle on top of the building, which wasn't safe for pedestrians. Lastly, there was a law for airships that couldn't fly too low or too high. The above explains the obstacles of the Empire State Building for dirigibles."	2	2	2
15299	6	In the building of @ORGANIZATION1 gets very competitive. He wants to construct the biggest building in New York City. When the construction was going on he wanted to add a top or hat so that the mast would be able to drop off people directly into the building. But then there was a problem they had to consult it to allow it. Irving then let Al know that the building wasn't going to be done on time, because of the mast. That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction.	0	1	1
15302	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the safety of the city and dirigibles were a concern. In paragraph thirteen, it states ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". In addition, the greatest of obstacles was truly nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" As a dirigible attempted to succesfully use the mooring mast, the back end of the blimp would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There additionally was a law which dated airships cannot fly that low over an urban area. Thus, the multiple obstacles which were faced through this ""architectural breakthrough"" destroyed any hope of the building's true purpose."	4	3	4
15310	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Some dirigibles did try, but due to wind and safety reasons the idea was dropped. The safety of all human beings took part in the construction, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". When dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things. Mother Nature can be a funny thing, ""The winds on top of the building were constely shifting..."". With the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be hard for a ship to land. When building something always be prepared for obstacles."	3	3	3
15311	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currant were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building.	3	3	3
15358	6	"There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, an existing law made it so that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which meant that a dirigible could not tie up to the building or approach the area. Another problem was making the mast strong enough to support a dirigible. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area."	4	3	4
15392	6	"On the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was very difficult, in my understanding it wasn't successful.Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts of the @PERSON1 air station, the navy leader offered it's dirigible to be used in testing the mast. And in figuring out if it's okay for the mast to be used architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast because it would cause stress to the building's frame. Also the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. It wasn't safe enough and because those dirigible that come from outside the @LOCATION2 don't always use helium they use hydrogen which is highly flammable which is a bad idea to have in the @CAPS1 of downtown New York."	3	3	3
15398	6	"There would have been many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face if the decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from out side the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On @DATE1, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey. the owners realized how much worse it would have been is a place such as New York City.Another big obstacle would have been nature itself. ""The winds on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast the back of the ship would move around, making it hard for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead wieght then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging over the pedestrians of New York City.The final obstacle that biulders of the empire state @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of the @ORGANIZATION1. They would not even be allowed to approach the @ORGANIZATION1."	4	4	4
15403	6	In constructing and building the empire State building to make it allowable for dirigables to dock there took alot of thinking on the builders' part. First they had to see what the building could handle and try to calculate what it held so it wouldn't fall. Then they had to figure out the safety of the passengers and pedestrians, a way to get in and out as safe and easy as possible. Despite all the work the builders' put into crafting Al Smith's idea, the chances just weren't realistic at all to the public and the plan had to be shut down. Although it makes a good story and is a crutial learning block for constructers to be.	1	1	1
15411	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered major obstacles. The first puzzle posed to the builders concerned the structure. They realized that, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted... to the building's foundation."" This reality caused builders to spend over @MONEY1 modifying the building. Although the builders were able to rectify the framework of the building, the later obstacles were unable to be conquered. After the Hindenburg accident in 1937 ""the owners of the Empire @CAPS1 Building realized how much worse that accident could have been"" if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city became a concern. Until the blimps were less flammable, it wasn't plausible to take the risk of housing them in densely populated areas. The final obstacle of the success of the mooring mast was ""nature itself."" The violent winds that whipped around the 101st and 102nd floors would spin the dirigibles around the mooring mast. This was ""neither practical or safe."" Overall, the obstacles the builders faced proved to be fatal to the success of the mooring mast."	3	4	4
15431	6	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many challenges the builders of the Empire State building faced while they had high hopes in creating the world's tallest building. They added on hundreds of feet allowing dirigibles to dock there. Competing with the Chrysler building, Al Smith announced that the Empire State building would reach 1,250 feet beating the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Al Smith was desprite to do whatever he could to construct the world's tallest building, even to create a landing spot for dirigibles. @ORGANIZATION2's idea didn't work out as planned. Instead, the @CAPS1 assigned to dirigible passengers was made into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden.	0	0	0
15438	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was all so an existing law against these air ships.Docking the dirigibles to the top off the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen which was highly flammable, there was one incident on May 6, 1937 where the German dirigibles caught on fire. This was known as the Hindenburg's accident. Builders knew this can risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would dock violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. The law against airships were they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas.	3	3	3
15439	6	When building the Empire State Building the @CAPS1 wanted to keep it the tallest in New York. They modified the buildings that it would not be succeeded by the chrystler building. It's original property was not to be a mooring mast. The empire state building had to be refraimed then the government banned aircraft too low then commercial airliners took over the avaiting industry. It was too dangerious for dirigibles to dock because the strong currents can blow them out of place causing accidents similar to the hindinburg.	1	2	2
15455	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the empire state building. One major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts. one law @CAPS1 air crafts from flying too low over urban areas. another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flamable gas, and after the accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion the builders realized the risk of accidents. Mother nature @CAPS2 the largest obstacle through, the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll. The builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea.	3	3	3
15457	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome."	4	4	3
15463	6	"There were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was nature.

""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind Pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work they would use diffrent Steel. Another obstacle the builder @ORGANIZATION1 would be safety. Winds and hydrogen were main focuses. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, hydrogen is highly flammable, The winds on top of the building were. Constantly Shifting due to violent air currents."" They would also be careful of pedestrians ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"". Those are just two examples of what the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1."	4	2	3
15493	6	"In trying to build dock at the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, the workers faced many obstacles.

15496	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind was to fast for the builders at that altitude. This shows that they didn't want any dirigibles to fall on any stores below. Second, they didn't finish the building because the building couldn't hold all the weight that they wanted to put on top of it. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily. In brief, there were many problems that made the Empire State Building a bad idea to dock a dirigible.	2	2	2
15502	6	The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building had many problems with actually docking any dirigibles there. When they @CAPS1 building the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. One accident could harm hundreds of people in New York's streets. The wind on top of the building was also very strong. Making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough. the last difficulty  that the builders had was laws. There were certain laws not allowing air ships to fly too low over high populated urban areas. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea to start out with, sadly it never got much use.	3	3	3
15510	6	"In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire state Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it did'nt work."	4	3	2
15511	6	Their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. The first problem they faced was safety. Alot of dirigible especialy those from out side the unitestates used hydrogen which is highly @CAPS1. So this was not safe in a place with a big number of population like down town New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because In case of an accident there could be a large amount of deaths. The second ob stacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stable in one place. Instead it would just go around and around the mast. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas. So It was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire state building.	3	2	3
15556	6	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles durring construction. While designing the mast the architects realized they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on to the Empire State building as this would add stress to the buildings fram. So the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withhold these conditions. Then the builders ran into a problem with safety, the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. They the decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down but, having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastley, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to complete their goal. Overall the planning of the empire state building had many difficulties.	3	3	3
15562	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there. Overall, the excerpt has made it clear that the only sensible way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field."	4	3	4
15566	6	"The owners of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the first obsticles they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steal frame.This was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock. Another great concern was safety, they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of ""how much worse the accident could have been (paragraph @NUM1) if it had occurred in a city like New York. The greatest obstacle they faced however was nature. The violent air currents caused the wind to constantly shift which would cause the docked aircrafts to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). A law which prevented airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear to overcome. This prohibited them from not only docking there, but even approaching the area. Although this dream may have seemed possible to begin with, the builders should have realized the many obstacles making their dreams quite impossible."	4	4	4
15589	6	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues were a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flamable. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much more worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing dirigibles dock at it's mooring mast.	2	2	2
15619	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The architects could not just put the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. ""A dirigible would be held to the building by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the buildings frame."" (Lsted @NUM1) The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted down to the foundation. ""The building's steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (Lsted @NUM1) ""Over sixty thousand dollars of modifications would have to be made."" (Lsted @NUM1) The building was based entirely around the mooring mast. New modifications were only used to support the blimp itself and not other factors like nature winds."	3	4	3
15631	6	"The workers on the Empire @CAPS1 Building ran into many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large city. Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future problem for the workers. The process was a troubling challenge overall.It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One percaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed."" The project al ltogether was unrealistic so therefor it was a great challenge for workers docking dirigibles."	3	3	3
15639	6	The dirigibles had @NUM1 obstacles to face, They had posidletys of fire, poping, and law troudle. They feared the dirigible would get on fire for it has hydrogen, that is rather highly flammable. They do not want to relate to the acsident that happened in lakehurst, New Jersey in May 6, 1937. also withe the fear of pops rase more concens. for the wind might blow it of chores into another building with a sharpe top that could possibley puncher the baloon. The feared this happening in downtown New York were it is highly populated. another reson prodley the biggest was that Empire State Building wanted a law for air crafts flying low over urban areas, so that ment there was no chance they could do what they were planing on doing.	2	3	3
15642	6	Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They were much better than the balloons. In new York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now this would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The dirigible is thousand-foot long. It would add stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors @NUM1 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrate framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope. It's because the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose. It was never safe nor practical. The buiders faces so many obstacles.	1	1	1
15643	6	Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a dock for dirigibles had many obstacles. There were obstacles like flamable gas in the dirigibles, dangerous to be near a densely populated area, the wind were constantly shifting due to air currents, and it would be dangling high above pedestrians. These obstacles were very difficult to solve.      In the dirigibles, there are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flamable if the dirigibles caught on fire. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on inocent bystanders. It also is dangerous because the winds shift a lot, and it can get popped by other objects or buildings around the dirigible. Thus, why it is difficult to turn the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles.         Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a loading dock for dirigibles is very difficult to do because it is not safe.	3	3	3
15655	6	"The builders of the Empire State building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was overcoming the extra stress that a dock dirigible would add. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast author Marcia Amidon Lsted states ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent weather at the top of the building. Lsted says ""Even if the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and break the mooring mast."" This was a problem because it would make it unsafe for passengers to exit the dirigibles and walk down a gangplank connected to the Empire State building. The wind also made it difficult for a dirigible to navigate to the mooring mast without being blown into other buildings in the area. One of the greatest obstacles was making the mooring mast safe. Lnden states ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogn rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigibles were to catch fire over a heavily populated area like New York the casualties would be numerous. These were some of the many obstacles builders faced when attempting to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building."	4	4	4
15666	6	During construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders @CAPS1 many challenges. If they had just put a spire on top of the building. the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building. other obstacles in their way included low-flying aircraft laws, difficult weather conditions, and safety (if the derigible crashed over New York). For all these reasons the mooring mast was doomed from the start.	2	2	2
15675	6	Dirigibles, blimps, were being hailed as the transportation of the future in the 1920s. They had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling.One obstacle the builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith spotted the opportunity for his Empire State building. He was to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, thus allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. Also, it would let people off and on.The problem with this was that the builders couldn't just set the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof if a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the structure, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame.	1	2	2
15676	6	In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. Any man his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun.	3	3	3
15696	6	"In the making of the Empire Building the builders faced some problems. All of these problems or negative for what they actually wanted to do. Some of these problems were because of what the balloon was made of. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt they say ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could cause many deaths. Also another was strong winds that could carry the balloon and be hard to handle. Last situation would be that there is a law about low-flying vehicles and the balloon flys low. In conclusion the problems they had could not be fixed, so the plan was ruined."	2	2	2
15700	6	"While constructing the mast to docs dirigibles to the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flamable hydrogen, that could be detrimental to the condensed New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building, if exploded. Also, wind on top of the building was out of there control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it would be unpractical and highly dangerous to the public. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear. The obstacles that stood before the Empire State Building's mast were to great to optimistically believe the project could be finished. It was postponed and became obsolete with the invention of airplanes."	4	3	4
15706	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). They had to modify the steel frame of the building. They had to do this all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). This would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So the flammable dirigibles were too dangerous to fly over such a populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM4). In the end the problems the builders faced were too many, and unfixable, so the docking of dirigibles in the Empire State Building was no more."	3	4	4
15712	6	There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.	3	4	4
15713	6	"Marcia Amidon Lsted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. One obstacle they would have to faced was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" ( @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lsted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there."	3	3	3
15724	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were @CAPS1. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it reads that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to  building's frame work."" This @CAPS3 that the designings of the Mast was going to take some time. Another obstacle almost called the end of the mooring mast. In @CAPS2 @NUM2 Architects @CAPS5 that, "" The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its @CAPS6 pose, for reasons that a pparent befrore it was even constructed.' The greates reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" @CAPS7 this was such a huge @CAPS8 the owners thought of the densely populated area of New York and how People could get hurt."	3	3	3
15730	6	Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch. The body of the dirigibles swang in the breeze. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical. They worked really hard. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some @ORGANIZATION1 of mooring airships to the mast. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service.	1	2	2
15738	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there are many, mainly it is a safety concern. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", stated the article. ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."" This shows the dirigibles are inpractable and a danger to both the people in it and the people on the street below."	1	2	1
15759	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York because of violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Also many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
15767	6	"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	4	4
15770	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles from Outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized it would be much more dangerous in a crowded area. A second obstacle was that the dirigible with be swivelling around the mast because of violent air currents. The dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which is definitely not safe. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Thankfully, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quickly disappeared, and the builders had no more obstacles to face.	4	4	4
15783	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flamable because they use hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire and once the Empire State Building noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit. Another obstacle was one that couldnt be fixed, because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definatly not safe. The last thing that stopped them was a law that was against any airships the flew too low in urban areas. All in all, the builders faced too many obstacles to build a mast for dirigibles"	4	4	4
15787	6	"The first main obsticale that the builders faced was the fact that blimps even though they have propellers and rudders are still at the mercy of the wind. And since the wind on top of the building was described as ""Constantly shifting due to violen air currents"" ( @NUM1) it would be impossible to keep the blimps stable while it was moored on the Empire state building. Just docking the blimp onto the building was an impossible feet, the only blimp that even tried to dock onto the Empire state building, the naval dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the building to get the mooring lines on because they where ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of the othe building in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" ( @NUM2) causing the dirigible to fall onto the city.The second main obsticale was the public safety aspect of trying to moore a dirigible on the Empire State building There were too many things that could go wrong. The blimp could explode like the Hindenburg, or could run into one of the spires on the surrounding buildings and plumet to the ground potentially killing or severely injuring hundreds of people. That is why trying to dock a dirigible on the Empire State building was an impractical idea."	4	4	4
15790	6	"When builders were building the Empire State Building they came across many obstacles. One problem was lack of suitable landing area in @CAPS1 (paragraph 6).

15802	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced a lot of obstacles attempting dirigibles to dock their. One of the first obstacle the builders faced was realizing that the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. The builder's realized that the wind pressure could make the dirigible swivel which would not be suitable for the foundation of the building. strengthening the building's structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The workers also realize that the dirigibles are flamable and if something were to go wrong it would cause a devestation to a such populated area. These obstacles put and end to the dream of having mooring mast on top of the Empire state building.	3	3	3
15804	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that the ""stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to spend over @MONEY1 to create a frame that would be able to stand that amount of pressure. Another obstacle they were facing was that most dirigibles had hydrogen in them, which is very flammable. They were afraid that if the balloon caught on fire, it would fall down to densely populated city below. And there was nothing that they could do to change this. A third obstacle they were facing was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant that the dirigible be constantly moving around while passangers tried to get on and off, which would not be safe. These are some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced."	3	4	4
15811	6	The builders faced many obstacles in building a moor to dock dirigibles. It was unsafe for a dirigible to be so close to the ground, especially in New York. The air currents from high above made the machine harder to operate near buildings. Another factor that contributed to the danger was that dirigibles are highly flammable due to the hydrogen which made most of them stay afloat then. Many blimps attempted to dock at the Empire State building, none of which were successful.	2	2	2
15816	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was how would they be able to have thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, without ""adding stress to the building framework."" They couldn't just add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven thousand feet below."" @CAPS1 they had to find a solution, which was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. Costing over sixty thousand dollars' worth modifications to the building's framework. Also ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" make the 101st floor a glassed-in observation area and the @NUM1 floor an open observation platform."	3	2	3
15837	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted the builders had obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles.

15845	6	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was nature. That is because the wind at the top of the Empire State were changing a lot due to bad weather. The blimp would be moving around even if it was tied down the other challenge was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". That is not safe because if a blimp caught on fire at the building there are 102 floors that could burn down. Also because downtown New York is a very densely populated place. That is the obstacles the Empire State building faced in creating a docking area for blimps."	3	2	3
15846	6	"The mooring mast atop the empire state buildings problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles."	4	4	4
15848	6	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which the were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project."	3	3	3
15858	6	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building the building originally was going to have a flat roof but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast.Another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the derigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be designated to passengers. Experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds.	2	3	3
15864	6	"The workers' constructing the Empire State Building faced many problems while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles, two of which were that the winds at that height were unpredictable and foriegn dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to Violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock up that high. The high winds could cause loosening of the dirigible which could cause it to go flying off, which is unsafe to the pedestrians. Also, ""Most dirigibles from out side of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard the workers ran into. If something were to go wrong the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down to a large amount of pedestrians. These two are reasons or problem workers ran in to when deciding whether to not it would be safe or easy for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast uptop the Empire State Building."	3	2	3

The architect on the building had to redesign the whole building so that it could accomodate these dirigibles. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" ( @NUM2). This is a monumental obstacle because safety and other issues would prohibit the mast from fulfilling its duties. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" ( @NUM3). Heavy winds, pouring rains, and beating heat could all end in disaster for the urban area.

15867	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2	2
15872	6	The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building.	1	1	1
15903	6	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders went through many obstacles. Dirigibles are steel frames balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Dirigibles could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rodders and passengers could ride in the gondola, under the balloon.A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.	2	3	3
15905	6	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York, led the way in constructing the Empire state building. This building was being constructed to be the tallest building, taller than the Chrysler building which stood at @NUM1 feet tall. In order to make the Empire State building taller than the Chrysler building, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top for docking dirigibles. This idea faced many obstacles. First, the passage states that ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthen to accommodate this new situation."" This would cost a large amount of money to construct. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, the passage states the issue that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed. The builders should have thought of each situation before building the mast which cost a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer used, the Empire State building still stood at the height of @NUM2 feet, the tallest building built."	3	3	3
15911	6	It @CAPS1 like a veryhard test for them because there trying to make an age of transportation with the thoughts of the pioneers. But once the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes for the building skeleton. They have framed the 85th floor the roof had to be completed before the framing.	1	1	1
15912	6	During 1929 when Al Smith announced that he was going to make a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles in the way of the architects building design. Building a dock for blimps at the top of the worlds tallest building is no easy task. They should have realized previous to the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyways.The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrolable wind conditions. Unfortunatly they never found a way to successfully complete this task and because of that the Empire State Building could never dock blimps. 	1	1	1
15916	6	"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted it is easy to see the many complications with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 ft. building. For one there is the natural effect of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere if the back wasn't able to be weighted down. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a @NUM1 ft. long dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The worker's then had to spend over @MONEY1 to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal. According to ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All these safety troubles and violations would all together make the ""mooring"" an impossible feat."	3	4	4
15927	6	"Derigibles, modernly called blimps were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was. These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passenger both eficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many obstacles stood in its path to glory."	2	3	3
15938	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon lsted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	3	3	3
15942	6	"Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many obsticals came forth with building the Empire State building with Al Smith constructing the whole building. With Al Smith constructing the whole building, he was determined to outstrip the height. Al Smith secretly constructed a 185 foot spire inside the building, the shocked the media and public by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler building. Another obstical that was faced during the building of the Empire State building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. The idea of having the dirigibles being docked at the top of the Empire State building, the dirigibles would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add amounts of stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstical that came to building the Empire State building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U. S. Used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is very flammable and if anything to happen it could destroy New York. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced my obsticals in the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."	2	2	2
15944	6	"The Empire State Building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in New York City's @CAPS1, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law.The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated @CAPS2 this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, & ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over @NUM3 feet with pedestrians below There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking.Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the Empire State building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" ( @NUM4). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat."	4	4	4
15947	6	"Base on the excerpt the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They not going to do it because it might hit other building or fly into other self. ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lines @NUM2). That mean it wasn't safe."	1	1	1
15963	6	"This project towards ""transportation of the future"" for the Empire State Building was no easy task. One of the major obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame"". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to accommodate the dirigibles. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked. Allowing these giant aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was ""neither practical nor safe. These obstacles caused the workers and architects to postpone the build."	3	2	3
15979	6	"the obstecles the builders faced was many of them. one of the things they faced was that they dident No if they wanted to build the tower in the first place. And the other reason were ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather then helium. And hydrogen is highly flammable. And one of the greater obstacles was mooring mast was nature its self."	1	2	2
15982	6	"The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the World and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased. They made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of New York  Also, according to the aricle, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated."	3	3	3
15997	6	"Other than making ammendments to building plans, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing as an extreme safety hazard ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing laws. Laws forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire state building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles."	3	3	3
15999	6	The empire state builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been above a densely populated area such as down town newyork. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another obstical the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped.	3	4	4
16013	6	"To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the @CAPS1 had many obstacles to face. Some of the obstacles were there a morning mast could not be simply dropped and a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top. would add stress to the buildings frame."" The architechs couldn not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building had obstacles to face."	1	1	1
16017	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible."	3	3	3
16020	6	"The builders had many troubles with the building of the Empire State building. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This is one trouble they had because if the dirigibles ever was an acident abuve New York City it would be bad because New York is so poluted.Another problem was"",they could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the empire State building's Flat roof."" This was a big problem because now they had to fix their desing. lastly another problem was the compotition, ""Al Smith relized that he was close to loosing the title of the worlds talest building. Al Smith was so caught up in his desing he did not relize the compotition. So when he found out he knew had to make his taller."	2	2	2
16032	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the beginning, builders were faced with obstacles of very high expectations. Expectations including the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: being ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as said by John Tauranac.With the desire to now be a dock for what was known at the time as the ""transportation of the future"", came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated @CAPS1.Y.C. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise, was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas."	2	2	2
16033	6	"The obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the lack of land area, the currents of the wind, and the gas used to make dirigibles float.The lack of land area was a problem because ""...some [dirigibles] were as long as @NUM1 ft., The same length as four blocks in @ORGANIZATION2."" This could be a problem because in a densely populated area like New York, people could be in danger of having large objects flying to and fro, so close to the ground. It would also obscure light.                                                                                                          The wind currents were a factor because 102 floors above the ground, the wind would buffet large dirigibles around, which would be a danger to the buildings frame. ""...the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation."" The final obstacle would be the gas used in many foreign dirigibles of the time, which was hydrogen, a highly flammable and dangerous gas to have in densely populated areas like @ORGANIZATION2. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, [they] realized how much worse the accident could have been in New York."""	3	4	4

The @NUM1 main obstacles the builders faced where, hydrogen being highly flammable. The second main reason was winds from nature itself. The last reason was the law against airships.The first main obstacle the builders were faced with was there was hydrogen and helium in the balloon and the hydrogen was highly flammable, so the builders needed to make a safe place for the dirigibles to dock. The second main obstacle the builders were faced with was nature itself. The winds from on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle the builders were faced with was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

16037	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced alot of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles. One is that in the story it says that dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it got a hole in it then it would catch on fire. Another problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships lying too low over urban areas. Those are some obstacles the builders faced.	3	2	3
16038	6	Their were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mass. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Those are some obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	2	3
16043	6	"Based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One of the reasons for the ideas failure was the fact that there was already a law in place making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the area, as it states in paragraph @NUM1. Also, it could've of been an extreme fire hazard if a blimp had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proved in paragraph @NUM2, where it states, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" which caused the owners to realize, ""how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" On top of all this, weather proposed an even bigger problem. Violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast was ""neither practical nor safe."" I believe the most important reason that the idea failed was because technology was simply advancing beyond predictions. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."""	3	3	3
16044	6	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lsted discusses several adversities and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their many obstacles they faced, was ""the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was niether practical nor safe."" However before thinking of landing dirigibles, architects had to figure out a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof."" @CAPS1 ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Most of the problems were avoidable, except for that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."""	3	3	3
16053	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, many obstacles were described that got in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the Empire State Building had a flat roof and the framework of the building would have to be made stronger to put the mooring mast on there. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" It cost more than @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle was the law. ""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell. It should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not going to work."	4	3	4
16063	6	The first obstical came when the @PERSON1 builing had changed its height. They created the mooring mast and made the empire state builbing @NUM1 ft. higher. Then they figured out that the mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Then with the new laws and the hindenburg that the mooring mast would not work-out. So the gave up trying to make it useful.	1	1	1
16092	6	"To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of the obstacles had delt with the dirigible itself. For example, the dirigible was highly unsafe and flammable by the 1930s. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highley dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go threw."	4	4	4
16093	6	The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State building.  One of those major obstacles was the frame work.  When your going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed frame.  What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.  The other main issue was the air currents.  You can not strapp a dirigible and believe the back of it swaying back and worth.  When your almost a 11 @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height.  If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrian on the ground below.  Al Smith had a great idea but he did not realize all the problems.	2	2	2
16094	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to consider the stress of the building, and adding more to the top of the building would increase the stress. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to meet the needs. Also it would be over @MONEY1' worth of modifications. The builders also faced the obstacle of safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable, so it wouldn't be safe. ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" There was also a law that was in their way. Facing all these obstacles, caused the builders to not go through with this idea."	3	3	3
16102	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the architects faced many reasons in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects couldn't put a mooring mast at first because it will add stress to the buildings frame. The architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to accomplish the new situation they are doing. Before putting the mooring mast the architects designed a shiny glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower to have the overall shape of the building. Even before constructing the mooring mast on top of the building the roof had to be completed. when putting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building; it didn't work out. When they tested it the dirigible didn't get close enough to tie it up. So in the future ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 did not work out."	2	1	2
16109	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended to late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 much, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize."	2	4	3
16129	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems trying to make dirigibles able to dock there. One problem was that the blimps use hydrogen instead of helium to fly. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The blimps were unable to be used because they were a major safety issue for the people being transported. Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring asked, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles are usually put down in open fields with the back ends can be put down with lead weights; the blimps dangling high above pedestrians was nether practical nor safe.

16136	6	"Based on the excerpt some obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws @CAPS1 plane height, the fact that some dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium, and lastly at such great heights the strong wind currents were a problem as well. The restriction of plane height was that plaes could not fly to low above cities without being a safety hazard. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". (The MOORING MAST). Another obstacle related to the fact that some outside the U.S dirigibles used hydrogen fuel in place of helium which could cause a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"". (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an obstacle as well, the high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as the attempted to dock at the Empire State Building which would pose as a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4	4
16140	6	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon Lsted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face."	3	4	4
16156	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The builders could not simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The builders now had to find a way to add this mooring mast for dirigibles without putting too much pressure on the building. In addition, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They now had to add ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications to the building. In conclusion, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" @CAPS1 the architects went through much work not only to make the mooring mast for dirigibles successful, but beautiful. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 shows the many obstacles architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2	2
16175	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted,to obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock where nature and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas.     The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe.      The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building."	2	2	2
16182	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There were two main ones: Safety and Nature.The builders should have realized that the idea wasn't safe, before building. Most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York would be bad.The biggest obstacle was nature. There were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast.There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means it would be illegal to tie a dirigible up to the building, anyway.	3	3	3
16189	6	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium which is highly flamable. The owners realized the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used."	3	3	3
16292	6	There were many problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as nature itself. At @NUM1 ft. the winds were just too strong and unpredictable to get close to and dock a dirigible. On top of nature, laws prevented the landing. Airships could not fly low over urban areas so even attempting to approach the area would be illegal. This idea still posed a great deal of potential danger even if there were no laws against it and wind didn't exist. Many dirigibles were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In such a highly populated area as New York City if one were to catch fire the damage would be horrifying. I hope Al Smith was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the title of world's tallest building because he didn't get his mast	3	3	3
16296	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted some obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the winds were too strong and most used hydrogen instead of helium which is very flammable. The way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a cord attached to the mast. The dirigibles would then be ""dangling high above pedestrians in the street."" (@NUM1). This was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM1) This would not only endanger the pedestrians below but also the people on the dirigibles. The wind was so strong that it could throw it into a building. Most dirigibles fuel on hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" (@NUM3) The owners of the Empire State building saw this as another huge problem because of how much worse it would be if one caught fire in densely populated New York."	3	3	3
16299	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was how much stress would be put on the buildings frame. Lsted says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire state building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was peoples safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they were to make this happen there would always be the risk of someone catching on fire. Making the Empire State building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this happen."	3	3	3
16318	6	In the 1920s, dirigibles were considered to be the future of transportation. Although useful, dirigibles had an issue, there was not enough landing area in New York City. With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building, he would construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers go on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed full proof at the time but this new construction plan endured on many obstacles.The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the building's frame. Architects detected that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle which was modifying and strengthening the the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle. Finally the third obstacle, which was the expense. Modifying the building's new frame work would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Consequently, Al Smith saw a great oppertunity for the Empire State Building but he was faced with many obstacles.	3	3	3
16338	6	The Empire State building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York.	3	3	3
16354	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over cities, meaning they couldn't dock at the Empire State building. Another obstacle was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is very flammable, so using hydrogen blimps in @LOCATION1 would create public safety issues. Finally, nature would prove to be the greatest obstacle because of wind, which could get quite violent and cause the blimps to possibly get untied from the building or fall. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.	2	3	3
16372	6	"There were many obsticles in the process of building the process to build a mooring mast. The designers had to think they're way around them.It was easily known you couldn't just go up to the top and start construction. There were acomidations to be made. The exerpt describes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" (@CAPS1). Just adding it on would upset the buildings structure and foundation.Safety was a concern. People realized it was a bad idea to have something as highly flammable as the dirigible. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" (@CAPS1). After recent fires, it was noticed now dangerous this idea was.Control was an issue in the city; rather than an open feild. ""... the back of the ship would swivle around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). That wasn't going to'fly' with most people, It would be almost imposible to keep it @CAPS4 for people loading. Designers face a lot of problems in constructing buildings but in this case, the mooring mast just wasn't ment to be."	3	2	3
16381	6	"When faced with the prospect of building the tallest building in the world, Al Smith refused to give up. In order to achieve his goal, he decided to build a Dirigible docking mast atop his new creation. But with this genius idea came obstacle after obstacle, preventing the idea from ever taking flight. One obstacle faced by Al Smith, and by far the greatest, was safety. Most non-American Dirigibles used hydrogen within their Dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The owners of the empire state building realized how bad it would have been if a fiery explosion happened ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". Another great obstacle was nature itself. ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it impossible for the Dirigible to be tethered without the back of ship swireling around the mooring mast."	3	2	3
16383	6	"The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building flat roof. When they tryed to build it there was not enough space so they tried to force it but that @CAPS1 mess everything up. ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, without strees to the building's frame."" At times when they try to add things that made the building only heavyer and more likely to fall. They try to add more things to only make it look better but what they didn't know is that it was only gain to fall more."	1	2	2
16386	6	There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another Reason consists of law @CAPS1. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is defanitley not the City for this idea just because there is alot of people walking around the @CAPS2 and there is many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would @CAPS3 to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea @CAPS4 disappeared.	2	1	2
16387	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3	3
16395	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced such as the high winds, and how they could dock the dirigibles when it is against the law to fly an aircraft to low near urban areas. one obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and high winds. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced is the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to ever dock at building because it was illegal for aircrafts to fly to low near urban areas and it would have been a long process to ever get the government to let them.	3	3	3
16404	6	The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible @CAPS1 had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem of there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land. However there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal.	3	3	3
16409	6	The Greatest Obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe. (@CAPS1 @NUM1)	2	2	2
16412	6	The builders faced a lot of issues to allow drigibles to land place on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious or carefull on building the platform to allow drigibles to dock. The drigibles (Blimp) were very big transportation machines that were made out of Steel and Cotton Fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable. Because of all these problems the procautions the builders had to make, makeing the mast was a failuer and left for the future transportations to plains.	2	2	2
16446	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One problem was that they had to strengthen the rest of the building in order to put the mast at the top. This process would be very costly, the author says ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another problem in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock there was the winds at the top of the building. The air currents were very violent that high up. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" therefore it would not be safe for people on the streets of the city. Finally, the laws of the city interfered with the plan for the mooring mast. The law said that it was illegal for an airship to fly too low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock on the mooring mast, it would be breaking this law. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems, and their plan never actually followed through."	3	3	3
16449	6	The people who built the Empire State Building had many problems building it. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the of a suitable landing area. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at it's top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come.	2	1	2
16463	6	It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the Mask which sounds like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammible and to dangerous to use in such a highly populated area. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction.	3	3	3
16467	6	Even beginning to build the dock of the empire state building was A mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile And realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obsticle the builders faced in Attempt to Allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not Allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians. Another obstacle they fased where the unsafeness of it All. The winds A that height Are constantly different And could cause the Dirigibles to move Around. Having Airships dock at the empire state building was potentially dangerous As well As illegal.	2	2	2
16471	6	"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the buildings frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" @CAPS1 pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today. "	3	3	3
16485	6	"The architects had their hands full when building the addition to the Empire State Building. There were @CAPS1 obstacles that needed to be overcome when they started building such as making sure the dirigibles were safe enough also taking in consideration the winds that are constantly changing. These problems were part of why the plans were put to a hault.Certain weather conditions were a big part of the safety procedures that took place. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds would make the ship sway back and forth which would be extremely dangerous. Another problem was that @CAPS1 foreign ships ran on hydrogen which is flamable and that would be a high risk. ""@CAPS1 dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."	2	2	2
16491	6	The Empire State Building was to be the tallest building ever made. At the top, was to be an accesable docking station for dirigibles called mooring masts. The idea of haveing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building caused the whole building to be modified. It costed over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obsticles like the modifications. Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise.	3	3	3
16492	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in @LOCATION1, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.	3	3	3
16508	6	"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the Blimp would be to low. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" ( @NUM2) ""-the back of the ship would swivel around and around-"" ( @NUM2) ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" ( @NUM2) the architects should've thought their plan through better."	3	3	3
16518	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible (blimps) to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps.     In paragraph 6 the author states ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and let passengers off and on."" That's one obstacle of his company. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton, construction proceeded as planned."" The buildings structure didn't really help the dirigibles much."	1	1	1
16519	6	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in the attempts of allowing dirigibles, the transportation of the future in the @DATE1's, also known as blimps to dock at the building. The biggest problem was figuring out how to make the mast work.The main obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of strong, violent air currents, the back of the dirigible would turn around and around the mast even when it'll be tied to the mast. It is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights. Because these would be dangling high above people below it would be dangerous, just in case it falls. Also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.Another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the building's foundation. This was solved by modifying the steel frame of the Building to be stronger to keep the building from collapsing.The attempts at allowing dirigibles to more at the building had many obstacles but in the end it was all for nothing because there is a law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3	3
16539	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle was the expanded use. New York was the lack of suitable landing area they would have. With this Al Smith saw opportunity for his building. He would add a morning mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea there would have to be lots of planing.	1	1	1
16542	6	A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building.  If thousand-foot dirigible more debt the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add stress to the building's frame.  The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below.  The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.  The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building.  The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below.  These weights were used for open landing fields.	3	3	3
16550	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builder's would want to dock the dirigibles they couldnt because there was no right area to land them. ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature it's self can take control. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles if landed on the Empire State Building would be weighed down because in the back would lead weights so, it would weight it down. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building."	2	2	2
16566	6	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd."	3	4	4
16578	6	In this excerpt the builders of the empire State building were faced with many problem's trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. Also the building around it would in harms way too. As stated in paragraph @NUM2 the dock was never really ment for use. I think They just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler building.	2	2	2
16582	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope."" A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.... Would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress.The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element, ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it. The builders of the empire state building atempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles safety flaws, and the flaws of nature allow dirigibles to dock there which ultimately didn't work out."	3	3	3
16590	6	"The builders of the Empire stat building encountered both man made problems and problems from nature while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was the buildings strength. The building's steel was not nearly strong inef to ""transmite pressure from the dirigibe's load to the buildings foundation."" Also ""the winds at the top of the building were always moving and full of violent air currents,"" which would shove the Zeppelin into the edges of the building. It was prohibited for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and so making it illegal for a ship to even dock to the building. Price was also a factor, along with the buildings cost an additional sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework just to make the building strong inuf to accommodate an airship. Through all of those problems the builders encountered no wonder dirigibles docking at the mooring mast was not possible."	4	3	4
16600	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obsticales that the builders faced. Some of the obsticales that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the the buildings flat roof because it would stress the frame to much. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the buildings frame work. Anothe obsticae the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose."	1	1	1
16607	6	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used."	3	3	3
16612	6	"There were many obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First off as stated in para graph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows an obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @MONEY1 of funds would be needed. The funds leading to the stregthing and modification of the steel frame. Thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation. Second the greatest concern was safety. This is brought to hand because most drigibles are very flammable. They consist of Helium, which is a extremly flammable gas. Also if the drigible were to mount to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would be swaying around and around. This possibly having a chance of dis-mounting and it crashing into a densly populated area of people. These are some reasons that the obstacles of attempting to allow drigibles to dock on the top of the empire state building."	3	3	3
16624	6	"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. for example it would have been almost impossible to dock with the violent winds blowing at that height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". It would not have been @CAPS2 to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the law of airships flying to low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" That's saying that even if a dirigible could moor at the Empire State Building, It's illegal because all airships have to fly a certain height over urban area. The workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were just to great to overcome. Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will."	3	3	3
17857	7	One day I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to pick who was going to be on a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gum as the coaches told kids privately in the hallway. They had to do it privately because there are two teams the A team and the @CAPS1 team. Finally there was about @NUM1 other girls still waiting I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was @CAPS2!  At last it was my turn I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the @CAPS1 team. Although it wasnt the A team I was still happy I didnt get out. That was a day I had to be very patient.	9	9	18
17869	7	Patience is an important thing. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. I have been patient many times. For instance when my mom uses the phone late till she gets of to talk to her. Before events like plays or movies you have to be patient until the movie are play begins. I am most patient during tests. Like this one the mean patience is very important. If you dont have patience to some people that is anrcoying. If i didnt have patience I would be a completely???person people would mind me very amount and every they would @CAPS1 get along with me so inside of bothering someone @CAPS2-stop be patient.	6	5	11
17880	7	Swimming is a lot of fun. I enjoy feeling the cool water all around me. Patience is an important part of the swimming you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instruction when learning a new stroke learning a new way to turn at the wall, ect. On the first day of swim team this year the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening. Patience is important.	8	8	16
17912	7	I want to say I found her, tex right away but I didnt. I learned something though yeah it took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 intelligence) for me to piece it together.

17930	7	I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didnt keep my mouth shut so my mom didnt want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. Thats exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.	9	12	21
17937	7	One time I was patient for the doctors and I had a great time. Another time I was patient, I was at the dentest. My therd time I was patient when I was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and it was boring waiting but I was patient. Last but not least I was patient to go on the tower of terror. It was the funest ride there.	5	4	9
17940	7	I am all way patient wen I hunt and fish. I always go hunting I find a spot and setor clmeit in a tree. I waet for along time for deer and trukey and @CAPS1. Some times you dont see anything at all. The key is get out early and be patient. The most of the time I usely see @NUM1 deer wen its deer sesson wen I go out . How I see them alot is being patient a lot.	4	4	8
17945	7	A @DATE2 ago my @CAPS1 was brought into the @ORGANIZATION1 because of her incision from a previous operation panste open. Because of @DATE2 physical coller coaster, I have missed three days @DATE1 and one day @DATE2 of school so far because I was gone visiting her. Now I'm back and trying to catch up with all my classes. So far I've achieved that goal with @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me and willing to hold off grading me until and the time catch up in their class I think I'll make it.	10	8	18
17955	7	A time when I someone I know was patient was when my mom heard that my aunt @PERSON1 was going to get married and @CAPS1 was helping plan it. @CAPS1 was patient because during the time of helping plan a wedding, @CAPS1 was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and was two months away from graduting from a @ORGANIZATION1 called @CAPS2s @ORGANIZATION1, while taking care of a seven month old baby boy with the help of my dad and myself. Also, @CAPS1 was trying to get her parents here from @LOCATION2 , @LOCATION1 with a lot of other staff to do. After, two months of planning a wedding, taking excellent care of a new eight month baby boy, studying for a test, helping her parents, came here, and graduting. @CAPS1 was able to help plan a beautifullwedding on @DATE1. This is a time when someone I know was patient	12	8	20
17973	7	Last @DATE1 I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. And we drove for hours! O my go she butt hort! We got there and there were no packing spots, so we went to the back back lot! but then I was excited we were walking towards the park I was the wicked twister and surprised my @CAPS3 asked me to pick the first ride I said the wicked twister so we got in and I looked at the line for the wicked twister and guess what it took @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride I was so patient that day and then we cut the corner and there was like @NUM2 more people! So that day I rode almost all the rides in the park and ate a whole @NUM3 pound burgers fries and a shake! So theres my story about my patience!	7	8	15
17980	7	This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @LOCATION1.There was a huge camp ground were you can reserve an area and camp there.The bad part was that it was about @NUM1 hours away. So i packed a magazine, some  paper my @CAPS1 and decided the best of it. Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing aganist each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour but as @CAPS4 played all i thought about was the camp. Later I was looking at a magazine about camping I didnt know it was about camping at first so that made me more exicited. Then i drew pictures for about an half an hour, that was fun.I ended up takeing up a nap for another half hour.  When I woke up I just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp. Finally @CAPS2 said @CAPS4 are here kids! @CAPS3! @CAPS4 all @CAPS5. @CAPS4 set up camp, played on the play ground,went swimming,and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it. But the ride home seemed alot quicker. Tthat is the story of a time I was patient	12	12	24
17991	7	"Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient."	12	12	24
17992	7	To me when some one is being patient they are in line or waiting for something and they're being very calm. Where they aren't rushed and are very quiet.	3	4	7
18028	7	One time it was hard to wait, but I was patient and in the end it was @CAPS1. One time my family and I were going to @CAPS2 world. The morning I woke up I was so excited because I really wanted to get the air port and go to @CAPS2 world @CAPS4 we packed to car we drove to the airport. In the car my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. Once we got to the airport we got supper excited! When we got to the area were you wait for your plane the workers told every one waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to @LOCATION1 was gonna be around one hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to @ORGANIZATION1 world as soon as we could, but we would just have to wait, we walked around the air port and, and got something to eat. Then @CAPS4 that we only had to wait twenty more minutes! My family and I just set down and talked and before we knew it we were  getting on the plane. Being patient can really help the soutition.	11	12	23
18037	7	One time I was patient??? was my dad was going to sent me a @CAPS1 present. I was just waiting and waiting for it. While I was waiting I just and my??? day I sleep, are, play games invites class a lot, and watch tv, after two week I only got it, it was @ORGANIZATION1 dangs game and one houndred dolar, I call my dad and said, thank you after he played my game all night and save my hundred dollar until my birthday. That was the time I was patint	7	6	13
18042	7	Did you know that patients are one of the key to happiness. For an example I was walking and @CAPS1 this guy walked up. To and started talking to me about his family (just remember I wasnt very patient at the time.) @CAPS1 he kept going on and on until I snaped and said do you know to shut up! badly he said yes @CAPS1 ran home., crying. @CAPS1 I went home and when I got home I felt sad for the guy, @CAPS1 said sorry.! And for some reason he said got you I said what I was so mad but I was happy when it was over. But that taught me a lesson though, always be patient because you don`t know who watching, literally.	8	8	16
18048	7	left! Right! High kick left, roundhouse sight! The boys arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs striking the bag with tremendous power! @CAPS1! the old man yells my boy. @CAPS2 says you are lacking patience. The old man named @ORGANIZATION1 puts a blind fold on the boy named @CAPS3 and lets jolbs sand bags during at him. The first one hits him in the head, but the boy kicks the second one and busts it open. @CAPS2 grabs the third one and uses it to block the fourth one. The boy learned to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first.	11	7	18
18054	7	Today I am talking about patents. Patents means to take something easy or to handle something with comaness. Like for example I went to an @CAPS1 machean and I wanted to get money, @CAPS2 I put the card and the pen, then I wanted @NUM1 dolors @CAPS2 @CAPS3 gave me only the receipt @CAPS4 cash @CAPS4 cards @CAPS2 I dident brack @CAPS3 I just called the company and I got the mony and the card. New this is the main story I vent to the mall to get a shoe @CAPS3 vas one hundred and ten @CAPS3 was on sale one hundred dollors, @CAPS2 I wanted to buyit the casher man sad one hundred and ten dollars please @CAPS2 I told him @CAPS3 was on sale, he sad get out of my store @CAPS2 I told him I came to buy a shoe. @CAPS2 I returnd @CAPS3 and vent out. Theats atime when I was patient.	8	4	12
18055	7	A time I was patient when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 of @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 grandma @CAPS1, grandpa @PERSON1, and @CAPS4 brother @ORGANIZATION2. We were all just walking around and we saw a guy drawing cartoon pictured of people. I said grandma @CAPS1 cant we do that please.@CAPS3 said yes. @CAPS4 brother got to got first. I was just waiting for his to be done. Then his picture was done we looked at it and we all laughed. I was next I sat on the seat the sun was right on me. I got very hot and I did not just want to sit their but I was patient. I didnt say a word just sat their and smiled. A picture that took about @NUM1 to draw felt like a half hour. Then I was done. I looked at the picture laughed and smiled I liked it. I was patient and I got what I wanted. A time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1.	8	8	16
18056	7	"I patience is a privilege I generally don't have, @CAPS1, I made an exception, though. @CAPS3 brother, @PERSON1 ran out to the car running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was,"" @CAPS2 need to talk."" @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded."" @CAPS4 about at @NUM1?"" I knew @CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 got an in-school suspension, around me. If @CAPS3 brother hadn't of cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 divulged into his story causing tension in the air. ""@CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really very friend poured water purposely on @CAPS3 sweatshirt, @CAPS12 I went to tell the principle, @CAPS3 @LOCATION1""  ""@CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do,"" @CAPS3 @CAPS15 interrupted. "" @CAPS9. @CAPS12 the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started to follow me, and I felt threatened.""  I held @CAPS3 breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS5 filled in the next part, ""@CAPS12 you. Started punching him?"" ""@CAPS13, yes."" @CAPS14 admitted miserably. ""@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,""@CAPS15 scolded. ""I know, I know now. I 'm sorry,"" @CAPS3 brother shuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, ""would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?"" ""@CAPS16""I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day."	12	10	22
18064	7	When I was patient. I was @NUM1 yrs old when I got a as. I ordered it online and waited. @NUM2 days went by and still nothing, a week went by and a ups truck stopped at our house dropped off the package and left. I was so happy that I didnt even noticed that it was for ma mom. I opened it to find pampered chef stuff in it. I was really angry! @NUM3 weeks went by and nothing I was upset that I didnt really didnt know it I was gonna get about it. But a ups truck came and didnt see it and guess what in the package was my as! I didnt even realize it till @DATE1 I was so happy that I got it. That I forgot to order a game with it. And that was the time I was patient see ya.	9	8	17
18076	7	There was a time when I was patience and I was waiting for a long time me my cousin, @PERSON1 was walking around town and we was looking for silly bans ok first we went to the @DATE1 store but when we got there they was closed so we started walking again and then we saw my brother and my other cousin @CAPS1 they was on bikes and we walk so then @CAPS1 said its a @PERSON2 store down there so walk down there. Then @CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on the bike and they walk. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and see how much they casy and they coats @MONEY1 and some of them coat @MONEY2 so we went to @PERSON2 tree and they was a @MONEY3 but we didnt get them because @PERSON1 didnt like the ones they had so we went all over the when we found them she didnt want them. So we went to my grandma house and she asked me where we was all day and I said we was out looking for some dom silly bans. And my grandma said dont go where @PERSON1 want to go. If your mama tell you to come over here come over here and I was trying to be patience by not trying to yell at @LOCATION1.	6	7	13
18099	7	@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1! @PERSON2 said, I wanna go first! @CAPS2 the time in cheerleading this girl named @PERSON2 thought she was the first to do everything. Oh yeah my name is @PERSON3. Im always a fiuter along with @PERSON2. Im always patient and wait my turn because I dont wanna complain or be a poor spot. @CAPS3 set! @NUM1, @NUM2 down up @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6 the two bases and backspots yell. They pop @CAPS4 out and up thenscream @CAPS5! @CAPS6 job. @CAPS7 says. @CAPS8, its my turn, @PERSON3, you can do this your better then her. I thought to myself @CAPS9 we can do this. One of are bases @PERSON1 said. I get @CAPS3. Hand on shoulders @CAPS3 to get poped up into the air. Are other base @CAPS10 says @NUM1, @NUM2 down up! Okay, @NUM3,@NUM4,@NUM5,@NUM6- @CAPS5! @CAPS6 job @CAPS12! @CAPS13 cheers but loss. I was so excited, I just did a pop @CAPS5 without messing up my @CAPS5. I thought with excitement. Being patient might be @CAPS6 after @CAPS2. From that day on Ive always be patient. It can really help you out so you know what you have to work on or work less on.	8	9	17
18127	7	When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasnt in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didnt put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didnt know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasnt patient in this game we wouldnt have won and I wouldnt have gotten the trophy to take home with me.	8	10	18
18148	7	"Patience is basicly waiting and tolerating it. Every year on @MONTH1 @NUM1 my family become seasonal at a camp ground. There @CAPS1 play and have fan and make many life long friends. Every weekend @CAPS1 go out there and @CAPS1 take are speed boat, ""the glass from. ""@CAPS1 pat it into the the lake and dock it at a dock. Then @CAPS1 go fishing on every part of the lake and sit there for six hours. This is were patience comes in @CAPS1 have to sit and watch oar bobbers float on the smooth glass like lake. @CAPS1 sit there and watch and talk and bake in the sunlight. It is quite peaceful thowe that I'm off school and I @CAPS2 to spend time with my parents. Then in school I have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over. So @CAPS1 sit there until the sudden noise of on of our bobbers sinking into the water. After that theres some yelling and ""@CAPS2 the net ""sayings. The funny. Part is that it is that it is ethier a large bass or a small nor there. And all this takes patience."	10	8	18
18154	7	I was patient when I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. First it started out when I got a can from my friend @PERSON1 he asked me to go. So I said yes. I had to be pation derms the @DATE1. Then he drive it way long but I was pation. When we got to the entrance I felt good for being pation.	8	5	13
18171	7	"Waiting in the line to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I complained,"" @CAPS2! When are we going into the park?"". ""@CAPS3 patient,"" @CAPS9 mother hissed back. ""Being patient is boring!""I complained again ""yeah,"" shouted @CAPS9 sister. ""@CAPS4 so bored! Its not and @CAPS9 feel hurt and- ""@CAPS5!'', shouted @CAPS9 @CAPS2. ""Were almost there!"" @CAPS6 @CAPS8 seemed like hours, we @CAPS7 got to the ticket booth.""@CAPS7!"" I meaned.  We went inside the park."" @CAPS8 first?"" I asked @CAPS9 sister pointed to a ride. ""That one!"" @CAPS9 sister yelled night before she ran to a ride. We followed @CAPS9 sister to the ride."" @CAPS10, lets ride @CAPS12. It looks fun."" said @CAPS9 dad as we walked to the line."" @CAPS11! More waiting!"" I shouted"" @CAPS12 is gonna take forever!"" I complained."	8	9	17
18172	7	I showed patience before. I am about to tell you and that time. Two years ago.  I worked at my @CAPS1s home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ???  he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! @CAPS1 thats more than double, I said, my heart throbbing. I know but you deserve it. I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you dont wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off.	11	12	23
18181	7	One day when I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited hours and hours and hours and hours then he said acler our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when is saw the dunes I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did. After I got to the top. I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like, a dead animal. After five minute I was good and climbing to the top dune off because after I got up I ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop I stop I stoped. But I got seed in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell, when my friend carte down we both lauphed and @CAPS2 back to our campsite.	9	8	17
18192	7	When can I drive? I wined. when the time comes you have to be patient, otherwise you wont yelled my @CAPS1 over the loud, heart warming sound of @CAPS2. Starting up for the @NUM1 time that year. I loved that sound. Its my second favorite sound. The vibrations rattaling my lags as it races away with @PERSON1 driving. I could wait until my turn. After I rides and @NUM2 mins. @CAPS1 said the words I thought hed never say, @CAPS3, your turn. I looked at him then the truck. Wow does he look small next to that truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climed onto the tires rim, then to the, top of the tire, and into the cab. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, gaggag @CAPS7. Oh yeah! This felt right.

18195	7	When I was around the age @NUM1. I went to @CAPS1 with my grandpa, grandma, and mom, and dad for a family reunen, we stoped so menny times I cant even count. I think it was to but I did not want to stop or be patient because I wanted to get there and see what everything looked like like it was big but the dad post was we hade to leave are dog home for a week, was in patient to get home to because as soon as I got home I was going to sleep. We got up to leave from are house at @TIME1 and we got to the motel at @TIME2 am the after noon I was sick of sitting in the car I did not want to get back in the car to go home because if you think of it that is long ways to white in the car. I was very impatient because if I could of gotten there in a half of a hour or a have would have been a lot better than like, @NUM2 hours of time but it was a lot of fun to see new things that you have never seen befor on your way there because on are way home. I was just sleeping. But I was not very patient I was so board that every stop I would switch cars and I did not have tating at that time but I did have my @CAPS2 until it died then I made my I pod and my cells all I could do was call and play games on that but I was so impatient at the coner to cuzz I rather go to the hotel and sleep than sit there lission to older people talk bout what has happened. I dont know hardly any of them I could not tell you who every one was.	5	4	9
18205	7	In the beginning, I woke up from sleeping and felt real sick, @CAPS1 I took a shower and put on my clothes. I told my dad can I go to the doctor because I feel sick???? @CAPS1 he said we will leave @NUM1 am and it was @NUM2 am. Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad and my mom were talking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and tried acting @CAPS1 beautiful. @CAPS1 I didnt. When they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was @NUM3 am and my dads favorite music was on @CAPS1 we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle, it was @NUM4 am and then we went to the doctor and had to stay waiting for everyone to get there turn until it was @NUM5 which is our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me and it was nothing. @CAPS1 I left and I still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was @CAPS1 pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said Are you happy? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you. @CAPS1 we went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself I learned my lesson and it is if you are patient the day can go fast.	12	8	20
18212	7	Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: t cannot wait for things. During school, I am always looking at the clock. I just cant wait for class to be over most of the time. Some times I think I rush things a little bit too much. I wish I was patient, but Im not. Im not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting, I get too curious. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style. I dont think that will happen anytime soon.	5	9	14
18213	7	Patience is very important at my house. My mother always says you have to be able to patient to succed in anything. One time I was at home on the computer. I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair. Walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to @CAPS1 to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make myself a sanawich. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room. Folder laundry and watched television. It was about @DATE1 and she still wasnt home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says be patient to succed. About a half an hour @DATE1 she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it.	11	11	22
18220	7	One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didnt happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldnt stop. I went head-first  into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didnt panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didnt take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldnt stop in time. When I hit my head it didnt hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didnt hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over.	10	11	21
18222	7	I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 for this @DATE1. The line must have at least @NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchard in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 second. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! @CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. Im sorry. Thanks for your cooperation click. I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! @CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! Its time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9! That was my story of being patient.	12	12	24
18227	7	A time I was patience was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. adventures and we all wanted to go on the leaver water slide. The biggest water slide there. It had the longest line cher, it made a swerl and my family was at the end of the swerl. I was early morning when we had finally get in and went to the leaver water slide. It was huge just about @NUM1 feettall. And we got in line and only an half an hour had gone by when my mom let it. Then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. Now it was only my my other brother my sister, and my dad is left in line. When some one got hurt on the ride and the shut it down for two hours. Finally they opened up the ride again so now my other brother and sister did not come with us. So now it is only my dad and me left in the line now. So it was our turn on the ride next when my dad get scard end left so it was me and an old man went on the same little fletch. The old man met his pance and l was so happy to finally get on.	10	8	18
18230	7	One day @PERSON1s mom, @CAPS1 decited to go shoping and @PERSON1 despretly wanted to go. But his mom kept saying @CAPS2. So @PERSON1 begged and begged s his mom finally said, @CAPS3 but you cant complain so @PERSON1 went shoping with his mom. Then @PERSON1 and his mom arrived at the store. Just about @DATE1 @PERSON1 said. Im board can we go now, his mom @CAPS4 @CAPS2 just be patient. @PERSON1 then said, patient you want me to be patient weve been here for like  @DATE1 hours, we have only been here for ten @DATE1. I have @CAPS2 more patients said @PERSON1. So so his mom made a deal with @PERSON1 it was, if you be good for @NUM1 more @DATE1 we will go to the ice cream place. The next @NUM1 @DATE1 made his mom go crazy with every second @PERSON1 saying, Im board can we go now and hurry up. Finally @PERSON1 and his mom left. They got in the car and drove right past the ice cream place, @PERSON1 said, wait we past it, his mom said I know. @PERSON1 said we made a deal, remember. It is mom said yup but you broke the deal, so what did you learn. @PERSON1 said that when you make a deal sign a contract, his mom said, @CAPS2 patients is a virtue that you need to learn. So that is my story about patients in my own way.	8	9	17
18232	7	Patients is everything, ever hear these words! When you waiting in line for a test food restaurant, or when you stuck in a traffic. Youre annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind. patient is everything, one time I was waiting in the longer line ever waiting to see the ordering counter! I was in a rush, I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could we the counter I saw the empeloyees rushing around trying tralicly to get all the orders. Then I saw the reason of the holdap. There was an old man at the front of the line trying to despreately order. I didnt blame him, wich all those choices, he didnt know what to pick, the lost of the line wasnt as patient, harry up. One said come on. @CAPS1 another I just waited patiently thinking, the line wasnt really being fair. I suggested a choice for him and he ordered. Sure, I way @NUM1 minutes late for my class but I was patient and understanding towards the old man, what comes around goes around they say, rest of the day I felt good about my good deed	8	12	20
18240	7	"I remmeber a time when I was six I was waiting In the walking clinil @CAPS1 almost @NUM1 hours so l asked them if  they could change the @LOCATION1 channel  to @ORGANIZATION1, after  @CAPS2 got over I @CAPS3 asleep @CAPS2 @CAPS5 like forever @CAPS1 them to say ''@CAPS6 salslory,"" my mom tried wakeing me up she couldn't until I @CAPS7 off the cach seat that they had In the kid's are.

18247	7	This is a story about patience, one day my friende tells me hey did you ever be patient. I told him no I have never in my life been pacients, well you should he told me. One day my frend is telling my new game is coming out and I just talk why he was talking  I can tell that he did not like it at all, so in class I  am telling every one that I won him in race.

So the next day I said do you have eny thing to tell me I will listen better now.

18251	7	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. I was patien when I whent to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. When I whent to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I had to wait in line. I didnt have to wait for that long but I had for wait , I didnt like it, but I was patein. It was worth the wait. I had to wait in line for food to there was a lot of people in line there. That was worth the wait too. There food was good. That is how I use my lifeskill of patience. Patience is a good life skill to practice.	5	6	11
18260	7	Patience @CAPS3 a sense of tolerance. Having the patience means that you can wait, it will come to you if you just wait. like when you gobble your food down thinking its going to he stolen, when really, you could have left it there and yet it would still there. Patience @CAPS3 knowing that everything @CAPS3 going to be ok and you have time. Having patience to do somthing, @CAPS3 to take your time, or go at your own pace believing you will finish. Patience @CAPS3 qenrally how long you can wait to do somthing, or even put up with something. Patience could also mean now long you can put up with somthing, like a bully for instance. He or she makes fun you again and again. But how long, how much patience do you have before your just pushed off the edge and you cant take it any more! THAT@CAPS1 @CAPS2 PATIENCE @CAPS3.	6	7	13
18276	7	The time I was patient was when my sister droped my phone in kool-aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Everyday for the rest of that week I was good. I still didnt get a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her faught, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to become impatient, but I didnt. The next day my sister took me into the metro pcs store to pick out a new phone. See by being patient I finally got a new phone, and thats the time I was patient.	9	9	18
18282	7	A time were I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I got my broken foot. I was waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be hard sometimes but everybody can have patients.	10	10	20

18402	7	A lot of people are patient and they wait because they dont want to make someone mad or mess-up something that they are doing. People always be careful of what they are doing. I ever be patient sometimes and its not that hard to be patient it is pretty easy. Everyone absouletly knows that, those people are out their, they know, trust me. Theirs many different things thatve been patient for, but I dont know which one I choose to write, cause there is alot of them. @CAPS1 someone is in the bathroom, wait patiently but @CAPS1 you cant or cant hold it, keep knocking on the door or just use other one, or @CAPS1 someone on the computer then wait for your turn, but @CAPS1 its been pass in an hour then tell that person to get off not to be mean, but you either need on and have your turn. There is no way you cant be patient for at leat @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes. Not too hard. Its pretty easy and everyone knows that too you know.	3	5	8

And dad even said @CAPS5 was big enough to @CAPS6! @CAPS1, then we went home, filleted the fish, and had walleye for dinner.	10	8	18
18531	7	The time I was vary vary patience was when I was about seven and me, mom, dad, sister, bothers, and grandma from up north (were we got my grandma) to west virgina and back most of the time I was sleeping or waking up sum were eating playing at a hotel pool. Sleep and then hit the road the next day. the thing that I had to be so patience about was that we were going to have @CAPS1 there so I wanted to open my presents. and one time we got stuck so that slowed us down about  a hour our . So when we @CAPS2 got there I jumped out ran is fast is I could opened the door and surpise marry @CAPS3 guys.	5	4	9
18567	7	Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. There were flys everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! @CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again I pleaded. @CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait! @CAPS1 quickly replied. @CAPS5! I never get what I want do I! You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much! well I dont wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might! by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didnt get front cart the wait wasnt even that bad.	12	12	24
18590	7	I had to be patience many times. I had to be patience when my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum, I was waiting for x-rays, waiting to go on stage. These are sometimes when I had to be patience. When my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room.  It felt like forever. It was winter, I was in my pjs, and so bored but worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the emergency room for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, but they were very good at there job. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the tv they had. It was very cold in the waiting room plus I had @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my @NUM1 grade concert.  I was so nervous and the neeves kept growing. I waited for @NUM5 min but it felt like @NUM5 years. I was sitting next to my friend which helped a little. When we got on stage I song my heart out and was happy I waited. Those are sometimes which I had to be @NUM7. I am not good at being patience, but I waited and got good results.	8	7	15
18596	7	A time when iwas patient was a last @DATE1. My friend, @CAPS1, took me to cedar point in @LOCATION1. The place was so packed, it took five minuites to get from the car to the entrance. As we got in, the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream. They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on  was the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited, and waited for about ten minuites and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minuites and we werent even close to the ride! So we waited , and waited about ten more minuites, and things got a little faster. At this part, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenallen already. After we were strapped in, the person who locks peoples seats said go! and we took off like a bird. In the end, it was worth being patient	11	12	23
18599	7	I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient.	10	10	20
18602	7	My story is about a time I was patient. One day I was so excited because it was @CAPS1 and my friends and I were going trick or treating. I was so impatient for the clock to turn @NUM1 pm because my best friend @DATE1 was going to pick me up in her pink convertibable and we would go trick or treating. I was very impatient because it was only @NUM2 so I did my chores thinking time will fly by so I did my chores. Instead of putting dish soap in the dish washer. I put grapes in the dish washer @CAPS2 the dish was hoe was done I empted it and all the dishes smelled like grapes. So I  looked at the clock and it was only @NUM3 the I remembered that my favour  movie was on so I ran to my room but instead I ran into the wall and got knocked out. After @NUM4 hours I  was fine so I told my mom that I will be patient because I don@CAPS3 want to get knocked ???on the bright side I told myself I only have @NUM5 hours and @NUM6 minutes to go so I went to my room + wasted some @CAPS3.V. until eleven twenty so I had an hour to get ready to go trick or treating but first before I did my make up I whent into the kitchen I put all the grape smelling dishes in the dishwasher and washed them them the I right way. Then I put my costum on I was a bumblebee, then I put my make up on I looked so cool. Finally the clock turned to @NUM1 suddenley I heard a horn @DATE1 was here. So I got in the car + we went to pick cate. I almost forgot to tell you that @DATE1 was a ladybug, cate was a which so then we whent trick or treating. So thats a time when I was patient.	9	8	17
18632	7	It was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I was up watching tv waiting an waiting for @CAPS1 and I was being patient and not pouty because I wanted @LOCATION1 to come to my house and, they were playing @CAPS1 tv shows and it was making me so excited and it felt like my heal was about to burst but I being patient. Then my mom said it was time to go to bed so I because I wanted @LOCATION1 to come to my house. But the only problem is I couldnt sleep so I went to get a glass of water and I turned on the tv queitly and on acident I feel asleep on the couch and next thing I new it was @CAPS1 and the had went by so fast that it felt like it was @CAPS1 in @NUM1 minutes. Because I was patient.	9	8	17
18645	7	Being patient is a good thing. Sometimes impatient @CAPS1 sometimes im not its better to be patient. My cousin is patient so when I tell her to wait and be patient she will wait as long as she want. My other causins tell me to be patient and I will just be waiting for a while and I ask then hurry and they tell me to learn to be patient. My cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient and we tRied. So now I can stay longer being patient.	4	5	9
18659	7	I am writing about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when it wast the first week of football. We went town to subway before the game and got a cub. I was the first one in line but then I was folowed by other people olny one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I was up next I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana, pepper, cucumbers and great frech spinach.   It rearned something in that line being patient realy pays off and by the time in at back. It had over been @NUM1 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first games we played starta we tied it though but that was still a great day!	6	8	14
18664	7	Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4t have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but heres a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like theres no tomorrow. To bad I couldnt play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience.. @CAPS1 ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face.  @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing he added. @CAPS4t get to happy , theres still plenty of time left. I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, who is the loser now, huh? wow all it took was patient, and hope I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate whats happening around you, youll end up getting rewarded!.	10	9	19
18668	7	In sports you always have to be patient. Like if your not making any shots or someone is getting the best of you. If your patient and keep working hard sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient in his basketball career. At @PERSON2 high where he went to high school he wasnt the biggest, fastest, the strongest, or even the best, but he was patient. When he was a @CAPS1 in high school he frield out for the varsity, but didnt make it. He was so upset with himself and the coaches because he felt like he shouldve made the team. His mom went fo him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids @PERSON1 didnt quit or tell himself that he wasnt good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard. All that worked paid off because the next year he made the team. He went on to go @LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a game winning shot. He went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3s were one of the worst teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple seasons @PERSON1 stayed calm and on to win five more championships. In his last one @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. The @CAPS2 were getting tired though. They went down in the series @NUM1. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting. Finally the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some tough situations, but he stayed patient and played like an all-star.	9	11	20
18688	7	This is a story about patience, pateince is when someone gives you a older or specific job to do. Then you do the job or order with no @CAPS1 askd even if you dont wont to do it last week my mom told me to cleam the living room even know it was hard I still did not it. Even know I did not want to do it was unfair	4	4	8
18700	7	Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go a friend's house. Savannah dad is a firefighter and he had to put out of fire a could not pick me up to the next afternoon. I was sad. It was the middle of @DATE2 and I haven't seen savannah in @NUM1 months. That day I learned Patience is a way of life people have to live with and this is the time I had to live with it.	7	7	14
18703	7	@CAPS1 my name is @CAPS2 ?? and this is a story about the time I was patient. Once when I was eight years old my mom said that she would take me to the fair that day. so after lunch we went to the rain I wanted to ride the biggest ride there so we had to wait in line for it ?? line was very long so I had to be patient to get on the ride. I did not want to wait in line so half of the time in line I was complaining but ??the line was not that long and l have to be patient. I am glad I was patient because the ride was?? Of fun. That day l walked that was good to be patient. I told my ?? I will never be unpatient again. That was the story?? The time l had to be patient at their??	6	8	14
18715	7	The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs of kings that said @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said @CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives!!! By: unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong	9	11	20
18748	7	Patience, having patience means you dont complain about things that take long amounts of time. You are tolerant, or understanding. Some reasons why you should @CAPS7 patience are things like .  You @CAPS7 @CAPS8 wait in a extremely long line and the whole time you are waiting you say things like,  @CAPS1, this takes @CAPS5. Or,  @CAPS1, when @CAPS3 @CAPS6 leave. @CAPS3t @CAPS6 just @CAPS9? Your @CAPS1 would be thinking,  @CAPS4 my gosh would you just stop talking? Or she would just want @CAPS8 scream. So your @CAPS1 probably wouldnt ever want @CAPS8 take you somewhere that involved waiting ever again because she knows that you are @CAPS8 impatient @CAPS8 handle it. Some reasons why maybe you wouldnt want @CAPS8 be patient or you would want @CAPS8 be inpatient could be like if you had a meeting with your teacher and if you were late then you would @CAPS7 a bad first impression.So your @CAPS1 is taking @CAPS5 talking on the phone so you keep saying,@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9,@CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9! @CAPS10 you wait very impatiently. Although, patience is basically like a kind , gentle way of waiting. Even though on the inside, your picturing yourself screaming at someone who youre waiting on. Where on the outside, you are patiently waiting. So, having patience is a good thing. Try, it sometimes just dont let your feelings on the inside tear apart what is happening on the outside.	7	9	16
18751	7	Being patient is a valve. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didnt return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1s uncles patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient.	11	12	23

18776	7	A time when someone else I knew was patient was when I was trying to have sleepover with my friend @CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their anniversery dinner. It was around @NUM1 pm when they left, and we just started digging into the deep dish @CAPS2s pizza. Halfway through dinner I got a text from my next door neighbor, ??? my best friend, asking if I wanted to have a sleepover. I replied saying that my parent are out, theyll be back in a few hours, Ill ask later. @CAPS6 finally around @NUM2 pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. She said, I dont know. And walked away. About a hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied finally! @CAPS4 I had to go pack. @CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, @CAPS5! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave! @CAPS6 I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS7 house she opened the door and let me in. I said, @CAPS8 it took @CAPS6 long. Thanks for being @CAPS6 patient!	11	12	23
18789	7	One day my brother, my mom and me were going to the doctors because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctors offices and sat in the waiting area. They called my mom and brother. So I had to stay. My mom told it will only take two minutes. Guess what she was wrong. It took her two hours to come back. So while I was patient I texted my aunt and friends. I also played some games. I actually brought my @CAPS1 with me. So I waited and waited. I was so bored I went outside for some fresh air. Then I got tired I just sat there. Finally they came out. Guess what my mom said how are you sweety, then my mum told me my brother was sick. I was so patient that we got to eat at @ORGANIZATION1. after the ??? I was patient at the clinic so then we spent @NUM1 minutes. Here so I ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? to sleep. I was ??? ??? Because I was patient its not that ??? believe ??? its actually easy. Thats a ???	10	9	19
18816	7	Last @DATE1 I went with some friends to the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 is about christan rock music. The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite christan rock band, @CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their cd's and it was amazing. The past that made me patient was the line that my friend @PERSON1 and I had to wait in to get autographs. It almost streched out the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end of it. Even though the wait was long the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front the wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice and I gave there lead singer @CAPS3 my lucky braclet. That was the time I was patient.	9	8	17
18817	7	One time there were two twin chipmunks, there names were @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 always had patience A.J not so much. One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed up there camping gear and headed farther into the woods it was around dusk when they reached were they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire, @LOCATION1 started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how there mom and dad had taught them. As l said in the first part @LOCATION1 has no patience so he kept on trying but after awile he stopped he would hit the rocks together once and it wouldnt start so @PERSON1 tried in @NUM1 minute he got it started. A.J. didnt care he got the acorns and started cookin. But every time hed only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds so he tried and tried finally he just stopped well it @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes, @LOCATION1 was really mad now so they went to bed. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning he found @LOCATION1 cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient.	8	12	20
18827	7	A couple of days ago when I was at cheer a lot of drama was going around our team, it was fifteen days befor compition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom cutine in our second formation wasnt in a diagnal line we were supposed to be and wasnt getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1(one of our coaches daughters) was yelling at the side Im on for not getting to the kickline in time even though shes the on pushing us father down so we cant get there then she started yelling at @PERSON1 saying it was all her falt so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone else for everything you arnt perfect at everything ether, and your  the ones pushing us over so we cant get to the kickline in time. @LOCATION1 didnt know what to say but she said @CAPS1 up @PERSON2! that isnt true. even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline she didnt move closer to the center she moved farther and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends, they still are friends, just not best friends.	8	8	16
18837	7	One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & I taught him how to pitch. @PERSON1 easly devoloped a nice windup and delivery but the arin angle was off. But this didnt stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said no! @CAPS2 time went on @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing @NUM1 mph fasiball at a cetcher. On days that hes unaccurate he doesnt gave he keeps trying and doesnt wine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to some seltons patience.	11	8	19
18847	7	One some day, it was about @NUM1. My mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready I dont know what we was getting ready far, but we get on the road as soon as we cloud. I fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the height. I woke up from a big @CAPS1 on the breaks and when I looked up, we were in a long line of cars, where are we?I ask six flags. @CAPS2 my brother. I could hear impatience people all around me. They were thinking screaming and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park. It seem like we were moving faster than @CAPS3 of the fast people, and we was one of the first people to get in first. That was the @CAPS3 impatience group of people Id ever seen.	10	8	18
18853	7	Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if its a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldnt believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dads dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, will you use it?	11	12	23
18865	7	One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called modern, if you dont know what that is Ill tell you. Well modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love, a spote park mony and tree stuff. I went there with my mom I told her she doesnt have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stared well I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me cheered me and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met.	5	8	13
18888	7	A time I was patient was when my mom was take me to my friends house to play foot ball. It is a long story but I will tell you anyways. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 called me over to come play football. So I asked my mom for a ride she said yes. So when we were driving my ???? she had to get after things from the grocery store. She took in hule hour in there. The she had to go some were else she took @NUM1 hours in there.then my called and said are you coming or what. Then I said yes. I was so kept my cool and waited. Then I finally got there. It not much of a story. That was the time I was patient.	8	8	16
18895	7	Everyone has to have patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say Patience is vertile. @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven oclock, he will be there by seven oclock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven oclock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and Patience.	6	7	13
18896	7	Patience @CAPS1 and my mom were sitting on the coach and we were going to go to the store to get groceries then go to school cloth shoping.  My sistr didnt really wont to go but my mom made her so she was already mad about that but we went and got food that she apparently dint like but she just being her normal! Self esteem and greedy. we are here said my mom we are at @CAPS2 to go shopping to my sister. She dosent like @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 or are like I do  mabe cause she dosent think she can fit them but anyways we do in and she dosent see anything she likes so she starts throwing a tempestan ?? my mom was so patient with her. I couldent belive it so we lost to of her name and she took @CAPS1 to my spares.	9	7	16
18899	7	Patience! Being patient can get you want and I gonna tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It @DATE1; two weeks before my birthday I asked for a male scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course I was upset I was furious. I waited a few days, but I didnt get it. I waited another week I still didnt get it. When my birthday came, (@DATE2) I finally got my matai scoot! I was so happy! Thats why people should be patient because you might get what you ask for!	8	7	15
18900	7	A time I was patient was when my grandparent and I were driving to florida. It took about one and a half days to arrive. Then it took us six hours to get to @LOCATION2. My uncle @PERSON1, his wife and his four boy went also. They had rented a house for us to stay with them. On @DATE1 which was the after we got their we went to @LOCATION1 to see my grandpas sister @PERSON2. That took us about an hour and thirty minutes because we got lost. The last time we went to florida was to see my cousin @CAPS1 get @CAPS2. No, his little sister was getting @CAPS2 , I couldnt wait to see them. The wedding was @CAPS3 I couldnt understand it.So I waited for it to get over. After the wedding we went back to my aunts house. On @DATE2 we went to the flea market and it was huge. It took us an hour to look at the whole thing. I wanted to leave at stand fifty-five but I had to by something for my mom and dad. So again I waited patiently for us to leave. On @DATE3 we left to go home. We got here around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. I was so tired I almost fell asleep on the floor. So the whole ride their and back I waited patiently.	8	8	16
18902	7	One time I were a patient was when I broke my arm. I was there for @NUM1. I was playing outside and was climbing a pole and I droped down and I put a @CAPS1 on it and it swore up. My doctor was very peaceful. And nice. In conclusion this is a time I was a patient	5	4	9
18915	7	Have you ever been patient? I have, one time me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to @CAPS1. When we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menus and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasnt frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again.	8	11	19

18925	7	Once I was at an airport in @LOCATION1. We were coming home from @LOCATION2. After we got off the plane we had to go to customs. There were only two people working for @LOCATION3 citizens. The line was very long. After half an hour we were only half way through the line. There was a lot of waiting and a lot whining but we finally made it through. Of course they all thanked us for our patience and once the passport were stamped we were on our way to the next flight.	9	8	17
18926	7	Once upon a time there was a young girl named @CAPS1 she lived with her dad and mom in a small town of @PERSON2. It was mom in a small town of @PERSON2.

18942	7	One time when I had a lot of paitenits is when I sprined my one ice skating. I was doing spins and trichs everywhere, and one I did not land. I fell on my back, but the bone I hurt was my arm, my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I fell. My arm was hurting so bad from it. So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting @NUM1 times more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to devnlop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didnt break my arm, however I was in a lot of pain waiting for the resualts. It took a lot of paients for me to just wait, and, wait, and wait for those x-rays,	10	10	20
18944	7	One time I was patient. I dont want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun.	4	8	12
18977	7	On @DATE1 I was with my dad at @NUM1 am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tried & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many night I heard leaves cracking & I thought is it really true. On my first day I would shoot one I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quick & he ran away. On another day we came out I saw another dies but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & @CAPS1 I aimed & fired! Well thats what I thought but no it was jamed and @CAPS1 I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walky-talky, & asked what are you doing. @CAPS1 I said I see a doe, @CAPS1 he said then shoot it, & it stood there @CAPS1 I shot again & then it ran away, I missed I said all that patience for nothing.	10	9	19
18982	7	It takes a lot of patients especially when you are travelling for @NUM1 hours strait. When I was @NUM2 we went to @LOCATION3 for a half a year. Me my mom and my dad left at @NUM3 am for the airport. We waited there for a long time. When we finally got on the plane we took the hour long flight to @LOCATION4. Ten a @NUM4 hour flight to los @LOCATION1. We waited in those airports for a long time. Then came the @NUM5 hour flights to @LOCATION2. That was the longest flight Ive ever been on. The plane was a huge double deck @NUM6 jet. Then we took the @NUM7 hour flight to hawk bay. It was a really long trip. It took a ton of patients. Well we went there because my dad was making a golf coarse. That takes a lot of patients too but, its a lot more fun. That was the most patient Ive ever had to be.	8	11	19

19005	7	My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill its over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesnt rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave.	10	6	16
19011	7	This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. This happens every year Im pretty sure every one knows about it. It is call birthday. Every year I have to wait for @NUM1 days for my birthday to come. It takes a while, but I know I have to be patient. Being patient is hard work but usually pays off. Another way that  I have to be patient is waiting for the @CAPS1 tests to get over . But I always remember it has to end sometime. So I have to sit there do the work and be patient.	8	6	14
19030	7	One time when I had to be patient was when, i had to babysit. My family friend has a one year old @CAPS1 ,And I have a six year old brother .I had to babysit both of them because my mom and her boy friend were going  to have a double date with our family friends . Things were great until they left .My brother was in preschool at the time @CAPS2 they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do and I had to help him. @CAPS2 I thought ok this will be easy, @CAPS2 i had him read the book and my mom told me that he knows the words @CAPS2 i wont have to sound out every single one, I had  to he wouldnt  do the work and the baby wouldnt quit crying and the dog wouldnt stop barking (he hate when babys cry) and the house was crazy! @CAPS2 i started to panic. What was I supposed to do? And I didnt what to ruin my mom plans and i definetly wanted to prove her wrong. @CAPS2 i calmed down and remembered what one of our friends said he told me to be patient. @CAPS2 i let the dog outside and picked up the baby and headed back to the table where my brother was playing. First  i read the book aloud it got both of their attention .then i  told  andi made a game out of doing the work and it was all good .Then  @CAPS4  time came @CAPS2 i made some food that we all liked and set the baby in his high chair with  his food and  gave my brother his plate i turned around and he  trowed  his plate at me  and food was everywhere! I got mad and told myself be patient, i cleaned up the mess and feed the kids and put in a movie and they all feel a sleep! I quietly, cleand up the house and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised i did it. Patence is a big part in life if you loose your temper it just makes things worse.	10	11	21
19031	7	One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said @CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later? I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didnt seem like much. When we got into the store thats when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said @CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients? Ill try. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said @CAPS4 you for your patients. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said Do you see what happens if you be patient? I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient.	10	11	21
19033	7	Patience is probalbly  one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient, most people will probalbly like you more, for example, if you are in line for something at school, and you were patient, you will probalbly get a @CAPS1 you from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park rides line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldnt want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed. This is why I think patience is important.	6	4	10
19041	7	One time that I was patient was whe I was @NUM1 years old when I coght my @NUM2 fish. Me and my dad went fishing on my uncles bout my dad stoped the bout where we wher going to fish my dad help me put on my life jacet and then he bated my pocil.

That was a time where I had to be patient.	8	8	16
19054	7	I was patient when I was at my friends house in the winter shoveling a sleding slot so we can but water on it to make ice. When we where shoveling it was hard become we had to got through lots of snow just  to got to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not patient gye when. We do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patients was because it was getting dark and I has to go soon. But before I became unpatient we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice but that didnt bother me at all. Thats how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But I couldnt  or we couldnt go on it that night because it was to late. I thats my story about  patientce  The @CAPS1	9	12	21
19064	7	My mom have patence with me and my brother with all the fighting going  on people getting killed around here she dont like us going place with that going on  we come home late	4	3	7
19072	7	@CAPS1 I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer. A front-full is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldnt land it. My gymnastics coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he sees me he says my baby! and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesnt. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. @CAPS1 I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic try again, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didnt stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1.	10	12	22
19080	7	Well Im patient and Im in the middle patience is all about waiting or juss sitting with someon you dont like. One time when I was little I was not very patient. My mom wants say had on a couple of seconds and I would say @NUM1. But when I got older I was more patient. Like, I was patient with teachers and peers and parents but there are times that I still have a unpatient side, I will try not to get unpatient but sometimes it juss happens. I love having someone to talk to but some times I cant talk to them because Im unpatient. My friends are really good about it first though some time they dont my mom is really patient but my dad is not so maybe get it from him I dont really talk to my dad though although Im unpatient Im really out going and funny. I have a lot of friends because Im outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because Im outgoing and that has a blown side. I love talking and having fun maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment. In conclusion I need more patience but patiuence is a thing I can defiatly work on.	5	5	10
19083	7	@CAPS1 were gonna be late! yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily. @CAPS1 were gonna be late! yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily.You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parmls, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was estaric. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to @PERSON1s parents before we left, so @PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to ???? @PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3? I asked safely, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seamed to grow twice their size. @CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4!  Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play! @PERSON1 yelled??? . Though she made it sound like ??? I smilled and we began tro play. She would guess??? I would let her win. ??? was so ??? and I think I made her more patoient to leave by helping her play a game.Finally my parents walked outside and we began our skitrip. Patience had payed off.	12	8	20
19100	7	One day in the beginning of foll, @PERSON1 was watching @CAPS1.V. As she was watching, a commercial comes on and says that the final movie, of a very popular series, is coming to theaters tomorrow night. The next day of school, everyone was excited. They all couldn@CAPS1 wait to see the movie that night. Finally the time come to go get the tickets. When @PERSON1 got there, a huge line was already formed. @PERSON1  was waiting, then she realized her best friend, @PERSON2, was in front of her. Then the rich popular girl showed up her lime. Her name was @CAPS2. She walked up to the ticket booth and cut everyone in line. She tried to pay extra money for a better seat and because she cut people in line. The ticket seller said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made @CAPS2 mad, and because she didn@CAPS1 get in line when she got there, more people got in line. But all that time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were talking. Since they were patient, time flew by and the next thing they knew they were buying tickets. But @CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets cause she was not patient.	12	9	21
19119	7	On @DATE1 me and my two friends were all laughing out but then I had rememberd that in @NUM1 min I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside and my friends were being so patient. They didnt leave me and so I hurried as fast as I could so I didnt keep them waiting. After I got done we went back up to the park and swang on the swing. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home. That was my @DATE1. It was a fun one.	8	6	14
19122	7	One time i was pacent  it was the time I wanted a I-pod tuch. My grandma was bidding on a I-pod tuch. It took a long  time to get it but we won. It took a long time for them to ship it but we got it. In the end it all paid off.	0	5	5
19125	7	A time when I was patient is last year when my dad took me hunting. It all began when we woke up at @NUM1 in the morning got dressed and left to go get in are deer blind. As soon as we got there we heard a lot of gun shots. From shot guns, rifles and even black powder. We waited all day until it was dark again then we packed up and we left. Me and my dad didnt see anything that whole day. That is a story about how I am patient.	8	9	17
19126	7	"One day I was going hunting and I was patiently waiting for my dad to get his clothes on. When he finally did we headed out to the woods. After that we got in a blind, as we patiently waited for fiftyen minutes. Just then a deer came in. It was a perfect doe. Finally the deer gets in front of the blind about @NUM1 or @CAPS1 and my dad quietly says ""wait for it to turn broadside."" @CAPS1 I waited until it turn and shoot the doe. Finally we get out and find my arrow but never found the deer and I had to have patient for next years hunt."	8	8	16
19129	7	@CAPS1 brother was patient ones, @CAPS1 brother was patient by understanding a tolerant. He understand a toleran by sinting down waiting. He was waiting in the doctor to get steches. I was being patient by wainging with him. We always be patient when we have to wait for something, another time I was being patient is when I always get @CAPS1 hair cut or hair line. I had to wait in a long ling to get @CAPS1 hair cut. That is some of the times I had to be patient.	3	5	8
19130	7	One day I had a doctors appointment and I had to check- in at the desk and after I did that I had to sit and be patient till the doctors called me back to get my check up done  and I to wait till the real doctor came to see how I was feeling and to see if I was eating good to and then I had to go to the check out desk to see what was my next check up was and then I had to get my pills refilled and then I went home.	6	7	13

When we were there my dad shot a doe @TIME1 @NUM1 in the merking. He short another doe @TIME1 about @NUM2 in the @TIME2, so we left with two big does in the back of my dads truck. That was a time that I was very patient.	8	8	16

When we  ask for things over and over again she doesn`t get angry and out bust she just says no or yes you @MONTH1 with a smile or when she comes home from a long day at work. She never complains she just keeps a smile on her face and finishes the rest of the adventures day. When she wakes up in the morning to take us to school she has a bright smile on her face and she never complains. My mom is very patient women and a great teacher and leader. I apreciates everything she does for me, my brother, and dad.	5	6	11
19183	7	Im writing a story about patience. Patience in can say like Im waiting for you to get done with whatever your doing. Something like the o, say @CAPS1 been waiting for the kids to be quite. And they cant so even though shes getting mad, she still being patient with us instead of saying get out my class giving us chance after chance. Because she want us to be good and stay in class.	6	6	12
19194	7	When I was patient, we were onone way to @CAPS1 point: with @LOCATION1 her mom and dad and her brother and I. We were driving to go there. It took us @NUM1 hours to get there. @LOCATION1 and I were very patient we wated and waited to get there we were soo exited. When we got there, we all waited in line to ride a hole bunch of rollercoaster. We all waited in line about @NUM2 hours for every ride it was extra buisy that day. @LOCATION1 and I wanted to ride the tallest rollercoaster. It was called the @CAPS2 the @CAPS2 was @NUM1 @NUM4 it was the tallest rollercoster. I had ever been on and all the other people that came too. To get on that ride it was a @NUM5 hour wait it was exosting and we had to be very patient. But when we got to the front it was worth the wait!	9	7	16
19199	7	It was a nice warm sunny @DATE1 day!!! We decided we could go pick up every one from my dads house and go to the genesee county farm. We got to my dads house and pick up my step brother, step sister, real brother, step mom, and my dad. We start heading to the genesee county farm. We started walking around waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it was going to rain that would be a waist of money. We walk up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wrist bands if it starts raining. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile the barn starts flooding. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finaly it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying on the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate toco bell and burger tong.	8	9	17
19203	7	Being patient is very difaclut. I was a the store with my mom, and of course @CAPS1 was taching forever. come on mom lets go do we really need this stuff @CAPS1 just continued shoping. Grrr I was so angry. I almost thought about throughing a fit. Finally, we were in line. As we got into the car my mom looked at me and said give me your phone. @CAPS2 why? The way you ackted in that store was horibal now I no I will alway be patient with my mom.	7	7	14
19256	7	One time when I was patient was when I was fishing. We where fishing on a cold night and no fish where bighting,. I was just @CAPS1 ther being patient caling sun flower  seeds. My dad was getting mad and I was still @CAPS1 listning  to the backeasard  celtcs  games.  We where only catching little fish that night nuthing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didnt have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample.	8	8	16
19287	7	Patient I was patient when I was in @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 appointment to wait in the waiting room. My some teacher says wait a minit because teachers are talking to someone else. When I have any @CAPS3 teacher says don't open it so I always been patient. When someone tells me to wait. I also be patient when I'm waiting for the buses, airplanes, trains to come. I be patient when I'm bored to wait sometimes. That's how I've been patient.	6	8	14
19289	7	I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patient. I had to use patients when I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box @NUM1. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. Alls I did was sit in a chair and watch him. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again. So then we had to take the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patients because if I didnt I would have been really bored. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it. I t took @CAPS1 @CAPS4 almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patients so the system could be delivered. Patients is a very needy thing in life. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have patients.	10	8	18

19333	7	One time I was patient is when I went to get my hair cut and she told me to come at @TIME1. But when I got there at @TIME1, she had like @NUM1 people in front of me but I didn't care because I didn't have to do nothing after. So I was just going to sit there and be patient and I had my best friend with me so I wasn't bored and we was just sitting there talking and texting our boyfriends. So then the lady that was bout to cut my hair came to me and said I am so sorry, but I told you the wrong time and I said oh it's ok l can wait. And when she got done with they hair the ladies came to me and said they was sorry. So then she had @NUM2 person left and by the time she get done be getting on like @NUM3 - @NUM4. And that was the time I was being patient.	8	8	16
19336	7	A time when I was patient well it didnt just happened once it happends all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping she brings all the females in my family my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car or stay at home. I will talk about when go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just dont go to one mall and stop they go to at least two mall three max. They go to a lot of strip malls too for exsample simply fashion and things like rainbow. They are going to a hundred place for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and im getting hungry and tired but, I dont complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females clothing stores like victoria @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. Then shop for jewlery make up perfume and every woman item known to the world. Plus I get lost because they leave me. In conclusion I am very patient for my mother no matter what.	9	7	16
19360	7	I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teachers or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teachers demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, Id see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. Thats not the only time but, its the most longest time I was patient with some one.	10	8	18
19375	7	One day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1. We were getting there by this big fast boat called the jet exspress. So we had to wait in this big line. The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late. I shold of known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing. We were the first people in line so that was a go thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun.	9	8	17
19376	7	When my friend was getting his meds I waited until he got ready, I was seating to wait for him. I was getting my phone down loud @PERSON2 ping pong and uplift. I was looking for @PERSON1 and I was waiting for him to be done.	5	4	9

We waited @NUM2 minutes plus the time for every to get out.	6	7	13

He turned to look at @PERSON1, held his gaze, then looked back at ceiling. @CAPS2 wasnt at school that day either. He went skiing up at his family cottage. I wasnt patient when I was in the air. I got crushed and none of it would have happened if I had waited.	9	12	21

19520	7	A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well I get out of school at @TIME1 my dad gets at @TIME2So,if  I wanted his  help , I would have to wait myself  but I didnt understand it. Even with homework that needed help on back in my backpack until my dad got home I wished the homework that didnt need help on. After my homework   that which I did all my @CAPS1, then it was time to eat, as I ate my dinner. By that time I was done waiting my dad me, more and really to help we as my dinner. It was last to go to wait over my dad to help understand it so much more.	9	9	18
19522	7	On @DATE1 my friend @CAPS1 and I climbed on the bus headed for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together till @NUM1 am. We had been riding all diffrent rides all day and we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front said wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours, but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started a @NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnixous screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said @CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6 all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did.	12	10	22
19528	7	A time when someone was patient was when a guy named @PERSON2 was driving and a little girl named @PERSON1 was walking on the side walk and it was a red light. She yelled out loud go old man  the old man went and she flowed him to the store and she asked what was that and @PERSON2 sales that was nothing .No you tried  to hit me no you were rushing  me so I went. @PERSON1 saies to @PERSON2 I was looseing or patience .@PERSON2 tell her well learn how to control the in.	7	6	13
19534	7	One time me and my family were at @CAPS1 point over the @DATE1. My sister really wanted to go on all of the small kiddie rides with me but I didnt feel like it. I wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It looked really cool so my dad and I ran over to the entrance, but when we got their the wait time on the board said one hour and fortyfive minutes. I really wanted to go on this ride but really wasnt worth standing in that line. So when the line started moving and we were half way their the signs said @NUM1 minutes. I told my dad maybe we should do this another day. But my dad said that well be trough soon and he told me for just watch the people on it go by and not talk. We moved up only a little and the time was at @NUM1 minutes, so my dad said maybe we should do this another day and then we left the line to find my mom and sister.	9	9	18
19542	7	Not long ago I went to the pumpkin patch with my mom, sister, grandma, aunt, uncle my @NUM1 year old niece and baby cusin. When we where done, we went to a restaurant to eat. After @NUM2 minutes of waiting for the waitress, she comes over just to tell us she will be with us @CAPS1. So we wait for half an hour just to put our drink orders in. When we finally got to order our food it took them an hour to bring it.	7	8	15
20716	8	 A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON2 who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure. I started &lt;@CAPS5 knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS1 sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom&gt;. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS5 @CAPS5&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.             FIN	18	16	34
20717	8	" Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @CAPS2. Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have.  Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was my team name, I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team, I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team.  As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly and I wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ""ready or not here we come"". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt.  As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by I saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the @CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field they all grew a smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS2. I have had great memories with the @CAPS2, but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships; therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people."	21	26	46
20727	8	" Laugher Laughter is to express delight, fun, or a object of a joke. Laughter is something we all do, its a large benefit in our life and it happend on a everyday scedual. Without laughter we couldn't express our happy, out going side, we would have no particullar feeling in life except for frowning, which is a proven fact to cose more wrinkles beacuse of how many more muscles it uses.  For me laughter is a all day thing, @CAPS1 show, my friends, family and, horses are my number one reason for my frown to be tured up side down. You @MONTH1 think horses cant smile, or talk but @CAPS2 do have their own ways of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @CAPS2 are all smart, but @CAPS2 can be clutsy or goofy at times. Mostly @CAPS2 all just make you laugh and giggle like your own little brothers or sisters.  There is this one time that I will always have locked away in the back of my mind. It took place on a @DATE1 mid-day at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses saddled, ready to go. Both us and our horses felt the energy rush when we saw the waves pouning at the shore with the salty smell in our noses.  Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind wistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses heads were equaly pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced arounds like yearlings again, @CAPS2 would walk tell into the water tell it was drenching us both then soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'ed swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore.   After about five hours of adventuring caves, sand dunes and starfish we were all worn out, then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"". Driving home I knew this was a perfuct day because of the laughter, and of all the times I just laughed for the injoyment, also my face did hurt a little from smiling so much."	16	15	31
20735	8	 one time when i was skateboarding with my friend i got relay mad and i wanted to stop skating. His mom tried to convince me to keep skateboarding.Laughed and seed i will never be good enough to skate and she seed that i have improved than some of the people that she knows.That made me feel better than before and then i started skate boarding every day from then. When i think about that day i still laugh.skating can be fun in many ways.People can skate for fun and for compaction.There are different ways of skating people have there ways of skating.There are many different kinds of skateboards the people who skate them ride them different. Some of the people that ride skateboards i laugh at because the way they skate.   	10	10	20
20800	8	" This true story might sound some what cheesy, but its true and in my opinion its a love story. I will be substituting the real names with others names though. On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log on @CAPS1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to @PERSON2. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 had accepted @PERSON1's request that's when @PERSON1 remembered about the request. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, @CAPS9 before the had no clue who the other one was. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after along chat, @CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of @CAPS1-book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knew that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @NUM1 and also have friends in common. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked talking to @PERSON2 a lot. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean ""a lot"", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked that because it always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, @PERSON2 didn't mind, he @CAPS4 liked @PERSON1. He had a @CAPS4 big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12... he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said... ""@CAPS3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend"".  ""@CAPS4 you would?"" @CAPS5 @PERSON2.  ""@CAPS3 why wouldn't I? replied @PERSON1. ""@CAPS6 I thought that you wouldn't @CAPS9 you recently got out of a relationship"" @PERSON2 answered. Days had past they were doing perfectly until... @PERSON1 starting to receive texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect @PERSON1's relationship with @PERSON2.But the bad thing was that @PERSON1 was still in love with @PERSON3. @PERSON2 knew that for one. But that didn't stop @PERSON2 from fighting to get @LOCATION1's @CAPS7. @PERSON1 is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS12 one night while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 were talking on the phone, @PERSON2 decided to ask @PERSON1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything.""@CAPS9 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 have a @CAPS4 good communication when laughing is involved, @PERSON1 changed the subject and @CAPS5 @PERSON2 if he was willing on doing her a favor. Of course @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3"". The favor that @PERSON1 had @CAPS5 @PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed. ""@CAPS12 can you do me that favor? @PERSON1 @CAPS5. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it @CAPS12 much better. @CAPS3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting @NUM2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. @CAPS6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships.

20804	8	Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!	20	20	40
20819	8	 LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.  	15	15	30
20825	8	 In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for what ever reason it @MONTH1 be. those are the @NUM3 thing i think you need to have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i will never be able to lose it no matter how hard i try to i now she will always be by my side.	15	18	33
20832	8	" Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @CAPS7 fall @CAPS3 their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how @CAPS7 fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life that their isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and @CAPS7 always make me laugh. Their isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1 and sat down @CAPS3 a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3."" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS3, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS3 the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION2"", with two guys wearing black @CAPS3 each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS8""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS9""! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness."	20	18	36
20841	8	" As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we cant live without it. Its one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times, and the joy of life. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", well there right! You can think anything you want to, but i want you to know that i have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy i have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION2 inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably to nice for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice we go ahead and swim in the pool, even know we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because in was way to cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell there just sitting there pretending to mind there own business, and i know for a fact that's not why. We talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and i hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME1 and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say good bye for ever. Me and @PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had know idea that @PERSON3 gave my number to @PERSON1, the guy i kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later i get a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around"". So i amused that it was him, and i got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for the @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like i could con-core everything that came my way.  About forty five minutes past, still gazing into each others eyes, feeling like it as only been a second. His friend @PERSON2 sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom. They bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have i experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all i understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS1 and i live in @LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day i will meet him again. Maybe someday i would be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME1, and just maybe, will i fall in love with him. All those maybe's have came true, because i fallowed what was right and i waited. Now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life."	17	16	33
20853	8	"DAIRY @CAPS1 boyfriend and I spend a lot of time hanging out together,@CAPS2 two days ago @PERSON3 and I had just gotten into an argument . his mom had just finished making food.he wanted me to try it and see if i liked it. but before I ate any @CAPS3 him if he would eat some of it with me.""maybe just a little bit""he had said getting up to grab a fork.Ithought he was going to eat it with me but it turned out that he just sat next to me talking to @PERSON2 @CAPS2 the fight he had just been in. I really didn't mind the fact that he wasn't eating with me. Icontinued eating, I separated the food by colors to make a face on my plate. it turned out looking pretty great, he looks over and says""whats that supposed to be?"" with a smirk on his face""its a face!... see the carrots are the nose the shrimp are the eyes the greens and , noodles form the mouth and hair"" I look up with a smile ""wanna take a picture of my face on the plate ?"" I say ""nope""he answers ""@CAPS4"" I answer backI mix up all the things again and continue eating my food when I'm done I get up , put the plate in the sink go back to the table and sit down. @PERSON3 gets up goes outside brings more wood for the fire place and starts lighting it. I go up ask him if hes mad he says yes now I'm sad. I say I'm sorry we talked it over and it turned out that he was mad because I didn't let him take a picture of my food. after five minutes were happy again @PERSON1 suggests that we go to @CAPS5 we all agreed. when we got their we all ordered our food and waited.""lets to the wrestling mat!?""we all said at the exact time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 stayed waiting for the order while @PERSON3 and I when to go play in the little kid toys. we were fighting our way in to the wrestling mat when we noticed that all the little kids were staring at us like they had never see older kids play . we continued our little game of kicking, punching, slapping and scratching each other. i decided that i need a time out so I sat up and took long breaths.out oh the onwear I hear this weird noise I look over and asked him if he had farted he looked at me with a cheese smile and after five second he repiles yes. and continued farting but the room seemed quiet too quite we looked a round to see that all the littlte biys and girls heard him too! their were to little girls standing at the entrance a little boy a few feet away from @PERSON3 and two other little kids by the slide.I guess they were shocked i started laughing to tears, ran out of the play room to go tell @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 what had just happen they too thought that it was hilarious."	15	17	32
20861	8	"                     Laughter Laughter has always played a significant role in the relationships of @CAPS2 life. Being able to laugh with someone creates a bond with that person.Through laughter, I was able to become friends with a person that I can call to this day @CAPS2 best friend. I met the person that would later on become @CAPS2 best friend through one of @CAPS2 friends. A few friends of mine and I were hanging out and @CAPS2 friend, @PERSON1, said, "" @CAPS1 know @PERSON2, @CAPS1 should talk to a good friend of mine.""I didn'@CAPS4 oppose to the idea because from what @PERSON1 told me about her, it seemed like it would be very easy for me to get along with her. About ten minutes later, I looked down at @CAPS2 cell phone and noticed that I had a text message from a number that I did not know. I asked who the person was and waited for a response. Two minutes pass by and I get a message that says, ""@CAPS2 name is @ORGANIZATION2. I am the girl the curly-headed kid sitting next to @CAPS1 told @CAPS1 about."" Once I read this I started just about busted up into a fit of laughter. Never would I have thought a girl I had never spoken to would be brave enough,or sarcastic enough, to say something like that as the first thing they would say to me. For the next few hours, we kept exchanging sarcastic remarks and jokes and the laughs just kept on coming. @ORGANIZATION2 is the type of person that can make anyone laugh. This is what I love about her; @CAPS3 possesses a talent of making anyone laugh no matter where they are, what kind of mood they are in, or what they are doing. We have walked around for hours and we have spent a majority of that time having to stop and catch our breath because we had been laughing so hard. Our ability to laugh with each other has helped us through difficult times in our lives. @ORGANIZATION2's mom passed away a few years ago and this sent her into a depressive state. @CAPS3 rarely felt any happiness until we would talk. Our ability to start laughing at one another helped her throughout this time. I recently received a @CAPS4.B.I. or @ORGANIZATION1. I felt numb to the world. Nothing felt the way that it once felt. Luckily for me, @ORGANIZATION2 was able to come in and do what I had done for her; @CAPS3 was able to make me laugh and feel normal again. Having the ability to laugh with @ORGANIZATION2 has definitely made our friendship stronger than it would have been had we not been able to laugh together. Being able to laugh doesn'@CAPS4 just effect that one moment in time, nor does it just impact one person. Having laughter means so much more than that. Being able to laugh creates bonds that are simply not possible without laughter. I have felt what laughter can do to a relationship and I can say that it most definitely feels good."	19	20	40
20862	8	" ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 society today loves laughter. From comical shows to hilarious friends, people have fun convulsing with glee. Not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. Everyone that texts @MONTH1 use ""@CAPS3"" or ""haha"" to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having, ""a smile that burst.""  I couldn't wait. I was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. Because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping @CAPS4. Jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. After the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. Jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  We headed into the crisp air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. The walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  When we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. Eventually, @CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. At last, the astonishing sunrise happened. It was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. I peered over the edge and saw a little path. With a bunch of convincing, I got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  The first part of the path was simple. As we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. A couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So on we went. ""@CAPS6 no!"" @CAPS7 yelled. We turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. She had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. Suddenly, @PERSON1 tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @PERSON2 forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. While flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if I didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. While she was in the bush, she grabbed @PERSON2's shoe. The hard part was getting @PERSON1 out.  The first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. Finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. @PERSON1 was super embarrassed. After all of that, we headed down the hill. We still had giggles while trotting down the trail. As we went, we saw animal tracks. We then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. A couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. With out it, we could have been very grumpy. Also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important. When writing this paper to the @ORGANIZATION1's in @LOCATION1, I told my friends about the adventure we went on and the predicament we got ourselves into. They laughed hysterically, since they knew the girls. Laugh often to be happy."	20	25	45
20869	8	"                                        A day with the family  One day my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and i had gone out to eat at @ORGANIZATION2 for breakfast. They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS2 much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS1 where my cousin @PERSON1 farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS2 many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS2 hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS2 bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom ""I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have"".  Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us @CAPS2 we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS2 we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out ""wicked witch of the west""! He frowns at me and says, ""@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out."" @CAPS2 i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS2 confused. My cousins shouts out ""poop""! My brother yells ""@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop""! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS2 dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME1.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good. "	20	16	36
20877	8	" I have had many great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground. @CAPS1 campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME1. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food.  The next @TIME2 on the way out we saw a sign that read ""caution racoon problem."" @CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1. Once in @LOCATION1 we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1. While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny. A young blond woman came out to help us and she wasn't the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly ""dumb blonde"", while the woman was standing right there. She didnt say a word and my gandpa drove off with me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened. The next @TIME1 we stayed at a diiferent campground with no racoons. Still the @TIME1 was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmellows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmellow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmellow before he even got one that he could eat. And everytime he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt. The best part was theat my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent that @TIME1 we were so tired everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2. Thats when everything went silent and we couldnt last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always keep me laughing and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with. Keep laughing and have a fun in all you do."	20	20	40
20881	8	"Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends @PERSON2 I decided @CAPS5 would be fun to go out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods @PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 hide @PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that @CAPS5 was pouring down rain @PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 after we had our little meeting @PERSON2 got everything situated @PERSON2 dealt with, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 went of @PERSON2 hid while me @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @PERSON2 count. After we counted to about @NUM2 we hear screaming @PERSON2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON2 maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. I was curious @CAPS3 I cracked the car door open @CAPS3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 rite behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked as if @CAPS4 was about to cry @PERSON2 @PERSON2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS4 kept slipping @PERSON2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS4 finally made @CAPS5 back @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON2 screaming from, @CAPS3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION1 jumps out in front of me @PERSON2 says ""right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!"" @CAPS3 I walked over to where @CAPS4 pointed @PERSON2 looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON2 grabs me from the back @PERSON2 screams. I turn around @PERSON2 look at her thinking ""what the heck is wrong with you people!"". @CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON2 ask her ""whats wrong"" @CAPS4 asks me, ""why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!"" @CAPS5 was dark @PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON2 as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON2 by the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON2 yells ""@CAPS6! Its moving, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's moving @CAPS7!"" @CAPS3 as I approach the girls @PERSON2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 points @CAPS5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS5 to move again @CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @CAPS5 with the flash light @PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 ask her ""@CAPS3 @PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?"" @CAPS4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, ""take a look at @CAPS5 for yourself"" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 saw @CAPS5.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that @CAPS4 say @CAPS5 I told @PERSON2 what @CAPS5 was @PERSON1 her @PERSON2 I started cracking up laughing about @PERSON1 @PERSON2 her ""hideous monster"". Once I got my laughs out on @PERSON2, we all went back to the car where @PERSON3 was waiting @PERSON2 we left. Ever since that night @PERSON2, @PERSON2 @PERSON2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Every time we think about @CAPS5 we all start laughing @PERSON2 making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag."	16	12	28
20919	8	" Laughter is a sign of good relationships. To some people it's a sign of personality, sign of love and also a sign showing someone that you care.  To me laughter is what makes people so unique. Everybody has a different kind of laugh. For example, when you are a baby @CAPS2 laugh is high pitched. The older you get the lower @CAPS2 laugh becomes, ""like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1"". If it was not for his laugh would not be who he is. When I was a child I remember trying to laugh like just like @ORGANIZATION1 did. I would be walking around the house trying to get my laugh really @CAPS1. My family though it was the best thing ever. They would ask me to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 so they can get a laugh also.  Now today my laugh is what I wanted it to be, ""@CAPS1"". It is hard for me to laugh quietly now. I have had some people tell me things like; ""@CAPS2 laugh is what I will remember you by"" or ""@CAPS2 laugh is really something else"". I love my laugh because it is part of who I am. With out laughter you, me, or anybody else wont be they are now. Laughter is one way to show emotion. So go ahead and try different kinds of laughs. No matter what you can not change the one you were meant to have."	15	19	34
20948	8	" During the @CAPS1 break my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""@CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" @PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON4. @CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME1 when my @CAPS5 was still home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @PERSON2 and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in @LOCATION4. Just being in @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to be. Espicially when I'm with my friends and family."	19	20	40
20987	8	  While you being to make any kinda of relationship with anyone, you are usually going to start off making jokes and being silly. Whether your trying to be flirty with them, or just be the funny one and make a good, first impression. Usually all of these things lead to someone laughing; even if they really didn't have a reason to. Anyone who is shy around new people, will most likely laugh about anything they say. If it's someone you already knew, you could always be giggling about something. There are different types of relationships you build with different people and laughter is almost always the number one way to keep it together.   When you have been in a strong friendship with someone, you are already very close with each other. The laughing, crying, and fighting you do with that person, will make the relationship stronger. There are times that you spend with another individual that will makes steps towards sticking together. From my experiences, i will become somebodies close friend for quite sometime; then we will get into an argument and no longer be friends. Although we fought and wished to not talk, we became good friends again because of all the time we had spent laughing together. Being sad all the time, with no one else to laugh with, made us realize how much we missed each other. Even though meeting someone new was simple; it didn't last as long as the friendship i had with the other person.  Truly, when you meet someone for the first time, whether it's a boy or a girl, you will laugh and make jokes almost the whole time. That might even be how it will stay. Once you have known a person for so long, you can tell what type of relationship you will have with them. The connection you make with them is simple;you could get along, or you could always argue. No matter what relationship you make with an acquaintance, will most likely be the same all the time. When you are not as close with another person, you tend to not care about the friendship as often. You wont be as emotional, although your experiences you have with them could always lead to laughing. The time you spend with anyone should always be full of fun and laughter.      Another form of laughter could be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend. in my opinion, you will make a special connection with your other half. When two people have chosen to be together, they're choosing to spend their time getting to know each other on a different level. The fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love the you would have with a best friend. Couples should be enjoying their time together laughing, and making each other happy. Making each other laugh will allow them to be closer in friendship; becoming comfortable with one another. they will gain more confidence and ability, just by sharing the times laughing together.   The laughter you laugh with anyone, will build any type of relationship. Usually the first impression will identify the connection you have with that individual. There are always ways that you will act with one person and not the other. The three different types of friendship that are most common are; acquaintances, boy friend/girl friend, and close friends. All of the friends you make, people you meet, will involve a lot of laughter.	20	15	35
20993	8	 Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load lightens, @PERSON1 I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in myself is more evident sometimes than others, such as if before the miracle of laughter I was feeling overworked, worn out, or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @PERSON1 I am grateful that my days are filled with great friends @PERSON1 funny memories.  One of the things that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be able to make each other laugh. I have had multiple times with my two best friends, @PERSON1, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave feeling happy, with a smile on my face, with many good stories to tell. One of these occasions was @PERSON1's birthday party the @DATE1 before last.  @PERSON1 wanted a small party with just the people closest to her there, so @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I were the only ones invited. We live a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much to do in the area of parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to @CAPS1, just half an hour away. It was a blistering @DATE1 day @PERSON1 we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON1 started her party off with a float on the meandering @CAPS2 river. That's when the laughing began. Three twelve year old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed @CAPS3, what could be so funny? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together. They thought it was hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river weed, or pond weed, or any type of water weed for that matter ) @PERSON1 that I would yelp or full out scream every time that some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @PERSON1 just couldn't hold on to her sandals, @PERSON1 would end up making wild dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way @PERSON1, the @CAPS4 that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. @PERSON1, naturally, we pushed her in numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, @PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friends @PERSON1 get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down @PERSON1 can be myself. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, @PERSON1 still have fun.  Our laughter can even change how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon of music @PERSON1 food. We all got enormous ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, @PERSON1 were playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the @CAPS3 the ball flies over @PERSON1 knocks all the ice cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysterics. Even through my disappointment I started cracking up as well, @PERSON1 then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, @PERSON1 I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax @PERSON1 let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together is often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure fire way to get them back on their feet @PERSON1 smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, lets me abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, @PERSON1 I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together.	20	25	45
21004	8	"Laughter can sometimes be something that everyone shares together, sometimes it's used only for few as it's aimed against one another. But hopefully most of the time it's something that we all can share. Laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another. Someone could be a complete stranger to one another and then just by a simple joke, laughter could make them look like they've been friends for years. Now laughing isn't the only thing that helps people become acquainted with one another, they can share similar hobbies or likes and dislikes, but most of the time laughter is something that everyone needs in a relationship. I remember when I fisrt met my friend @PERSON1, he wasn't to outgoing, but through making jokes he seemed more comfortable in talking with others. Me and him would often talk about @CAPS1 our daily lifes where to much to handle, but instead of making jokes about it, we decided to laugh about @CAPS1 we were complaining when our lifes we easy compared to others. Some people have to work @NUM1 jobs to support a family and we're over here complaining about @CAPS1 we have to wake up and go to school, we laughed at @CAPS1 pathetic we sounded. A couple of days later we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do when we older and out of high school. @PERSON1 said he wants to be a taekwando instuctor and that he's already got a small job at one, I said ""@CAPS1 did you get the job?"", he replied ""I kicked a kid in the face pretty hard when my instuctor was watching"". We both laughed really hard, and just by that laugh we became even more of friends, cause it's through laughter that we can become civilized."	14	15	29
21053	8	"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE1, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE2 time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was sweet, @CAPS2 I though, until one @DATE2 day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" @CAPS2 me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS2 as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughing has helped me a lot in life because it brings me up when I am feeling down."	13	20	30
21055	8	" Laughter is a huge part oh building friendships, relationships, and partnerships. Laughing is the first thing you learn to do you are born knowing how to laugh its the only thing that you are born to know how to do. Laughter for me is what starts a friendship if I can make someone laugh we are already closer then when we first said ""@CAPS1"". As an example when I started working at the daycare i am at now when I got the other teachers to laugh you can just tell its there way of excepting you as part of there crew.  On the first day of work I walked in the the daycare nervous they sent me to the preschool classroom. I am pretty sure my boss could tell I was nervous and it made me laugh. It made me feel welcome to be there and like we could be friends. The children in that class room made me laugh the things they did. well working with children you find out if you can make them laugh or if you laugh at there jokes they are more inclined to trust you and with that you can make them feel comfortable around you. Having someones trust is sometimes hard to get but if you get it from the very beginning its easy to keep but also very easy to lose. When someone is down in the dumps making them simply laugh can make everything better laughter is like medicine in makes you feel better when nothing else can. Its safe to say making people laugh comes natural to I am just good at it and jokes come easily. When you laugh it makes everything better. Laughing is actually health and is a form of excursive.  When I am at work and kids laugh it makes me feel better even if I am having the worst day ever. When I am around people that are happy it makes me feel alot better about myself. Its even better when its babies that laugh becasuse they are so cute when they do it."	15	20	35
21060	8	" The human brain is a piece of work. Its the kingdom to our lives. It infuriates us, guides us, helps us and destroys us. Our brains can make our bodies feel anything it wants to. Its really something else. One of the most valuable things are brains are capable of is a sense of humor. Laughter. The ability to not take life to seriously for a moment. That light switch in @CAPS7 body that causes @CAPS7 brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is our brains only way of coping with the world. Scoping out the comical events life has to offer us. I am personally one of those people that finds everything in life funny, or will find a way to make it funny. I am hardly ever serious nor take things seriously. The same with my friends, we are always the people having a good time because we make life interesting. Maybe its our gnarly facial expressions we exchange one another, or we @MONTH1 just be funny looking. Either way we have a sense of humor. That's @CAPS4 life is about, @CAPS1 @CAPS7 happiness with people who fill @CAPS7 life with joy. @PERSON1 said, ""live simply, so that others can simply live."" I @CAPS9 we all can with a little sense of humor. Last year a couple friends and I went to mission ridge for a weekend to go snowboarding. We had it made, our own hotel suite with two king sized beds and a plasma @CAPS2. @PERSON2 and I slept on one bed and @PERSON3 on the other. We all have always gotten along perfectly and have shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between any of us. Other than a little midnight prank. On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON3 fell asleep first. @PERSON2 and I were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears. @PERSON2 was eating a bag of pop corn and started throwing little kettle pieces at @LOCATION1, trying to wake him up. ""@CAPS3, I have the funniest idea."" @PERSON2 whispered over to me. ""@CAPS4?"" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word @PERSON2 jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION2 tooth paste, a sack of coins and a package of peach rings. ""I had nothing to do with this."" I stated, continuing to glare at the television set. @PERSON2 began squirting out tooth paste onto @PERSON3's arms, she ran the creamy solution down his legs, back up to his face and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and penny's into the minty cement, along with the sugary peach rings. ""@CAPS5 is going to kill you."" I gasped. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 wont! It will be hilarious."" @PERSON2 blurted and then plopped back onto the hotel bed, admiring her work. @PERSON2 then picked up her bag of popcorn and resumed throwing pieces of kettle at @LOCATION1's face. The next morning was not how @PERSON2 planned. @PERSON3 woke up alright, but did not have the expression on his face @PERSON2 intended on. ""@CAPS7 done for @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 hollered. @PERSON2 smiled, still convinced this was all a joke. I saw the fury in @LOCATION1's eyes. @CAPS5 was beyond irate. His body crusted over with dried tooth paste. Quarters, dimes and penny's drilled into his skin and peach rings dangled moldy off his legs. @PERSON3 rushed into the bathroom to look into the mirror. @CAPS5 stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle clenched in his hand. @PERSON2 turned to face him and her smile disintegrated. ""@CAPS4 are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?"" @PERSON2 questioned, confused. @PERSON3 grew closer to @PERSON2, she backed away slowly, not quite sure @CAPS4 his intentions were. They both switched positions, her back now facing the door and @PERSON3 across the room by the window. @PERSON3 raised the shampoo bottle over his head. ""@CAPS9 fast."" @PERSON3 shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as @CAPS5 could at @ORGANIZATION1's face. But sadly, @PERSON2 ducked just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spewed out all over the walls. There was an indent of where the bottle hit the door. @PERSON2's whole back side was covered in blue sludge. I hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @PERSON3 reached @PERSON2 and immediately burst into roaring laughter. @PERSON2 sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON3 still crusted over, @PERSON2 covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on her back. I sat down with them, we all starred at each other without a word. everything was fine. It then occurred to me that @CAPS6 matter @CAPS4 we do to each other, enrage or try to explode one another, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay. Its that one value in life we can cherish forever."	20	25	45
21067	8	" It all started with a book @DATE1 @DATE1 ago. My mom had noticed I was struggling to find friends, so she took it upon herself to help me make some. She had a few friends from school who had kids of their own, some my age. I had been around these girls a few times as a child, but not recently. I'm not sure today what my mom saw in @LOCATION1 that made her think we would click, but she was right. What seemed like such a small action would change my life drastically. In @DATE2, in my new house I first met @PERSON1. That evening before she arrived I couldn't help but be very upset at my mom for doing this. I felt I was fine and fully capable of making friends myself. She acted like she knew me, but the few acquaintances I had she didn't believe would be good for me. I didn't think she could be right this time and I didn't want to waste my time. An abrupt knock on the door interrupted my train of thought, I could her muffled voices and footsteps downstairs. Quickly I retreated to my room and onto my bed. The bulky front door opened and closed again followed by footsteps coming up to my room. When @PERSON1 first walked into my room my first thought there was no way we would get along. She was a gorgeous blond girl, obviously popular and very confident. I couldn't stop thinking how she was going to call me freak and poke at my differences like the other girls at school did. ""@CAPS1, what are you reading?"" @PERSON1 asked as she sat on my bed. Come look for yourself."" I replied offering her the book in my hands. I knew she would hate this book. It was about all the microorganisms that live and feed off your body. I was right and as she leaned over cautiously @PERSON1 read the book with a disgusted look on her face. Laughter was boiling up inside me, I couldn't hold it much longer. My small, dull room buzzed with my laughter. @PERSON1 looked over at me with another strange look on her face and began to laugh along with me. Once the laughter had stopped and the ice was broken we began to talk about other interests. @DATE1 short hours flew by and we were finding plenty of things we had in common. We shared funny stories, introduced new music to one another, and talked about hobbies. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so in-tune with someone, especially someone I had just met! Suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a brisk knock on the door downstairs, we looked at each other and smiled. In that smile I saw a real person smiling at me with real pleasure showing through. Very much unlike previous encounters with kids at school. Downstairs we said our good-bye's to one another. As the new, cool @DATE3 air began to rush through the opened door I reached out to hug her. To my surprise she took my gesture and ran back to hug me. Her hair smelled of hair products and powder, a smell very unfamiliar but surprisingly comforting. Once she was gone for the night I began to think. I really liked @PERSON1 and I wanted to see her again soon. I felt accomplished in some way and fulfilled to have this bright future opportunity brought to me so easily and perfectly. Guilt also struck me as I realized how I had felt about @PERSON1 at first. For someone who had been judged through most of school I had been very hypocritical. That night I stayed up later than usual thinking about the next time I could see her, how she had looked and tried to understand how we could get along so well. Despite these questions haunting the edge of my every thought I slept happily, thinking of the next time I would get to see her. All of those @DATE1 questions and concerns have been answered in the @DATE1, and we are the closest friends. Not long after we started hanging out more often, we began to like one another a lot. One of my favorite parts about our relationship is how people get so confused to see us two different so close to one another. We can take the stares, comments and anything else we struggle with today and find a way to laugh together to reduce the importance of it. I have thanked my mom over these @DATE1 for many things, but mostly for what she has done for my relationship. If it hadn't of been for her my life would probably of been much darker. No one on that cold night expected this one meeting to evolve into our beautiful relationship. Laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship whether it is being built or being kept up. Thanks to laughter excelling conversation @DATE1 @DATE1 ago, I have had the best experience I could of ever asked for."	20	21	41
21083	8	 The members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled. Broken dishes are a common occurrence in our house; as are spilled drinks, stubbed toes, and blood-chilling screams whenever the toaster pops up. Though all of us are used to these types of things, not everyone around us is, which can lead to interesting encounters. Many people find pleasure in jabbing me in the sides to hear me scream, and laugh when I trip over the slightest crack in the floor. Though it can get annoying sometimes, it @MONTH1 also give me a reason to get over my pride and laugh at myself, thus relieving any tensions I @MONTH1 have been feeling about the social setting. For example, a few years ago I was staying with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 troop at @LOCATION1. Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating, but it is increasingly terrifying when the group is made up of girls, ages four to eighteen, with only a few adults thrown in to make sure the girls do not bludgeon each other to death. Worse still was that where I was staying, which was a hybrid somewhere between a cabin and a tent, the majority of the girls were in middle school and, needless to say, we did not always get along. Despite the fact that we were not all the best of friends, though, there were times when we were able to get past the petty differences, such as who was cool and who was not, and enjoy the time we had to talk and joke around with people who were in similar places in life. On one such occasion, I was attempting to make my bed on one of the top bunks, and was in the process of stretching my sheet over the petrified mattress which @MONTH1 have possibly been around in @NUM1 @CAPS3.C. Being the intelligent person that I am, I decided to lean against the wall behind me for balance, forgetting, of course, that there was in fact no wall, but only a thin, cloth-like material which could not support my weight. The second I realized what I had done, I reached about frantically for something to hold on to and tried in vain to keep myself from plummeting backwards to the floor and my certain death. Milliseconds before I would smash into the hard wood floor, I managed to grab a hold of one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on for dear life, swinging back and forth and back and forth. Finally, I let go and propelled myself, almost gracefully, onto the bed sitting underneath mine. It was a very long time before the laughter died down. In that short amount of time, cliques and biases and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a bunch of random girls placed in a room together, but a group with our own strengths and weaknesses; passions and flaws. Though the adolescent years are incredibly difficult and there are many times when it feels like you are the loneliest person in the world, it is always comforting to know that there are other people who laugh and cry just like you and experience many of the same joys and embarrassments as you do. One of the most essential skills to learn is that you have to be able to laugh at yourself from time to time and let yourself be vulnerable in front of other people. We @MONTH1 not all be the same, but we all have the same basic desires for love, acceptance, and laughter.	20	21	41
21111	8	" Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr. theres always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you dont experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to eachother that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for eachother. We had arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning, we were all a little tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS2.Pepper That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION3 fan you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS2.Pepper! oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON2 all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to take his @CAPS2. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to upack our stuffso that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON1 and I took all of his @CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things, we didnt want him to do that because he would then realize that we had took his pop, so we immedietly ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to exoeriencing another one of those @LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't 'till the night time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls we tired, not even @PERSON3, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Tme passed and we were all still awake, we were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON2's pop. We starred them down as if they were some prized possesion or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave, therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second biggest race of @PERSON3's life was going to take place, and ... we were still in bed! of course @PERSON2 got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock, we figured it would be @PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and big old bald man was standing there and said "" i'm only going to say this once"". I need my @CAPS2.Pepper. It was so funny we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because old bald man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON3 not racing card, we were terrified for our lives!, especially @PERSON3, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious, then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS2.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day, ""messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig, you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it"""	18	18	36
21122	8	" The wind rose and fell, whipping against the side of the house with full force. My mom said she had never seen such a fierce storm before in her life. It shook the house making it creak in odd places, like the floor boards. My @CAPS2 @PERSON1 sat at the kitchen table contemplating, worrying. They had rental houses acres off that were surrounded by trees, the ground was so soft ,so saturated by the rain and flooding that had taken over the valley. There were already hundreds of trees that had come uprooted there were bound to be more. The little homesteads that rested off of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 including my papa's were well built weathered farm houses,most were surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone out there with less then @NUM1 acres of land. It's wheat fields mostly, but you can easily find fields of corn, alfalfa, you'll find rows and rows of blueberries so big only @NUM2 can fit on the palm or your hand. It is literally paradise on earth, a small piece of heaven that was thrown down to earth by either accident or purposely. The sun is so bright and the sky is the clearest, most crisp blue. When weather rolls in giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like it's dappled with giant pieces of cotton. All this stretches over land so flat you wonder if it could possibly be real. I have spent so many wonderful , laughter filled summers there. Running bare foot through the fields, playing in the large expansion of lush, green grass. Feeding the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings. On @DATE1 my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short period of time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day she never would have let them get in that car. My papa, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2 pulled out of the driveway. Since it was a small car my @CAPS2 volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing it's vicious temper for over two hours, and it showed no signs of letting up. They had set out to see what damage had been done on their acres of land, to see what needed fixing once this storm moved on over the mountains. There is no explanation, no one understood why my @CAPS3 walked away with not even a scratch on his body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back end of the car, but it did. Gods hand had swept down and caused destruction. My @CAPS2 was killed instantly, my papa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, during those weeks the news of the accident spread like wildfire as news does in a small town. Everyone loved my @CAPS2, she was social butterfly that fluttered from person to person , laughing, talking , sharing tears, and joy. She knew everybody, and everybody knew her. The heavens cried and howled that day, rain drops fell so heavily it felt as if the whole world was crying, crying just for you just to share your grief. It's painful, to lose someone so dear to your heart. My papa cried, he sobbed until he had no strength left to feel any emotion at all. he loved her so much, he needed her . Lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my papa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparents initials. The lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, sign of how my papa and @CAPS2 had been struck apart quickly and forcefully. But, days before my papa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak and chained the severed part back together. With that my dad had made a symbol of his own, saying you will always be together just not physically, but you will never be truly apart. The day my papa returned home he saw the giant oak, and for the first time in weeks a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A small amount of hope had settled over everything once again. Her funeral was a nice affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came, they reminisced for hours, telling stories about my @CAPS2 and her crazy yet lovable nature. Then from across the room it came. Small at first then growing ever louder. Laughter. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter all the same I've never seen the saying "" laughter is the best medicine"" put to justice better. My @CAPS2 was one person who saw laughter, love, faith and hope as necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor."	25	21	46
21133	8	                       My @CAPS1  @CAPS2 was a warm, @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to be seen. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours straight. That person was my @CAPS1.  My @CAPS1, @PERSON1, came over to hang out with the rest of the family and friends that were at my house. He was talking, laughing, and having a really good time. Of course, I was only about five or six years old at the time; but to me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world. That @TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all of the adults. All of a sudden, my @CAPS1 came up to me, gave me a big hug and started to talk to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke around and laugh, I was thrilled to have all the attention. I used to call them laugh attacks. Anytime my @CAPS1 talked to me, I started laughing and I would laugh so hard that I couldn't stop. That @TIME1, I had one of them. My @CAPS1 and I were joking around and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. @CAPS2 went on for about an hour straight. That was long after my @CAPS1 left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION2, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop laughing. She was laughing too, but not as much as me.  Finally, after a long hour or so, I got myself to calm down. The rest of the @TIME1 was great but every so often, I started to laugh again. There was absolutely no way that I was going to stop giggling until I went to bed. After a long @TIME1 of having a good time, everyone left and went home. When my @CAPS1 came to say goodbye to me, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew that I would see him again. The next day, I was right about being able to stop laughing. I still smiled and hung out with my family, but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably.    My @CAPS1 was and still is a huge part of my life. He is always the person that can make me laugh and forget about all of my worries. Even though I don't live near him anymore, I can still talk to him on the phone and laugh and joke around with him. When I go visit him down in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 seems like we just pick things up where they left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other in a really long time.   When my dad passed away, my @CAPS1 was always there for me. He is the one male figure that I still have in my life. After everything that I've gone through, I could always count on him to brighten the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really do need a person like my @CAPS1 in their lives. @CAPS2 really does help to know that you have someone that loves you and can brighten your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @CAPS1 is very close, and the one thing that kept @CAPS2 that way is all of the laughs that we have shared through the years. Laughter is a huge part of anyone's life. I have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss, and sadness. However, after everything that I have come through, I can always come out laughing. When I was eleven years old, my dad passed away. At an even younger age, my parents got divorced. No matter how much those things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving on with my life.	20	15	35
21147	8	" Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all i wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1, do before his final days. I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time i didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had saw him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away."	20	20	40
21156	8	" It was a cloudy @DATE1, but nothing to be sad about when among friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, and they were heading home. I was among this group as a young @CAPS6 who had known this group for three years. Three years before, I was shy, but something changed that. The group was called @ORGANIZATION2. This @ORGANIZATION2 was for teenagers and even some collage students. There were very few of us though. It was our last year as @ORGANIZATION2, then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at. Together, we made that weekend be are best and last @ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very comfortable around the girls, so much in fact, that they were going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, then they would rub our feet. At @CAPS2 the girls thought this to be a crazy idea, but as time went on, that foot rub seemed really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a @CAPS6 in each. The boys sat in the second to last row in the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed @PERSON3's back, but it's okay. Out of all the girls there besides his sister, I know @PERSON3 the best, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very giggly time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys were falling asleep, the girls were laughing hysterically. Since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub, then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. This just caused more laughter, and more alert boys.  After we had enough with the foot and back rubs, then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster. It was the @DATE1 before @DATE1, so our @ORGANIZATION2 leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half. We would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up giving both @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 candy hearts that said, ""@CAPS1"". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. @PERSON3 accidentally gave one to @PERSON1 that said, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"".  Once that was beginning to become boring, then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining. We would read the heart @CAPS2, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @PERSON4 saying it was from @PERSON2 that said, ""@CAPS7 @NUM1 @CAPS4"". Whenever we had one that said, ""@CAPS9"", then we would give it to @PERSON1 saying it was from @LOCATION1. Earlier she had said to him, ""I thought you were @CAPS10 for a moment there"", but numerous people thought she said, ""I thought you were @CAPS9 for a moment there."" @CAPS11, we try to make it up to @PERSON1 for @PERSON2 by giving him ""@CAPS9"" candy hearts.  We ended that @DATE1 with hugs, goodbyes, and laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt just a little bit closer. We could hug this person @CAPS11, or we could get this person's phone number. Something in us changed that we could be a little closer.  In my experience, I would say that laughter is only one element, because to get laughter you need to love who your laughing with. If I didn't love the people I was in the car with then I would have not laughed with them. They say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I don't believe this is true. I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown. The statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed to never know either. Without love, there can be no laughter. "	20	20	40
21158	8	"                                  How @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only took one @DATE3 to change the whole purose of my @CAPS1. Two things that made my @CAPS1 more than I ever thought @CAPS3 could be; @CAPS4 and one girl. I realized over just one @DATE3 that there is more to @CAPS1 than what we see or hear. Emotions that you can't describe. Something that you have to live out for yourself. Looking back on three months of @CAPS1 changing events, I laugh at how fast my @CAPS1 turned and started heading the right way. Also how one girl can bring me to church and how @CAPS4 can keep a relationship moving strongly. We're part of a movement that will last forever. Her and I moving on the perfect path to eternity with eachother. Have you ever had a person in your @CAPS1 that made you so overwelmingly happy that @CAPS3 caused you to change your @CAPS1 plan forever? I have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. The first time I ever saw this girl. @CAPS3 was like a instant shock through my body. @CAPS3 felt like I needed her, like something was whispering in my ear,""go get her."" One day talking to my friend about this girl I couldn't get out of my head. I told him how I was going to talk to her @DATE4 and there was nothing that was going to stop me.  @CAPS6 said,""I have a class with her.""  @CAPS6 thought about her and I together; like in a relationship. In a intense thought @CAPS6 looked up at me and said,""actually I think you guys would be perfect together."" @CAPS7 that @CAPS6 said that I said, ""sweet."" I talked to her that day. She was better than I expected. I needed back up though. I had a different friend come with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall. So we started to walk over. We got to them and my friend just kept walking. Thinking in my head, ""what a great friend."" @CAPS3 was me alone with seven other girls. Trying to look the best I could look. What @CAPS7 me is I actually pulled @CAPS3 off. She actually thought i was attractive. Was @CAPS3 love at first sight? I don't know you tell me. Getting close to @DATE3. I got my license. Looking forward to what my @DATE3 was going to look like. All was looking really good. Until i found a job at a ice cream factory. Waking up at four in the @TIME1 wasn't the best way to start out my @DATE3. I still wanted to impress her and be with her all @DATE3. I met a guy named @PERSON1. @CAPS6 asked if I wanted to study the bible with him. I knew that @PERSON2 went to the same church. So i wanted to do @CAPS3.  About two months @DATE2 they went to a church thing over in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 was baptized there. Then @DATE2; after they got back. I was baptized. We both had @CAPS4 with us. Love was building up between us. What better to do than date? We started dating on @DATE1. Wonderful moments that I will never forget. That look she gave me like fire burning in her eye's with love. Going to the beach, driving around, fair rides, picking her up and never letting go.  Still with love burning inside of us. I went to her house. Lost track of time and noticed I was going to be late getting home. @CAPS3 was a rainy night. Saying good bye to her parents and giving her a big hug. I ran out the door, got in my truck, and took off. Couldn't see well. A corner popped out of no where. Started slidding across the road. A tree was moving toward me. I hit the tree. In mid flight. Time slowed way down. I thought is this @CAPS3. One picture popped into my head. @CAPS3 was her face. I landed with a big screaming sound. I got out as fast as possible. I came out with cuts and bruises but that was @CAPS3.  I thank @CAPS4 that I survied my crash. I am so lucky I didn't die. main oint is. I think I was put on this earth to be with her and thats what I'm sticking to. @CAPS3's times like these that make you realize how amazing @CAPS1 is. Laughing at @CAPS3 now. How laughter can change your @CAPS1 around. I finally said I love you girl. We are together to this day."	15	20	35
21178	8	" @CAPS1 is laughter important? In my opinion, laughter is very important! How could laughter affect someones life? If there was any, or not? Also, @CAPS1 is laughter important to me? Laughter is important for so many reasons. In a relationship, every day life, and with the ones you have in your life. How would the world be if there wasn't any laughter in this world? It would be very dry and dull. It helps connect people together, if they have the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is very important these days. A lot of people use sarcasm which isn't ""laughter"" but to some people it could be or some could feel hurt by it. However, most people that feel hurt by it,don't have a sense of humor in any way, shape or form. Most people have heard the saying, ""it takes more muscles to frown then smile,"" that is a very true and factual fact! Having a glorious relationship is the best thing with my significant other. The affectionate that he can be by sharing our laughter together, brings us closer to a point where we couldn't be at all if there wasn't for laughter and communication. Having a a sense of humor is a important thing in a relationship, to most people. @CAPS1 would you want to be with someone who bores you? Who @CAPS2't make you laugh when your sad? I sure wouldn't want that. Laughter brings out great communication skills, by laughing with someone it shows your type of opinion on the subject you are talking about. In a relationship, could you imagine if there wasn't no laughter in it? Would you feel the same about the person your with if there isn't any laughter? How would you feel knowing the person you love isn't very ""humorous"" and @CAPS2't like to laugh often? I couldn't handle that. I would want to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor.  Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I would rather be around very ecstatic people then someone who brings me down! I consider, laughter to be one of the most important things in my life, and in my relationship with my significant other. It brings us closer. People ask, "" @CAPS2't it ever get old being happy all the time?"" ""Of course not!"" I would say in defense. @CAPS1 would someone think that way? Being in a phenomenal mood all the time, would be the most amazing place I would want to be in my life and with my partner.  In my opinion, I would think that almost everyone would feel close to what I'm saying. However, people have their own opinions about laughter and how and @CAPS1 it's important, there are titled to their opinion. I know a few people, that don't like to be in a very cheery mood, that would prefer to be sad all the time and not care. Laughter could raise you up from that!"	15	16	31
21185	8	"It's true @CAPS8 they say, time flies when you're having fun. On a particularly warm @DATE1 @TIME1, a rehearsal was in session for the wonderful production of ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2"" and I was bringing my best friend, @PERSON2 some cheap but delicious food. We talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go. @CAPS3 we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building I asked if they needed any help with the play. ""@CAPS3 a matter of fact we do!"" @CAPS7 said enthusiastically. ""We need a ladies costume @CAPS4.""I had absolutely no idea @CAPS8 that meant, but I felt that the position had potential. ""@CAPS5, I can do that. Just one question..."" I said a little confused.""@CAPS6?"" @CAPS7 replied, slightly amused.""@CAPS8 exactly am I going to @CAPS12 doing?"" I asked her.We changed course and headed for the costume room so that @CAPS7 could introduce me to, @PERSON1 who would @CAPS12 my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @CAPS7 had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @PERSON2 told me the basic idea of the job.""@CAPS9 basically @CAPS8's going to happen is that you are going to @CAPS12 in charge of the changing rooms and the costume changes on stage."" @CAPS7 said quickly.""@CAPS11 okay, I can do that."" I replied with confidence.@CAPS3 I began to talk to her more about @CAPS8 I would @CAPS12 doing @CAPS7 said that @CAPS7 had to go because break was over. ""@CAPS12 here at @NUM1 tomorrow morning and you'll learn everything you need!"" @CAPS7 said hurriedly.@CAPS3 @CAPS7 ran off into the theatre I could hear the lead of the play beginning his lines. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice....""I left feeling more happy and excited than I have felt in months.  The next morning I made my way to the theatre which is located at the school which I previously attended. It felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal. I was even more comforted by knowing that I could see my friends everyday. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interaction! Something that because of online school I have been lacking. I walked into the theatre and @CAPS3 soon @CAPS3 I did I was bombarded with excited people asking why I was there while hugging me tight. ""I'm helping out with the costuming!"" I said just @CAPS3 excited @CAPS3 they were. I broke away from the group of people and found, @PERSON2 who was on stage directing the lighting people. We talked for a while and then @CAPS7 took me to the costume room where, @PERSON1 was waiting for me. @PERSON1, was a classy looking lady. @CAPS7 wore a light grey cardigan and a colored top with some corduroy pants and sensible shoes. Immediately @CAPS7 started to tell me @CAPS8 my duties were and @CAPS8 I was going to @CAPS12 doing that day.""I'm just going to have you watch the rehearsal today, just to get a feel of @CAPS8's going on."" @CAPS7 handed me a pen and a pad of paper""@CAPS15 notes about where the lighting ques are and that kind of thing."" @CAPS7 said.I walked out and wondered to the auditorium and took my seat in the second row of seats. The lights were lowered and rehearsal began. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice...""@CAPS16 I knew it, the end of the day had come and I wasn't in any hurry to leave. The actors and crew were doing such an amazing job with the play but I knew I had my work cut out for me. In the end it all worked out beautifully, we had some good shows and some @CAPS1 shows but the most important part of this experience was the time I got to spend with the people I love. I am going to miss them so much when I'm sitting in my room all alone doing the school work that consumes my happiness and laughter into the internet. on the other hand, I am all lined up to help with the next two productions going on at that old school of mine."	20	22	42
21188	8	" Allot of people say that laughter is a big part of any relationship, and i agree allot of people don't always laugh and in every relationship laughter is a big component to make someones day of the greatest day they have ever had. There is always someone who is having a bad time in school or at home or any other place and when you see someone like that you should always cheer them up like saying something nice or just even saying something like hope you have a good day @DATE3, give them a smile so that can put there bad thing that is avoiding them from laughing aside and you have just made there day by sharing your smile and laughter with them. Allot of people need someone they can go to when they are going through a very hard situation or problem they are going through that they cant go through it alone in there home or even at school and they need someone they can talk to and share there feelings with a shoulder they can cry on and that always makes someone feel good letting all that pain and inner self out to others we all need to make someone who is going through a hard time smile and laugh and that is always something very healthy in a relationship and it is a way to offer that person who is in pain or sad have e healing. This reminds me of a true story i know because i was there. One time there was a girl who i had in my elementary school she was a very happy girl she shared her laughter and happiness with others she was someone anyone could go to when they had a problem or they just needed someone to talk to she was one of the nicest girl in school everyone liked her and she tended to always show love and respect to others it always seemed as if her life was so perfect she had no worries she was just full of joy and she was only child in her family so of course her parents would always give her what she wanted or at least that's what we all thought. It had been a @DATE1 and we it came to be @DATE2 and we were all in school except this girl, she never missed a day of school so it was very strange for her not to be there, but just as every other person she must have been sick so that's what we thought except she missed another day and then another, and another, so i was starting to think she had moved away and she was probably never coming back, but the next week after that she showed up i was very happy to see her i had missed that girl except there was something very different about her she wasn't the same she wasn't laughing or smiling anymore she had lost that sparkle that made her so different. I thought to myself ""what is wrong with her?"" i finally found out that she had been gone because her mom had past away i was so sad i didn't know what to say she was just so happy and from one day to another she didn't have her mom anymore i thought i have both of my parents and she doesn't i should share the happiness she had share with me and others right back to her and be there for her now that she was gong through the hardest time of her life. That's why being happy and sharing your happiness with others always is the greatest thing you can do for someone because you never know what kind of things there going through and they need someone to make them smile and laugh."	17	20	37
21200	8	" @CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. ""@CAPS7,"" glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together."	15	22	40
21209	8	"Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said ""@CAPS6 go fishing."" @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad ""@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18."" @CAPS7 dad reply's ""@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20"	20	22	42
21211	8	Ever since I was born laughter has been a big part of my life without it I would be a very boring and grumpy person. Even tough I have experienced many moments full of laughter one specific moment always comes to mind. About a year ago my mom and I went on a trip down to @LOCATION1 to visit her family. It was the first time we had been there in over twelve years because my mom and I could not go visit them do to immigration problems. After all toughs years had past by my mom and I managed to get our legal residency in the united states. As soon as we got the residency we were free and could go visit her family without having to come back illegally. When my mom and I got to the airport in @LOCATION1 my mom started crying because she was full of emotions, for the first time in twelve years she was going to see her mom, dad, brothers, and sisters. As soon as we had gone trough all the airport security and baggage claim we made our way out to the exit where my grandpa had agreed to pick us up. When we got outside the airport a small little red @ORGANIZATION1 started getting closer and closer driving towards my mom and I. The car was no further then forty feet away when my mom suddenly dropped her luggage and started running toward the small red car I had no idea who the elderly person driving the car was. When the car parked an aged man stepped out of the vehicle and gave my mom one of the longest and most emotional hugs I had ever experienced in my entire life they must of been hugging for at least fifteen minutes just crying on each-others shoulders. When they had finished hugging my mom calls out my name and I start walking toward her. When I was face to face with my mom and the older man my mom tells me that the man was my grandfather then she looks at her dad and tells him to meet his grandson. For the first time in a very long time I had a grandfather I stood in shock for a while and so did he. He was amazed of how big and how much I had changed in toughs long twelve years that he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me. When I reached out to hug him he griped me hard and didn't let go he told me that this day had been the happiest day of his life.  Me and my grandpa started loading the luggage into his car so we could head home to meet the rest of my family. When we got done loading everything into the car we headed home. The long ride home was a bit weird and uncomfortable because there wasn't much talk in the car. It was about a fifty minute ride home when we reached our destination in a small little town out of the @LOCATION1 called texcoco. It was a nice little clean town with a lot of small stores and lots of two story middle class houses the streets full of cars and people walking or on bicycles very different to what I was used to back in the united states. When we got to our house there was a group of about twenty people that were family and friends outside the gate waiting for us. When we were done seedling in and got done meeting all our relatives we got together and had a family dinner. One of my uncles really stood out because he was really funny and always was acting like a clown he was the one that set the mood in the house or wherever he went. As days past by I was getting more and more comfortable with the people around me and started having fun. About two weeks past and my uncle @CAPS1 invited me to one of his stand up comedy shows. that day I experienced more laughter then ever before his jokes where original and true.In cunclusion laughter is one of the elements to life without I could not be happy.	17	16	33
21220	8	 Well it all started with the day he came to the airport. Missing him so much hardly ever getting to see him or have him return your phone calls like a @CAPS2 brother should, but it is always a blessing t see him and have him over for the holidays its amazing how he found time during the @DATE1 to come and visit us. it was well fortunate because now i didn't have to hear him cry all the time on its too cold and wet out here. So it was pretty good but because it was the @DATE1 it was normally about the time i go out and hang out with my friends and girls and now that started talking to this really beautiful girl that lives right around the corner from my house i was dying to go out and be with her but since time was really short with him i had to put my @CAPS2 brother first before anything.But then again every chance i got man i left and sneaked away to go see her. she was so beautiful so funny man she was s perfect to me it was crazy like a dream. I would tell my brother all the time about her. He would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that. It was the first day he spent the night everybody was so happy in the house from the time we picked up from the airport to the drive home talking making jokes about how much he changed how tight his cloths are. It was good we even stopped at burger-vile to get a couple burgers cause fat boy was so hungry all the time non stop eating. We shortly arrived home and the look on my little brother and sisters face was priceless there mouths open so wide like if they just saw god. As they came running towards he wasn't so prepared for it slowly still putting his bags down by the door he gets tackled and ruined over by a @NUM1 year old girl and a @NUM2 year old boy it was funny seeing them so happy and excited it was a surprise for them we were only supposed to get gas ha ha ha. Then after we sat down and talked all night when we rented movies earlier that day to watch, as a family but like my family nothing ever happens accordingly or on time. You know when your having fun and laughing you don't want it to end and you forget about everything let time go by and keep on doing what you do. But as time catch's up to you ad running on low energy because you been excited all day to see your @CAPS2 brother and to share story's tell jokes and laugh having a good time you get sleepy and in some real need of some rest like sleep in your bed in the covers and with the lights off, in silence. Oh good times having pleasant dreams of food and girls. Most of the time there put together in one hole dream after dream ha ha ha. Then we woke up had a great time shared some laughs in the morning cracking joke nonstop. Talking hanging out i got to take my @CAPS2 brother to some party's of mine which really scared my parents but it was funny at the same time cause before we left my mom was like okay we letting you g out don't get yourself into any shit @CAPS1 don't alright your dads going to b picking you up so don't be acting stupid look after your brother okay and right after i said yeah alright bet. i questioned it and was like what the hell? why do i have to look after my @CAPS2 brother he should be looking out for me. but i guess that's what made it funny. ever since then we had a good time and that's where this story ends with me saying goodbye at the airport to him. hoping that one day soon ill see him again soon.	15	15	30
21224	8	" Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2.....  It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION2, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS1 points out there's no more sugar. She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no lables on them. ""I think its the the jar on the left"", she said. I grab the jar on the left side without another word.  Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS1 and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Imidiately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in there mouths'. Suddenly my @LOCATION1 makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty..... not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers. She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of no where everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happend with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter is real. First, I was with my @CAPS1. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION1's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakeably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop imidiately and take the time to have a laugh.  "	20	23	43
21233	8	"                            Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS2 also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, ""@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?"" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS2 changes people, no matter what the age."	20	20	40
21236	8	  Every @DATE1 my family, friends, and I pack up for an exciting trip to @ORGANIZATION1. we always take our @CAPS3 runner, and boat along with us. We rent a large cabin that is right on the water side. We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degree's, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water. It is located over the pass about an hour from @CAPS1. Their are many fun activities to do at @ORGANIZATION1 like @CAPS2, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, boating, and lots more.   This was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and I was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather then my parents who go very slow, and they don't make it that much fun. He would always put one of us on the @CAPS3 runner to @CAPS3 the flag when one of us fell off, and one of us would be on the tube. One time he took me and my friend @PERSON1 out. It was in the latter afternoon, and that's when the water gets rough, and choppy. First @PERSON1 was on the tube and I was flagging on the back of the @CAPS3 runner with my brother. He would have us going around in circles at about @NUM1 mph. She ended up flying off right away.   Once @PERSON1 got up on the @CAPS3 runner I hopped on the the tube and i told my brother I was ready. We would do thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and @CAPS3 your arms around like your crazy to stop. He started going and I had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going. He started going really fast and I was flying every which way going in circles. Every time I would hit a @CAPS3 I would get whip flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and he didn't slow down he kept going faster, and faster. Then I waved my arms around to make him stop. @PERSON1 was the one watching me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally I did about two back flips into the water. I hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so bad.  It took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge gasp of air. I was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive over and pick me up. Something didn't feel right, I didn't have my bikini bottoms on any more. I started panicking and told my brother not to come over. I looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen. I told my brother and he called my dad. My dad and mom were on there way to bring me a pair of shorts because their was no way I was getting out of the water with no shorts on.   I had a blast at @ORGANIZATION1 and I have a great story that I will be telling for the rest of my life. I cant wait to go back next year and i know that I will be bringing an super tight shorts to go tubing in.	20	20	40
21245	8	" What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful? According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct. It had been almost two years exactly, since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would brings us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. @CAPS3 didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she revived a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. @CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" @CAPS2 and there @CAPS3 realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. @CAPS3 was very devastated about her grandmas lost, but @CAPS2 again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, @CAPS3 learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn form meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty- headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, its not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, its a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself."	20	20	40
21249	8	 It was the first day of the ninth grade, that terrifying day when one must choose how they are to be percieved for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds of long haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and that made it difficult for bullies to muster up the machismo to treat me as the freshman that I was. I sat down in my designated seat, next to one of the girls I could tell thought too highly of herself. Despite this off putting first impression, I atteampted friendship. My atteampt was met with confusion and disgust.  As I turned to face the front of the class once more, there stood the teacher. @PERSON1 announced that our first assignment was to create a presentation, one that would show the rest of the class who we are. I was excited at the prospect of a presentation. I have always been a showman, and the limelight is a very dear friend. I love to act, sing, and in general entertain. My crown jewel however, is humor. I have found that I can captivate an audience no matter the number, with humor. With this I designed a presentation to entrap and engage my class in the reality of who, and what I am. I wrote a speech in which I explained my talents and the many things I enjoy. In this speech were many twists and turns of phrase, punchlines and puns. There was such laughter that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise.  I took a bow and sat in my seat, looking around at the shining faces of my new friends. I knew then and there that laughter would be the tool with which i would build my highschool life. I could make someone forget about their troubles for a spell, or brighten someones day with a few words. I wasn't a star athlete. I wasn't even a star pupil. But I seemed to collect friends like I was made of fly paper. There is no better feeling i have yet felt, that compares to the company of friends. As long as i have humor, I shall never be without that feeling.	22	20	42
21253	8	 Laughter is the best way to bring people closer together. It creates a bond that makes you feel a little more comfortable and secure. Life would be sad and depressing if there was no such thing as laughter. Everyone has a different type of laugh some peoples are loud, quiet,weird, or funny.But our laughter is what makes us who we are.  There are so many effects in the process of laughing.Your laugh can have such a strong effect on your body that it can cause your eyes to become a little teary. Sometime when u laugh its also harder to breath and your stomach might start to hurt. When somethings really funny I usually have a hard time to get another gasp of air because i cant stop laughing.That's one of the effects that happens to me while I'm laughing. Everyone knows that when someone thinks somethings funny they laugh. We can laugh at a movie, a joke,or even a simple mistake.My family always makes me laugh.When we have party's were always laughing and cracking up jokes.One of the jokes that my cousins said is that my aunts baby was so white that it look like a came out of la lechera. Lechera is a @CAPS1 word.  Another thing that also made me laugh is when i went to my cousins house. We were watching a movie and i had to go use the restroom so i went and when i came out she jump out from around the corner and scared me. I screamed so loud that my other cousin yelled from up stairs to be quiet. I couldn't stop laughing i was scared but it was funny because she scared me out of nowhere and i never expected her to do that. I think of laughing as a gift. It is something that can always brighten our day.I love to laugh and there's so many unforgettable moments were i almost laughed till i peed my pants.I think the people with the best personality are the people who can make someone else laugh.	19	20	40
21256	8	" Boy says too @CAPS2:@CAPS1 weigh?, @CAPS2: what? Boy:@CAPS3 i just wanted too say something to break the ice!Laughter is the greatest thing too have in any kind of relationship, such as family, friends, and a romantic type relationship. It bring each other great bondage and makes the relationship playful.It was @DATE1 and i was on my way too pick up a long time no see friend too go to a warped tour concert. We haven't been in the greatest terms because of an issue that was upon us a few months ago. I figure to take my friend @CAPS4 to a concert shes been wanting to go too all year long. When we finally picked her up there was all sorts of tension of unleft said words to each other, but i wasn't gonna wait any longer too see what was about too happen.Before we headed too the concert my parents decided too get a car wash, @CAPS5 then i automatically thought of a few funny things i could do to make her laugh. The car moved as slow as a turtle into the car wash machine. I had left the window crack open to were enough water would crawl in. We were kinda talking about the concert and i had looked very unaware that my window was open, i actually had too no idea that a lot more of water then i expect had came in. She looked across at me and was like laughing so hard see couldn't even speck of what was happening. I looked at her and was like what? She was your windows open and i had turned and came too find water was rushing its way down and sorta frightened me and i jumped into the air and rushed too close the window. She was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was i. From that moment on it was such an ice breaker for all the tension that was happening. the elephant had left or side and we had a great rest of the day. See, it true""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". When laughter is happening no one is truly sad, mad or anything else. Laughter can bring too people who just meet good greetings, too couples closer together, friend and family joy and happiness. Laughter is truly the key to happiness. "	18	15	33
21271	8	" They say laughter is the best kind of medicine their is. So to tell you the truth on that qoate I will tell you a true story on laughter and how its a medicine. I already have recognized in believing it my self. I also will explain its key element in part of the world. So to start us off I will tell you a story that has laughter in which fixed a few ed between my grandpa @CAPS1 and my cousin @PERSON1. To start off it had happened about some time during the @DATE1. We were all having a blast. There was my cousins @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and his little brother @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and I. So @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I were minding are business playing games while our grandpa was watching us play and then out of no were we here a loud smack and then crying and screaming. So it had turned out that @PERSON1 ""slipped"" and smacked @PERSON3 who is only seven years old.Then our grandpa starts yelling and trying to figure out what the heck went down. After seeing @PERSON3's back with a big red hand mark on it that's when grandpa really let loose and just started going ballistic all over @PERSON1 but then @PERSON1 went home all piste. So later on @PERSON1 came back and then grandpa and I sat at the table talking to him. That's when I mentioned something that started to make every one laugh so hard that they all forgot what happened then he said sorry to @PERSON3 and we were all happy by the time grandma got home from work.So to conclude my story I wish to remind you on why laughter is an element or if it plays a part in something which was a true story in part of my life. So thanks for listening and when you or someone is down in the dumps or just really mad, laughter is the medicine for the job."	15	15	30
21277	8	"You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day? Well i would have to be agree to that because when I'm at school I would laugh all day long when i see my friend name @PERSON1. We would have fun all day long just the three of us in the same classes but two classes but we still be laughing in the halls and in the class rooms some times at each other and people that we don't know. I always loved coming to school last year but this year is not that much fun because @PERSON1 moved into the @CAPS1-es and I don't know where she lives now but after @PERSON1 left the good old days was fun with her it sucks that we are not going to the same schools with her or her still coming to school with us now it is just the two of us @LOCATION1 and my self we hardly have some fun in class without her but most of the days we do.   I remember when @PERSON1 first came to this school she look like the other girls in our class but once we got to know her we became best friends. the next day she though that we would not like her because is a new kid at the school and that stuff we got to know her all to well because we would hang out with etcher teacher back from the seventh grade we would hang out. The thing that i always love about @PERSON1 is that she would turn anyone whom is having a bad day and turn it into a really good day for you she would always do things like that but there are some days when she is felling down and blue and @PERSON2 and me would try to make her feel but she would just get mad at us because we wasn't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what. The next day she wouldn't remember what was going on yesterday because she wouldn't remember that much when she is really mad at someone. one time in one of my classes we was not doing much in that class because there was not that much people in there we were painting and me and @PERSON1 was painting bulletin board. the colors was white and brown we kinda of got it all over the place and each other i panted her hand haft brown and the other side white and she got some of it on the paper that we was using to let it dry up so we can paint again but that did not work out so good because we had to go yo our next class. The next day we was in that class we almost the same thing but we kinda of got it on the grand, sink, sops descender, and each other we draw a little something on each other i draw a heart that has her name in it her name was in pen and the heart was in paint. In our next class we was laughing the rest of the day we even got my sister @LOCATION1 to laugh with us even through it was not that funny because we ate a lot of candy and candy makes us laughter all the time. these days are the days that I'll remember all the time because @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and I are always laughing all that time because we always find something to laugh about and talk about. Out of all the times that i laugh the most fun ones are with my friend @PERSON1 because we would have lots of fun when we are with her she is the glue that was holding us together. I think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do we would laugh all that time. This one we would say ""like"" all the time in one of our classes that we would have all that time during fifth because we was the only two girls in there with four boys and a guy teacher so @PERSON1 and me would do almost anything in that class because we would not do anything that would get us in troble."	15	15	30
21292	8	" Laughter can change any situation. It can be used to break the awkward silence after a bad joke is told, to reminisce about a fond memory, or to clear ones head and create the feeling of calmness. In @DATE1 opinion laughter is a form of communication. I discovered this through the coarse of the @DATE1 through many different situations. Many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who I was able to connect with through laughter.  One of @DATE1 experiences with laughter has been with the many different exchange students that @DATE1 family has hosted. We have gotten exchange students from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION4. Most of them have rather good broken @CAPS1, but there were some words that proved difficult to describe and translate.  @DATE1 favorite exchange students was @PERSON1, a student from @LOCATION3. She lives in the northern part of the @LOCATION3, in the @LOCATION2 country. In the @LOCATION2 country they speak @CAPS2 and @LOCATION2 and culture is slightly different form the rest of @LOCATION3. What made @PERSON1 so enjoyable was her cheerful personality, her empathy, and her ability to make anyone in the room genuinely burst in to fits of laughter. I believe that this incredible ability of her's was one of the reasons that the summers I spend with her are some of @DATE1 happiest memories.  @PERSON1 could turn any activity into a lighthearted experience. I would do tasks with her like washing the dishes, a chore I didn't usually enjoy, and the entire time we would guffaw at the most outrageous things. Together we would laugh until tears were streaming from our eyes and we felt the need to go to the bathroom.  Once @PERSON1, @DATE1 best friend @PERSON2, and I spent an entire day laying in the grass at a park putting on ridiculous skits for each other, and telling comical stories, laughing until our bellies hurt. Between out bursts of laughter @PERSON1 would exclaim ""@CAPS3 you have got to stop this or I will surely explode, I have to use the restroom every ten minutes!"" @CAPS4 she would say this we would look at each other and be back to rolling on the ground laughing.  When I went to visit @PERSON1 in @LOCATION3 we had many similar situations of outrageous, uncontrollable laughter. One day we went to the @LOCATION2 parliament building with our families, @PERSON1, her sister @CAPS5, @DATE1 sister @PERSON3, and I couldn't stop acting goofy and cracking up. We toured through the serious quiet building unable to be silent or stoic, laughing at each other uncontrollably, making funny faces and dancing around, unable to contain our joy.  I don't know @PERSON1 @CAPS4 well @CAPS4 @DATE1 friends back home, but I think I will always feel a deeper connection to her then most people because with her I feel the free ability to laugh at every and anything. I have heard many different facts about laughter; if you laugh before an exam you will do better on it, moments of laughter are more prominent in your memories, and a person that laughs daily is more likely to feel less stressed and have a happier @DATE1, but the reason that I love to laugh is that it makes me feel really fantastic."	25	25	50
21296	8	 School had just gotten out. It was the @DATE2 before my senior year. We had been planning this camping trip for the @DATE1 few weeks. We were so excited about it that that's all we could talk about. This would be the first camping trip we had been on without our parents. It would be the best four days of our lives. Sand, the beach, friends, quads, no parents; how could it possibly get any better than that?  We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people that were there, the more fun it would be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I did all the shopping the day before. We got lots of yummy stuff to make. After we got home from shopping we had to load all the bikes in the toy hauler. We each took two bikes, and we took @ORGANIZATION1's boyfriends bikes over so he could just drive over after work. We were up almost all night packing, trying to figure out the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a nice weekend at the coast, we could already tell. It was the middle of @DATE3, the sun was shining and it was beautiful outside. The next morning we got up and double checked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes, and those sorts of things. Then it was off to get gas and finally head to the coast! Once we got on the road the music was blaring and the windows were down, just like always. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there. When we finally did get there, there was a really cute guy setting up his tent in one of our camp sights. I asked @ORGANIZATION1 who he was and @CAPS2 told me it was @CAPS1 (her boyfriend) best friend, @PERSON1. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came over to help. The second I layed my eyes on him, I knew he had to be mine. In the next hour or so we got all unloaded and set up. By then many more people had shown up.We helped everyone else get all their things unpacked and set up so we could go on a ride. Our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect. It was warm enough to ride in t-shirts. We didn't stay out for long though. People started to get hungry so we went back to camp, made dinner and sat around the fire. There was probably twenty or so of us sitting around the fire, talking about everything from the stars in the sky, to the sand on the ground. Every time I would look up I noticed that @PERSON1 was looking at me. He would just smile, and look away like it was nothing at all. As usual, @ORGANIZATION1 started telling us about a funny incident that had happened to her in the @DATE1 ( @CAPS2 was such a klutz.)We all started laughing as @CAPS2 was showing us her bruises from falling down the stairs. @PERSON1 and i locked eyes.  Later that night @PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go on a walk. We walked all the way on the sand trail out to the dunes, and all the way to the top of a giant dune called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we got to the top we sat there, staring at the stars, talking. We realized we had lots of things in common. We liked to do all the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh.   Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, it means a lot. No one has ever been able to make me laugh the way that he does. I never knew that laughing could bring two people together the way that it did that one night at the dunes..	20	20	40
21299	8	" Laughter is said that it is the medicine for happiness. Those who laugh frequently end up having an overall better life. They are in better moods throughout the @DATE1 and affect people around them with their upbeat mood. Many solid friendships involve laughing frequently. I am lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh. Their was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at @TIME1.  My freshmen in high school was my second year total in public school because I was previously home schooled by my parents. I just established friendships with four other people earlier that year. They were my friends @PERSON4, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3. None of us ever been to eachother's houses yet, so I suggested to be the first one to all have them over on a @DATE1. We did not know yet exactly what we wanted to do at my house, but we knew with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they came over one by one we watched football on the @CAPS1 until the entire gang was at the house. Once the last person, @PERSON2, came to my house we all went outside to find something to do. All of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football. Unfortunately all of us were linemen except for @PERSON4. The problem was that we had what is called ""linemen hands"" which means that we could not catch a football due to having hard hands. This created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was way to funny.  Later that @TIME1 we all decide to grab the immense amount of junk around my property ,and like most boys our age, started to fight with them. This battle continued for most the @TIME1 and people got hit in the funniest of ways. After we were all tired from the running around we decided to make scary movie with my mom's video camera. This is when the most laughter of the whole @TIME1 came. We all sat down to make out a plot for our movie and kept distorting it in different ways to come to some agreement on what to base it off of. We decided to make the movie seem like it was off of ""@CAPS2-field"", a movie about aliens invading earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. As we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly. Unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up. @PERSON4 was supposed to be on the ground with a gash down his side when we found him, but when we filmed that scene @PERSON4, who was supposed to be unconscious, could not keep a straight face when we found him. Since he had a goofy smile when we picked him up and with the awkwardly said line from @PERSON3 ""The window is open, @PERSON2 is gone"" we all started to burst out laughing. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake @PERSON4 up and try to find out what happened. @PERSON4 said ""I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance"" and then @PERSON1 responded ""@CAPS3 that's not gonna happen!"". That line that @PERSON1 said was not in the script and was just way to funny to keep it in and in a result we all started bursting out laughing once again. We tried to redo the scene, but when I said ""@CAPS4 are you laughing"" we all burst right back into uncontrollable laughing. Later in the movie the last guys alive were @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and me. We were casing the psychopath outside in the pitch-black dark. Randomly @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to. This caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran. After all the scenes were done and we finished the movie, we all went back into my living room, spooked from being outside in the dark for so long making a scary movie. My sister randomly comes home without us noticing. She stares through the locked front door with out making a sound in a very creepy way until we all notice her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air due to being extremely scared. After we settled down we all joined in the laughing once again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were.  In conclusion, the laughing that went on throughout @TIME1 made us closer as friends. Every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to create a strong bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed that way. END "	20	21	41
21306	8	"Don't speak, laugh. I love @CAPS11 little brother. We're @NUM1 years apart in age @CAPS7 from the way we act, @CAPS3'd think we were twins. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 matter how close we are, we still are siblings, and we still fight. Usually they're just petty little fights that we get over in a matter of seconds, @CAPS7 this one was one @CAPS4 could not back down from. I beat him at @CAPS1 tennis. @CAPS14 was a warm afternoon, and me and @CAPS11 brother had just gotten back from school. We usually relax for a little before we do our homework by challenging each other at playing @CAPS1.  ""@CAPS3 cheated."" @CAPS4 said firmly. ""@CAPS5 I didn't!"" I snapped back. I could tell that @CAPS4 was getting really upset about this, @CAPS7 I didn't care. I wasn't going to let him win this one. ""@CAPS6 yes @CAPS3 did. @CAPS3 always do! @CAPS14's not fair."" ""@CAPS7 I didn't this time."" @CAPS4 was telling the truth. There are times when I cheat by distracting him during a game, @CAPS7 I won fair and square. ""@CAPS3're just mad because @CAPS3 lost. Get over yourself and take @CAPS14 like a man."" That's all I had to say to make him throw down his controller and make him run upstairs crying. ""@CAPS6! What did @CAPS3 do to your brother?"" @CAPS11 mom yelled. ""@CAPS4 beat him at a game and now @CAPS4's mad."" I knew @CAPS4 would do that. @CAPS17 and report me to @CAPS11 mom hoping that she would save him and get me in trouble. ""@CAPS13 @CAPS14's just a game. @CAPS3 can't win every time."" ""@CAPS14's just not fair!"" @CAPS4 said before slamming the door of his room. Sweet, sweet victory. I love when I win. @CAPS14 makes me feel superior. @CAPS7 of course that little feeling of guilt of making your little brother cry came over me, so I went to @CAPS17 and apologize. ""@CAPS13?"" I knocked on his door. ""I'm sorry for making @CAPS3 cry. @CAPS14's just a game though. @CAPS3 win some and @CAPS3 lose some. Don't be mad."" I gave the most heart-felt apology I could think of at the moment. ""@CAPS17 away. I don't want to talk to @CAPS3."" @CAPS17 away?! I walked all the way upstairs to tell him I was sorry for something that I didn't even need to say sorry for, and @CAPS4 tells me to @CAPS17 away? Oh @CAPS5. @CAPS5. @CAPS5. @CAPS5. After processing what had just happened all that could come out of @CAPS11 mouth was, ""@CAPS19."". And I walked off.  The rest of the day went on. We passed each other many times without even acknowledging one another. I couldn't believe that @CAPS4 was this upset about @CAPS14. @CAPS14 was probably one of the longest periods of times @CAPS4 didn't talk to me by choice. I started feeling really bad, even sad that @CAPS4 wasn't talking to me. I decided to try talking to him again. Only problem was, @CAPS4 was downstairs playing the @CAPS1 again and I was upstairs this time. I came out of @CAPS11 room and started to walking down the stairs. @CAPS4 could hear me coming, so @CAPS4 turned down the volume of the @CAPS21.  ""@CAPS13 listen. Are @CAPS3 really not going to talk to me over a game I-"" @CAPS23! All of a sudden, I was sliding down the stairs. ""@CAPS24!"" @CAPS4 was laughing at me! I landed at the bottom of the staircase and started to laugh too. We were both laughing! That's all we needed to start up conversation again. Just a little laugh."	20	26	46
21315	8	"Laughter: A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of the variety of emotions expressed by humans, there are emotions that represent different qualities. While furrowed brows @MONTH1 be associated with displeasure, anger, or even confusion, laughter is an action connotative to mainly one emotion - happiness. Although emotions are relative aspects of human nature, actions such as laughter exist to transcribe an emotion like happiness into physiological expressions that humans are able to understand. Due to this unique quality as an action, laughter is often a key element in developing relationships. Over the years, I have found that laughter is crucial because of three various reasons - laughter does not separate, it is an ability that all members of the human race have in common, and additionally, it brings down personal barriers. In many aspects, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""; instances of laughter are @CAPS1 anecdotes. Unlike sentiments such as jealousy, fury, or sorrow, happiness is an emotion that tends not to separate. While jealousy, fury, and sorrow can cause such discontentment between people to the point of physically and emotionally driving them apart from each other, happiness does no such thing. Happiness is conducive to laughter, and because of this, laughter congregates people together, rather than dispelling them apart.  In addition to its compelling nature, laughter is also a @CAPS1 action. In a general view, laughter gives humans another point at which they are equal; the ability to laugh is one quality humans share. Even infants, in their states of vulnerable dependency, are able to emit laughter. Laughter is also able to establish starting points for new relationships, because sharing a laugh is akin to establishing commonalities between people. Whether the commonality be a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a surprise, sharing a laugh automatically institutes a link between two or more people. Additionally, while laughter can begin new relationships, it can also solidify them. Often, as laughter is shared through common experiences, having common experiences to laugh about symbolizes a relationship between people in itself. Since laughter is mainly about relationships and interactions between people, it is also about building trust. Establishing connections between one person and another, regardless of how weak the connection might be, requires some form of trust. Laughter is often able to bring down emotional barriers because it requires a sense of kinship and camaraderie. Through laughter, we as humans are able to bring down notions of suspicion or anxiety. As stated before, laughter establishes commonalities and therefore is an activity that exudes a sense of trust and reliability. This razing of emotional barriers is another way in which laughter is able to bring people closer together.  Laughter is a @CAPS1 action that ""personifies"" how similar members of the human race are. It is astounding how man is able to discern qualities such as reliability and trustworthiness simply through the complex, yet basic, act of sharing a laugh. Through laughter, people are subconsciously able to make emotional connections with their fellow human entities and in doing so, are able to take interaction to an emotional level. Laughter is the true story behind human relationships worldwide. Not only is laughter the @CAPS1 language, laughter's intimate nature renders it the shortest distance between two people."	20	15	35
21339	8	@PERSON1                               @CAPS1 @CAPS2 One @DATE1 of @DATE1 break me and a @CAPS3 went @CAPS1 with my @CAPS5 on the boat in @LOCATION1. We have been waiting all week for to go catch some @DATE1 @CAPS4 salmon. That @DATE3 @TIME1 we had to get the boat ready so we can leave that day. Our boat is big so we just put all our stuff in it, like sleeping bags, coolers of food, and all the @CAPS1 gear we would need for salmon. we also brought a camp stove for our food we make on the boat. There was also another guy named @PERSON2 but we call him big @PERSON2 hes very funny guy that provided a lot of laughter on the boat.When we get there we had to stop at a bait shop to get some prawns and spinner blades, that's what we use to catch the salmon.  We leave and soon as we get to the boat ramp were we launch the boat my @CAPS5 realizes that he forget to get hooks while we were at the shop. So we pull the boat out of the water, luckily the boat was still on the trailer, we get all the stuff all secure in the boat again and leave to the shop. Right as we get to the bait place the lady we talk to earlier said we forgot to grab the hooks we bought, some how we did forget I don't know how though. So we say thanks and headed back to the river. We finally get our boat in the water and head up river to were we are going to do our @CAPS1, and it is a popular place there would be a line of boats called a hog line and some how we would always some how get in the middle where the best @CAPS1 is. There would be some days usually @DATE2 like @NUM1 boats on each side of us and it got hectic and some times funny because some of the guys out there don't even know how to operate a boat.  When we got there after we geared our poles up we put them out in the water, my pole went down and hooked a nice bright @CAPS4 and fought him for about fifth teen minutes and my @CAPS5 netted it and it was a keeper fish. After all that my @CAPS5 said that was a small fish. Right around dark we reeled are poles in and put them away neatly in the boat. Right when it got dark it was time for bed and it was quite on the river there was no one on the river besides so we didn't have to worry about other people rocking our boat while we were sleeping. The next morning was cold and windy but luckily we brought our top to cover us from getting wind burn, because last time we went we got wind burnt so bad it hurt for about a week. finally my buddies pole goes down and hes all excited about hooking a fish, about ten minutes go by and he realizes he hooked on a log that floated by, me and my @CAPS5 knew he hooked on it but we didn't want to say any thing because it would be funny him getting all excited. My @CAPS5's pole goes down and it was fish on, so i throw the anchor out we float down get it in the net another fish too take home and we had two in the boat but my buddy is the only one that needs to get a fish so we all have one to take home.  After all day of being on the boat it was about time to head off home and get ready for the begging of the week. Right about two o clock, I look over my pole tip slams to the water another fish on hand it to my buddy he's fighting it, he was having trouble reeling though because the drag was tight but then i fix it he gets in the boat, his first salmon ever he was happy. perfect timing, because about fifteenth minutes later we leave to go home. the @CAPS2 was fun we got some fish, we had some funny moments, and most of all I got my buddy his first salmon.      	17	17	34
21345	8	"Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."	15	17	32
21348	8	"  In all of our lives there is that one person that is so special you would never do anything to hurt them. Whether that person be a close friend, a significant other, or a family member. The people that are involved in our lives significantly are there to help us through the rough patches, bring us up when we are down, and be there for us. Friends are one of the most important people we have in life. Friends are someone we can talk to and they understand, someone we share everything with including clothes, food, etc. They are the ones that get us through each day with a smile. High school is filled with drama, it's the same old story just, a different day. I have the best group of friends, we are very close and spend a lot of time with each other at school and outside of school. They are there for me when I need them the most. Recently this guy, @PERSON1 and I have been trying to work on our relationship but he had been lying to me and cheating on me but everyone of my friends that I talk to abut the situation say the same thing, ""he is going to hurt you"" and ""he's not worth your tears."" I have class with him every other day. It's not like I get to choose when I want and don't want to see him, some days are just better than others. The bell rang, right after lunch, and I wasn't in any hurry to get to the band room. The band room is very big, smells like old cheese and is like a trampoline for sound to bounce off of and explode in your face. I don't enjoy that class at all. I walked in the room nonchalantly and set all my books on my chair and began walking to my cubby. I grabbed my instrument walked back to set it on my chair and went to talk with some of my friends. It hadn't been a bad day so far, it was just a regular day at school. Entering the band room I had a feeling that @DATE1 was different. He walked through the band door with a huge smile on his face but I couldn't help but look away and frown. Mixed emotions are the worst, he does one thing and you love him and he does another thing that drives you insane and makes you want to hurt him. He sits right behind me in band and I am constantly turning around to talk to him but we never seem to get in trouble except for @DATE1, we were supposedly talking to much. I don't believe we were talking to much, because @DATE1 was where I wanted nothing to do with him. He was upset with me and I was upset with him, so we were even. Twenty-five minutes passed by, each minute dragging on longer and all I was thinking about was him and what I had heard he was doing. It's never a good feeling when you know something is wrong. I confronted him about what people were telling me. His response was ""don't believe what you hear, believe what you see."" I didn't know what was going on, but tears started pouring out of my eyes, running down my face like a crystal clear waterfall. I asked my teacher if i could take a minute out in the hall, and she agreed, so I sat in the hall, with tears running down my face. One of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me. We started talking and I told her everything that was going on. She gave me a hug, and start making jokes about him. I couldn't help but laugh. I even smiled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well. After a few jokes, and a bunch of hugs, the tears went away and I was smiling. Neither of us wanted to go back in class but we didn't really have any other options. We weren't very close friends, but our talk during class, made us grow stronger. Even when everything is going wrong, you should count on your friends to tell you the truth, and give their advice, because they are always right so don't second guess them. They know how to make you feel better and it always seems to work. Laughter is much more than an emotion. It gives you strength when you are weak. It builds you up when you are down. Laughter brings relationships closer, and sometimes all we need is to smile. Laughter also helps create memories, the nights you stay up talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever. Laughter is an important aspect to everyone, we all need a day to just relax and take a step back to laugh."	20	19	40
21352	8	"                   The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS3. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet. Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?"" ""@CAPS6"" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?"" I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS6"". He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner."	17	20	37
21358	8	"Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 do things like music, tears and laughter have in common? @CAPS19're all universal languages- @CAPS19 surpass any @CAPS1 barriers to get the point across without words. @CAPS21 was definitely the case the time my @CAPS3's best friend @PERSON3 came to visit from @LOCATION2.  I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my @CAPS3 announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my @CAPS3 was encouraging. ""@CAPS4 will be a learning experience!"" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. ""@CAPS5'll learn some @CAPS6, and @CAPS19'll learn some @CAPS7.""  @CAPS4 was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when @CAPS19 arrived. As @CAPS19 pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I @CAPS12 felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my ""@CAPS9"" @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @CAPS9 @PERSON3's rich voice: ""@CAPS11! @CAPS5've gotten so tall!"" @CAPS12 I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my @CAPS9: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon @ORGANIZATION1 had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to @ORGANIZATION1's three children. I realized that I didn't know @CAPS2 to say- or even how to say anything to them. While @PERSON3 was bilingual, yet she didn't speak @CAPS7 around her children. There was a total @CAPS1 barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. @PERSON3 bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @PERSON1, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old @CAPS14, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, @PERSON2, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as @PERSON3 introduced me and my sister @CAPS15 to them. As @CAPS19 chattered back at her in @CAPS6, I marveled at how clever @CAPS19 seemed for speaking another @CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my @CAPS7 sound to them?  My @CAPS3 soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and @PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to ""catch up on life."" For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @CAPS4 became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. ""@CAPS18 don't @CAPS5 go show them your rooms?"" my @CAPS3 suggested. ""@CAPS19 still haven't met @CAPS20!"" @CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, since @CAPS20, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. @CAPS15 and I led the way to to find him while the @CAPS23 talked in hushed @CAPS6 voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, @PERSON2 @CAPS12 let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to @CAPS20, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @CAPS20 did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @PERSON2's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so @CAPS4 turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, @CAPS19 looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of @CAPS4, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the @CAPS1 barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because @CAPS4's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @CAPS1 we did have in common- laughter."	23	23	46
21366	8	" I slowly got up and watched as paint dripped off my face, my hair and clothes. A trail of paint followed me as I tried to hop from one clear spot on the floor to the next, but there weren't many clear spots. All that I could think of, was if I was going to make @CAPS5 to high school, or not. Trying my hardest not to get anymore paint on the ground, I opened the door carefully, and called out. ""@CAPS1...Hey mom?"" I yelled half-halfheartedly, as I glanced back at the ""painted"" room.  ""@CAPS2?"" she hollered back up the stairs.My mouth wouldn't open, I was afraid to answer. I've messed up millions of times, but none have been this bad.  ""@CAPS3, you see... I've had a paint withdraw from the paint pan."" I replied softly, hoping she would not hear me.  ""A paint withdraw?"" she asked in a confused tone, as she walked up the stairs to see what has happened. I closed my eyes in fear as she turned the corner.My mind raced as I tried to prepare myself for a rant about how I have to be more careful, and punishment. Neither came. She started to crack up.  I was @CAPS8 confused at the sight of my mom sitting on the floor, almost peeing her pants. I then realized that I was probably a sight to see. I was covered in paint from head to toe. I started to giggle as I took in the situation, only something like this would happen to me. Minutes later we finial got a hold of ourselves and mom went to go get some paper towels to clean up my mess.  She came back upstairs carrying a role of paper towels and a plastic garbage bags.""@CAPS4 thing I put the plastic covering over everything, before I let you paint."" she stated, smiling at me. ""@CAPS5 would have been way worse, if I spilled the paint all over the carpet."" I replied, returning her smile. I started to gather up the plastic covering, revealing the unsoiled carpet. The garbage-can was as full as a stuffed @LOCATION1 on @CAPS6. After we gathered up the last of the plastic covering, I slammed the garbage-cans lid as I put the last bit of plastic covering in. My mom came in carrying @CAPS7, and a handful of paper-towels.  ""@CAPS8 what made the paint pan have sudden withdraw of paint, @CAPS9?, @CAPS10 you trip on the plastic covering, or drop the paintbrush in the pan?"" she questioned me, as she gave me a confused facial expression.  I didn't know what to say. "" I...@CAPS1, @CAPS3, I was on my way to paint the edges against the ceiling, when I took my first step on the ladder and slipped. Landing in the paint pan and receiving the paintbrush in my face"" I didn't mention the fact that I tripped on my shoelace. My mom always got on me, for leaving my shoes untied. My mom started to laugh uncontrollably again. She started to turn beat-red. I could not believe her reaction. The situation was @CAPS8 funny, I started to laugh again as-@CAPS3. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined anyone forgiving me in such a big way.  Once we finally stopped laughing, my mom and I finished cleaning the mess. My mom and I remember this day as a time we got to bond. I now realize that my mom will understand, and forgive me for my mistakes, no matter how big they are. "	20	21	41
21369	8	 Laughter is the key I think that being happy is a big part in life because, being happy feels so good. If I was in a relation ship that was not happy I would not like it at all. In a happy relationship comes laughter,the first thing I do wen I meet someone I always smiling and telling jokes because if I tell jokes and they are laughing they know that I am a happy person. If you meet any person weather it is a grown up to a friend to a person you want to go out with they will always enjoy laughter. Lets just say me and my girlfriend when I first saw her she was sitting in a desk in my history class crying and I asked if she is okay and she told me her story after she told me her story I told her how it feel and then I told her a joke and she laughed.After she got done laughing she ask me for my phone number and then that night we started dating. I asked her what she likes about me and she said the way I make her laugh.  I always love to make my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and my self. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy it would be a better place because I rather laugh and be happy then be mad or sad about something. when I was growing up I was by myself all the time so i had to learn how to keep myself happy so I would think about funny stuff I have seen or said in the past and try to make a story about it and it worked.When I got older i started doing stand up comedy. It made me feel so good seeing all the people laugh. then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night I will never forget that night.If i had to pick what I wold want to do for fun I wold be a comedian.Thank you for reading this and have a nice day	15	14	29
21370	8	 My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past trageties, future mishaps, and current mistakes--loss. Life is a puzzle i can not figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I pounce into life. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way--to long. It sends the wrong message to those who can not tell if the mask is real, or perfectively put on. That is the message I want to give, right? Pretty soon, my laughter diminishes, my smile lowers, and my lips began to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding, and being squeezed at the same time. The eyes are becoming moist, they began to sting, and reden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me. Only pushing me to breakdown, which is something that is unexceptable. Peace, is the only thing needed at the moment; and of course, my best friend, tissue.	16	15	31
21373	8	" In the ninth grade I was required to give a speech about a book. The speech was to be persuasive, like a television or radio advertisement. I am awful at giving speeches. Before speeches my hands get clammy and cold, I experience ""hot flashes,"" and occasionally get nauseous. During speeches my eyes frantically glance around the room, my breathing pattern changes to quick short breathes. Almost in sync with my glances. At the end of my speeches I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock. I do not speak, I do not laugh, and I feel like hiding. Luckily, @CAPS4 speech was different. My @CAPS1 class had all girls and one boy. Not to say I am sexist, but having the majority of the room being female did help. Girls have a way of acceptance, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer.  So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the average classroom setting of ""speech giving time,"" (when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other) the classroom was zoned in on me. Today @CAPS5 felt like everyone was ready to hear me no matter what I really had to say, and how professional @CAPS5 came out. I felt superior, as if I had the power to alter their lives, almost so superior that I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat @CAPS5 up (@CAPS2't that what advertisment is? Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea, and hiding the bad things?). The group looked so innocent. Today I was ready to give my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance, and a smile. I began. My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around @CAPS5 to serve the purpose of a television. @CAPS4 also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the ""actors."" @CAPS3 the first few lines of the speech my group of classroom peers laughed, @CAPS4 was not what they had expected. I am a shy, quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class. I wear things like semi-large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world. A lot of times when I give speeches people laugh, but usually a negative laugh. The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone. @CAPS5's also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter, that just makes the speech a introduction and an ending, bodiless. So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction. The sound of @CAPS4 laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech.  At the end of my speech everyone clapped. They always clap. @CAPS5 is required to clap. @CAPS4 clap was different, @CAPS5 was clapping for the success of the speaker, a clap that said ""@CAPS4 speech had a clear purpose, and made the audience want to keep listening."" @CAPS5 was not a pity clap. Then I smiled. My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded. That I had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what I had to say, and that they had comprehended @CAPS5, and maybe that they would now want to read the book. @CAPS4 was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech. I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying, @CAPS4 was a definite improvement, and also a factor of why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes and comments. Lastly, my puppets also had a introduction, body, and conclusion to their babble. Usually I get so nervous I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel and disrespectful. My speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively. The laughter of the audience was cheery, happy, encouraging, and accepting."	20	20	40
21388	8	        Family trip @CAPS1 the @DATE1 my family and I decided to have a trip to @LOCATION2. My father, who had recently woken up from a comma, was in a state of depression. The doctor recommended that my mother should start planning family activities and do some over the @DATE1 break. I was twelve at the time, and noticed how my father was coping with the fact that he had both of lost his arms. He tried to hide the fact that it was too much for him to handle, but that only worried us more about his health. My mother, along with my sister @CAPS2 and I decided to go out on a trip -to distract my father- and hopefully get him out of his depression.  On the day of the trip we headed out at about @NUM1 am from the apartments. My mother was the type of person who would always be early for anything. Overnight we had packed our bags and already had the stuff in the car. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I helped my father -since there was no way for him to keep himself balanced- while going down the stairs. He didn't seem enthusiastic about the whole trip, but I made sure to get my sisters excited and they kept on talking with my father in the car. A few hours later, one by one my sisters started falling asleep then my father started sleeping. My mother was starting to get drowsy so I stayed up and started talking to her about random subjects. As I kept her company she began telling me stories about her childhood - the laughs she would get when her cousins pranked one another- and so on. Some of the stories were so funny we tried not to wake everyone up with our laughter. Even though she had lived a rough childhood, her cousin @PERSON2 was the one that had always known how to make her laugh.  My father and sisters woke up and started to get carsick, so my mother ended up exiting towards @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. As we began to look for a gas station we began to hear loud music, and as we got closer we noticed that there was a carnival in the middle of the city. My sister @CAPS2 who was @NUM2-years-old at the time began complaining along with @PERSON1 who was eight-years-old. I tried to convince my parents, and my mother agreed but my father only got mad. That was until my sister @CAPS4 who was @NUM3-years-old began on ranting on and on, until my father finally agreed.  My mother parked the car at the nearby park and my sisters ran ahead of us to the carnival. My mother tried to catch up with them while I locked the car from the inside. As we arrived to the carnival, we saw stands filled with jewelry, clothing, and other small items. We kept on walking and saw a group of gypsies dancing on stage. Later on a comedian went up and he made everyone laugh in the audience. After watching the gypsies and the comedian, we started to look around. We ended up buying three @CAPS5 parasols and the fourth parasol was free. We thanked the saleswoman as we opened our parasols for some shade. The @DATE1 heat was starting to get worse, so we headed towards the car.  As we reached the car, my mother's face turned pale, she had left the car keys inside. She began arguing with me, and I began regretting the whole trip. I was exhausted and didn't want to argue. My father finally interrupted by telling us that he was going to search for a wire hanger from one of the stands in the carnival. As he left with my sister @PERSON1, the rest of us began walking towards the park. @CAPS4 began pouting and my mother kept on blaming me for locking the car, meanwhile I pretended I was deaf. After my father came back with a wire hanger, I began straightening it out and bending one side to create a hook. After many tries I still couldn't open the car, and my arms began to hurt. An old couple riding on a motorcycle parked next to us and asked us what we were doing. My father told them we had left the keys inside car. The old man helped us open one of the car doors. We thanked him and said goodbye as we went inside the car.  We decided to head home, exhausted from the whole trip. Even though the destination had changed we enjoyed the trip, and everyone quickly forgot about the incident with the keys. My mother and sisters started joking around, and for the first time since coming out of the hospital my father began laughing.	20	18	40
21419	8	The @CAPS1 of Laughter   The @CAPS1 of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. Laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. In all of my relationships I have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. I have come to notice lately that I have an amazing best friend. @PERSON1 is always here for me even after the mistake I made that ended tearing us apart. Now that we have gotten over The @CAPS2 and can laugh about it, I've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it.   The @CAPS2 began last @DATE1 during my @CAPS4 soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. It was the hardest thing to admit that I had done wrong; both to her and him. The day we had gotten caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The @CAPS2 has also become a big learning point in my life, I've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I should actually do.   When I first started soccer for @CAPS4, I had never played with any of the people and I realized that by being the youngest on a @NUM1 team I would have to stand out and prove myself. Which is exactly what I did; just not to the whole team. After playing for about two weeks I had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. I hadn't really thought much about it but when both me and him started to pursue our relationship it became a whole other thing. The boy and I had been dating for about a month and a half when this began to involve @PERSON1. See we weren't exactly allowed to hang out or even date for that matter, but we knew that we would take the chance of getting into trouble for each other. And as time went on and we had began to get closer to each other, we also had began falling in love. That @MONTH1 have been the reason I had chosen what I had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense.    Then the @ORGANIZATION1 came around and we thought it would be the perfect time to see each other, little did we know this choice would result in us losing each other, me losing my freedom, both of us ruining my parent's trust and the worst of all me throwing away a great friend. We didn't think of these consequences so we went through with it. He would meet me at the @ORGANIZATION1 and I would tell my parents that I was just going to be with @PERSON1. At the beginning and throughout most of the time everything was going well me and him were having an amazing time because we could finally hang out with one another and nobody knew what was really going on. Little did I know that my mother had called @PERSON1's mom to make sure that I was going to be were I said and with who I said, and as soon as she found out I wasn't everything went down hill from there.    It had already been a couple hours and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the greasy food at the @ORGANIZATION1 so we decided to take yet another chance and leave, with me leaving @PERSON1 at the @ORGANIZATION1 and her not knowing were I went. As my mom became more and more worried she starting calling @PERSON1 to see were I was and of course @PERSON1 had no idea. On her list to call next was me. When my mom first tried calling me I decided not to answer and have her think i was just on a ride or something, but when she kept calling I knew that something was wrong. As I answered the phone I knew that she knew what I had been doing, but I still didn't want to believe what was happening. I thought that the only way my mom could have found out was because @PERSON1 called and told her that she couldn't find me and who I was with.    So that is what I ended up accusing @PERSON1 of for at least a month after it happened. I couldn't look at her or even talk to her with out feeling resentment and embarrassment. When everything finally settled down, from being caught to being grounded the whole @DATE2, I knew that I needed to apologize for the position I put @PERSON1 in. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. But now knowing that @PERSON1 and I can laugh about it makes remembering that time so much easier and better.	20	23	43
21426	8	 When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 were like, what the home was like, and if they would like me or not. I was told I was going to have two new sisters named @PERSON2 and @CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS4 my heart began to pound harder and harder at the passing of every street, coming closer each second to the home that I would soon be able to call my own. Approaching the driveway I saw a well laid out, one story blue house. The door was opened by a really tall well built man, who appeared to just have gotten off of work. He was very welcoming and said his name was @CAPS5, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull whose name was @CAPS6. To the right was a girl with short hair who was a little bit taller than little five foot three inch me, whose name was @CAPS3. I was a year older than her though, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was observing me and then finally when I did notice, she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met @CAPS1 who said her name was @PERSON1, I automatically felt this warm feeling of acceptance right away. She was also a little bit taller than me, and was very pretty. They told me that I would be meeting @PERSON2, my older sister the following @DATE1 because she was attending college in @LOCATION1 at @ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other. I became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The response I got was quite different than what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they have never had to ground any of the girls, the only thing that I should make sure to do is simply respect everyone in the household. Finally @CAPS2 decided it was time for the grand tour of the home. My room was a bed room that at the moment was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with @CAPS3 in her room for a few weeks until @CAPS2 could get all of the things taken out into a shed he was going to built outside in the back yard. The continuous rain kept him from being able to do anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the bay window next to the kitchen. Since plan A didn't work out for my room, @CAPS1 ended up having the office be converted into my room and the bay window area was converted into an office space for @CAPS2 to be able to run his business. Each week that passed I began to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because @CAPS1 was a really great cook. @CAPS1 would take me to counseling sessions to make the transition into the family an easy one. I have never had any one put my needs first before, and it made me feel loved for once in my life. It was always really easy to talk to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, but I would always find it a little bit harder to talk to @CAPS3. I was always worrying about saying too much or not saying enough, even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to get to know what her interests were, but she would constantly be with her friends or be doing her homework.  It wasn't until my @ORGANIZATION1 was having a @CAPS18 @CAPS19 fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend @PERSON3 and I went along to pay for their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice creams we all sat down at a table when all of a sudden, @ORGANIZATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 friends show up and decide to leave @CAPS3. I see the hurt in @CAPS3's stare right away, so I began to tell her a funny story of something that had happened to me. After I was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own. We kept talking back and forth in a reciprocal conversation, and without realizing it we were really enjoying ourselves. It wasn't until later that week when I went to see the counselor that I learned laughter brings people together and connects them in ways one cannot imagine. To this day @CAPS3 and I are really close, and we even prank each other now. I love my little sister @CAPS3.	21	20	41
21449	8	"One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs ""bro bro""! This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an ipod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering ""its ok"". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. I forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories. "	16	16	32
21480	8	  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 year's old I had a and @CAPS1. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks, or go to the beach, or go to the parks. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS5-@CAPS6, popcorn,big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS1 was because he always smelt like @CAPS1. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS3 he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because head I really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS3 he had puppies i finally realized in my head @CAPS1 just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS1 but @CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS3 we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS11 too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS1 or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but there stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS1 was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS1 did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS3 ever he doggy-paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS3 I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS3 I am sad i just go and think of @CAPS1. I had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, there lazy.What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS14. Why I named that cat @CAPS14 was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS3 ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS15 because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS3 ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my life to be with gave me a story of laughter in my life, and happiness. Laughter I think is a good important part of relationships too. If you do not laugh in your relationship then I believe that the couple are not so happy. Laughter can be good many time's, but also can be a insult too. If it means becoming a insult to some people or even laughing at people is rude.  Having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life. To be happy you should have laughter.	15	17	32
21490	8	  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart.	25	25	50
21495	8	     Every one laughs, i love to laugh in fact that's one of my favorite things to do. If your in a bad mood or just cant get happy, laugh at things cause i am sure it will lighten up your mood and i will tell you what, its also very good for you in many ways. If people didn't laugh then this world world would be a very depressing, you smile at someone who isn't the happiest could totally change their mood. So as i have told you before i am a very happy and energetic person and laughing is what i do best,and i smile at everyone around me. well i have a story for you, i like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks home cause i believe i should share my happiness with everyone else around me it makes my soul feel good to help people out. This one after noon i was doing what i do best laughing and having a good time at the old folks home making people smile, they all love having me around cause they say i cheer them up. I run around room to room bringing in vases of flowers opening their curtains to let the beautiful sunshine in, i always told them vitamin @CAPS1 is good to warm up the soul. There was this one man there who had never have a smile on his face and i did the same to him as i did to the other residents and no matter what i did he would never smile. When ever i came in he was always gazing out the window with a dead look on his face, so i had ask the nurses why he was so grumpy and quiet and they had told me he was a veteran. He didn't have much family from what i understood, or well at least they didn't visit him much they just dropped him off cause they didn't want to deal with the grumpiness any more. but i have a heart of gold and i feel like i should share. I had decided one day that i was going to turn that frown on his cute little face upside down, and make him feel happy and smile and interact with the other residents. So as usual i went in and did my daily routine to all the other rooms, we talked did some laughing and all sorts of stuff. I had saved the little old man for last i wasn't sure what his name was or what the what his whole background was like but i was going to go for it! I went in and he was staring out the window as usual, i hesitated for a minute cause i didn't know how he would react. So i went up and started talking to him, i introduced m self but he didn't seem to pleased. I asked him his name and he told me it was none of my business and that totally shot me down made me feel like i was the bad guy. So i started talking to him and asked him about his life, he had slowly opened up to and told me about all the stuff he had seen in the @LOCATION1 war. He turned out to be a nice guy, all those nurses were wrong about him they didn't even try. We laughed for hours me and him, and it didn't get old. Ever since i talked to him he has been progressively started interacting with the others, they just didn't give him the time of day to explain his feelings or someone to talk to. So think about it next time your going to the store and you see someone who doesn't look like they're having the best day, and shot them a smile!!! :)	18	18	36
21514	8	" I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know ""live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it."" I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa"" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @CAPS1 your blue just think about something that will always make you laugh and laugh about it."	15	19	34
21522	8	 It was the middle of @DATE1 and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten I still played with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on vacation surfing in @LOCATION1, or roasting marshmallows over the roaring fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring @DATE1 break anyone has ever had until one day in @DATE3. The day I met @PERSON1 was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON1 because of my brother and his sister, they had had crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents but, that also meant that her brother @PERSON1, and I, would have to tag along also. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only chuckled when I would crack a joke here an there. As time went on though, I must have grew on him, because a few days later he was laughing at practically every joke I made.  Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late @DATE2. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his family, and his good friend @CAPS1. @CAPS1 couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON1. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because why i hadn't was a good enough reason not to.  We spent half the night talking, and laughing, and really just getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when @PERSON1, and his family moved to @LOCATION2, where they were from. After they moved I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON1, telling me that they were going to move back.  I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. @PERSON1 came back for about another solid @NUM1 years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to @LOCATION2 again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. @PERSON1 had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes.	20	18	40
21525	8	" Laughter can be a good think and sometimes it could be a sad thing. When me and my family went to @LOCATION3 we went for my two little brothers appointment. We left a little early so we could have some vacation time. When we arrived to where were going we got onto a fairy to go to a island up in @LOCATION1. On are way there my sister @PERSON1 was acting like she was on the titanic she had the dress and everything. My brothers and dad and i just couldn't stop laughing at her because she is eighteen. @CAPS5 while we stayed down there we were at are uncles house and they have a little dog and she was running from it and she fell so hard and my family and i weren't trying to laugh at her but it's kinda hard. After we went to lunch with are uncle and aunt we went to there military base @PERSON1 would not keep here hands off of the jets. What my family and i thought was so funny is @PERSON1 is eighteen and the rest of us are fourteen or younger so i guess we just like to pick on @LOCATION2. When we went to @LOCATION3 it was the night before the boy's appointment and are family and us went to the under ground tour of @LOCATION3. Well after that was all done we went to the gift shop that come's up at the end of the tour well @PERSON1 buys a pin that said something no so good and after she bought it are @CAPS4 had seen it she threw it away because she doesn't like things like that but @PERSON1 pulled out of the trash. After that all of us got hungry so we went to this place where they sale some really @CAPS1 tacos and we got a order and we sat down well we also got some sodas and my other sister and i took a bite of are food and took a drink of are food @CAPS5 @PERSON1 says ""oh my gosh there are two really hot guys right there"" @CAPS5 sierra take the biggest gulp of tapattao and i don't remember what @PERSON1 said but she said something and it made me and sierra bust up laughing and we spit are food all over @LOCATION2 she gets up and screams. So of course are parents and family don't want to be there anymore because we embarrassed them so we all started to walk up to the car and right when are uncle @PERSON3 yelled @PERSON1 don't fall because thins is where i fell all you hear is are sister falling behind us is was so funny. What made it even more funny was that me and sierra just started to stop laughing and oh my goodness we were laughing the whole way to the car. Are whole way home @PERSON1 was mad at us because we were still laughing at her but we went to the beach she was over it. I think when we went to the beach that was the place where we started to bond a lot more because we were all playing no cell phones lots of picture rock climbing that was fun we left @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS2 behind a couple of times @CAPS5 @PERSON2 tried to keep throwing me into the water so i would pushed him back @CAPS5 @PERSON2 threw a rock at @LOCATION2 and she fell over. When we were all taking a picture on a @CAPS1 log we were all shaking it and @PERSON1 sierra and i all fell of and i hurt my arm so we had to go to the doctors. A month after we got home are @CAPS4 took @PERSON1, sierra, aunt @PERSON4 and i to @CAPS3 on ice and that was probably the best time of my life. Are @CAPS4 says ""i don't know what's funnier @PERSON1 waving to the actors on the ice that cant see her in the dark or the show."" @CAPS5 are aunt said""yeah thank you @CAPS6 for making me sit next to her."" @CAPS5 when the cartoon toys story came on sierra and i said""look @PERSON1 what are you doing on the ice arena and she thought that we were talking about the pig and we were all no the little troll and @CAPS4 and aunt @PERSON4 just busted up laughing it was hilarious. When we went home we were all talking about it and laughing and she got mad because were always making fun of her because she is short but when it comes to us she thinks its so funny. There is a lot of laughter in our family and i cant wait to have more in it so that when i grow up I'll have a lot of good memories beside me and I'll still look back like i am now and I'll say wow what good times i have had since i grew up. When we are family laughs together i think that is the time when we actually communicate"	15	15	30
21530	8	" Laughter, one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world. Everyone can relate to it and there's no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing. It's human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people; we are social beings, and laughter is the best way to connect to other people. There is no negativity in laughing, unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment, and in general, if people are laughing, they would say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences that they have with other people, for example dating. On a first date, it's to be expected, and an important factor, for the two people to be having fun and laughing. Other wise, when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts, their impression could make or break the relationship. That's why a first impression is so important. When the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you remember the first time you met them, and how you felt afterward, the way you felt then, could tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people, it's difficult, but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new, and they will usually tell you, ""make them laugh"". It's a universal term, anyone can do it. This past month, basketball season has started and I am playing on a whole different team then I did last year. Only half the girls on my team last year are still here, and I have had to make a connection with girls who are younger then me, and who I haven't yet gotten to know. I start to think about all the new girls, and who I have already made connections with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter. Everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court. No matter how difficult the practice @MONTH1 get, you can never become to exhausted when someone is making you laugh. Laughter is needed in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun about life? Image life if it were like detention all the time, never being able to just let loose, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go insane, laughter calms people down and mellows them out. It helps create people's personalities and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in the water, it starts as just one single person, then expands out touching anyone near it. Laughing is contagious, like a @CAPS1 in mid @DATE1, and brings joy to you and the people you can touch.  Laughter, it's the foundation of happiness."	25	21	46
21533	8	 My dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning ofcourse, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completeing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a carwash with me in control. I didnt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but i was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before i could do all that the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was succesful. Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasnt the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter. We had not stoppped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!	17	18	35
21537	8	 In the @DATE1 of @NUM1' I spent two weeks at my aunt's house. At the time my cousins were living with her. My cousins and I are very close so we liked to spend time together. On evening we decided to watch a movie. I remember it was called my bestfriend's girl. So we started to watch the movie and it was super funny, we laughed constantly through out it. My cousin named @PERSON1 has an awesome laugh, everytime he started to laugh I couldn't help but laugh too. We watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food. We were all in a very good mood, making jokes and doing crazy things to make each other laugh or be funny. My cousins would change their voices, making then higher or lower repeating lines from the movie or just making things up. That night we ate @ORGANIZATION1. When we got back to my aunt's house none of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night program called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was a program composed of a bunch of short cartoons. They were all very funny. We would make fun of them and laugh and mimic what the characters did.  We stopped watching it at about @NUM2 in the @TIME1, I was very tired but my cousins were not. For awhile we just sat on the couches and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid things that would make us laugh. About a hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while I was staying there. It was probably the best time of that @DATE1. I was very happy and enjoyed my @DATE1 because of my two cousins and the time we spend together. I laughed so much that my stomach would hurt all the time, but I didn't care because I was happy. I still spend time with my cousins and laugh a lot. I believe that our time spent together and shared laughter has brought us closer and more involed in each others lives. A person who can laugh, knows how to have a good time, and is fun to be around.	16	17	33
21548	8	" Laughter, one of the wonderful things that we humans can enjoy. Laughter with friends, family, and with people we do not even know. We all can enjoy and share laughter, it is one of the amazing things that can bring us together no matter what ethnicity, age, gender, or disability. We all can enjoy it together, and no one can take it away from us. Laughter is simple, but yet complex in many ways. It is like falling into a pool of @CAPS1. Laughter, just the word ""laughter"" brings me joy! When our days go sour laughter is there to sweeten it up. Where would we be without the wonders of laughter? Laughter, it is like a tool. It is the thing that has helped me make new friends. Also, laughter has helped me get out of conflicts from both friends and enemies. It has also aided me into achieving the things I want. Laughter is @CAPS2 my middle school years. My family and I moved a lot, and every time I moved I had to make new friends. It got very difficult for me to make new friends every time I transferred to a new school. After I have settled down and got used to the surroundings of the new school I then started to make friends. I noticed that laughter was a key element on making people like you, and then later consider you to be what is known as a friend. After I have made new friends, and became very comfortable with my school the time to move came again. It gets difficult to make new friends, but its even harder when you have to leave the new friends you just made behind. After moving so much I just got used to making new friends, and later on laughter slowly became more like a tool than something that I should enjoy. A tool for just making friends. After I got into high school I just stopped trying to make new friends, because I felt that I knew I was going to make new friends, and then transfer to another school, and then start all over and make new friends again. I gave up trying and decided to get more involved in school and achieve good grades. Later in the year I felt like a kid with no friends, because I stopped trying. I decided to go and make new friends, but somehow it became a lot harder to make friends in high school than middle school. I tried to be the funny guy like I was in middle school, but I just didn't have it in me anymore. Also, when people get older the type of humor people enjoy changes. As time went by I realized that you don't have to make everyone laugh, so they can be your friend. It was about getting to now the person, and to be able to relate and to be a there when they needed you the most. Making friends at a new school is not easy, but it also is not very hard. All you got to do is be open to people and let them know who you are. This is what I learned about making friends. You can't make everyone laugh, because everyone has a different taste in humor. Humor and laughter are different from each other. Everyone has a different taste in humor, but we can all come together and have a good laugh. Laughter is wonderful. It is what puts people in a good mood. We as people @MONTH1 have our differences, but we can still all laugh together. It feels very good when you get a good laugh, but its even better when you know that the person who made you laugh did it so you can be happy. We should not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our faces.  "	15	20	35
21555	8	 The elements of laughter is to show emotion to other to let them know that you had a great time or to show that there are special. Laughter is some times in me. I laught when I have a great time. The greates laughter I always have is with friends saying crazy thing when we go to the bus after school. That the joy from friend and you to reales the tens strees from school. I always go home with a smile. Theres always jokes to tell to have joy. When the bell rings with in the end of my last class, I am tierd from working hard. When I go to my bus located on the front of the school. I feel strees out from the work I had to do. But I can't wait till my friends come to the bus. We always have a great time. I comepletely forget about school and laugh with the jokes and rediculace story we say. When we get to the first stop everyone gets out with joy even me. This prosses has lasted for three years. But the next year is going to be ower last ride from the bus @NUM1 my favorite number. I hope we will still have the great time.	10	15	25
21558	8	" Many believe that laughter is the key to the start of a great friendship. @CAPS1 can mend the broken bridges between people and even make awesome relationships even better. Laughter can be such a powerful thing and most don't understand @CAPS7 powerful. I especially didn't know until two years ago when I met @PERSON1. @CAPS1 only took the move of my former @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to understand laughter's full potential of the beginning of a great friendship @CAPS1 all started a couple weeks before school ended when the news was received. At the time i was part of a small @CAPS3 group, in a small church, in a small town. @CAPS3 @CAPS2, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 were moving, and would no longer be able to lead the @CAPS3 group. The entire church congregation was saddened by the sudden news. But none were as depressed as the @CAPS3 that they had touched in their many years in ministry. We had grown used to the couple. Many of the few that had been around the longest , including myself, had spent nights at their house, or in my case babysat their young daughter. They were like family to all of us and no one wanted to see them go. But sometimes I wonder if they hadn't what would have happened. Many well wishes and tears were exchanged between the day they had departed. As a congregation everyone thought that no one could ever touch our hearts they way that they had. But that was just a thought. Two short months later, word had gotten around that someone from @LOCATION1 was traveling here to our small town in @LOCATION2 for an interview for the newly open position. All the teenagers were guarded the moment that he had walked through the door. His name was @PERSON1, only in his early twenties, but had quite a lot of experience in ministry. My first thought was that this must be some kind of joke! @CAPS7 could he lead a group of kids if he's only a kid himself!? I wasn't very keen of him. Neither was anybody else. But something was very different about him. He wasn't afraid to tell us about his life, @CAPS7 he had grown up, and seemed to be totally honest with everyone of our questions we asked. And that was when we knew as a @CAPS3 group that maybe he was the one.  Even though I knew @PERSON1 would be our new @CAPS3 @CAPS4 I still didn't want to accept @CAPS1. I tried and tried to avoid him although @CAPS1 always seemed we were having to deal with each other more than either of us wanted to. So finally, @PERSON1 decided @CAPS1 was time that the two of us needed to get to know each other. One @DATE1 @TIME1 my mom got a call from someone at the church, she wouldn't tell me who, but that I needed to go. So I did. And who was there? @PERSON1, in the sanctuary just the two of us and the associate @CAPS4, because @CAPS1 would be too inappropriate for us to be by ourselves. "" your mom didn't tell you @CAPS6 your here, did she?""I laughed, "" @CAPS6 no she didn't"" "" @CAPS7 do you feel you and I talk? Go hang out, wherever you want?""""um....ok @CAPS7 do you feel about going to @ORGANIZATION1?"" The question was puzzling to him, @CAPS1 did to most, but he accepted the idea. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS6 are we going to @ORGANIZATION1?"" he said as he pulled into the parking lot."" I don't know @CAPS1 was just the first thing that popped into my head.""We both chuckled. I felt more at ease with him now and actually thought for the first time that maybe this would be a pretty fun trip.  As we walked through the building @CAPS1 started to be quite boring. But the boredom faded away as we decided to pass through the toy aisle, and set off all of the toy alarms and sirens. Toy after toy had started to go off as we went through the aisle touching every toy that made some kind of absurd noise that would drive anyone up the wall, which many did. Finally we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other a little better. @CAPS1 surprised me that both of us liked a lot of the same things. He told me more of his childhood like @CAPS7 he was adopted and what @CAPS1 was like before hand and afterwards. @CAPS1 was wierd that only a short time ago I didn't want anything to do with @PERSON1 and now I was walking around @ORGANIZATION1 laughing and just having a good time. That was about three years or so ago. Shortly after @PERSON1 had to leave. Many rumors were told @CAPS6 because he didn't really tell anyone other than the fact that the council had asked him to leave. No matter the reason I still am in touch with him and am glad that the day at @ORGANIZATION1 had happended."	18	20	38
21563	8	" The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS2, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?"" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON1 and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come."	21	25	46
21570	8	Laughter A true story that involves @CAPS4 and laughter was when i was hanging out with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiance @PERSON4 (who is a profesional quad racer) at a @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2. The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM1 because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS11. A lot of things made @CAPS4 laughlike when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert and it wasnt as good. But it was still awesome.	16	15	31
21609	8	 Laughter, to me, is an important aspect of my relationship with anyone. I cherish laughter, and I employ it at every chance that I receive. To many, laughter @MONTH1 be trivial, but to me, it holds the key to my relationships with other people. Without laughter, many of the wonderful people I have met in my life, might not be their because I used laughter to develop them into friendships.  Friends were hard to come by in my childhood. I did not make good choices, not with whom I associated myself with; rather, with how I approached other people for the first time. I would come off as brash, rude, or annoying, to name a few among many. I had no experience with making relationships, and the first impression is very important. Just like any meal, the first sense that is appealed to, is sight. The image of the meal floods the mind, next, the aroma floats aimlessly towards you, and you begin to salivate in anticipation. And like any recipe, to perfect it, you must practice, and that is what I did. It was a long and arduous process, but come my sophomore year in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I began to feel like I mastered the art of making other people laugh. As students, and individuals, people come and go, we @MONTH1 truly end up forgetting their entire being, or we @MONTH1 leave an impression on their mind. I try this through laughter; to be remembered if not, only for a day. Using laughter, I acquired new opportunities to make friends, and I did not squander those opportunities. I surrounded myself in a net of laughter, I developed the necessary skills to make people laugh. I enjoyed it, and I still do. One relationship that I built, is with a young women. I had never spoken to her before, until our teacher put us into a group together. Laughter was the essential building block of our future relationship. I was myself, I would not pretend to be someone I'm not, I would express puns that our youth are so fond of, euphemisms our generation know all to well. We would listen to the same music, and gradually, our relationship was nurtured into a stead-fast friendship. It has developed to the point were, in class, we long for each others company. We look for classes to have together because we love to make each other laugh. And because of laughter, I have made a friend with whom I share secrets, time, and moments with which I shall forever cherish. Recently she has decided to start playing tennis. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. I would like nothing more to help her, and whomever so decides to partake in my leadership. I do not necessarily claim to be the best, but I am confident in my abilities to teach the techniques, and fundamentals of the game. Their is not much more I would like to do, that is to play the sport that I love, with the women I love. And most of the credit belongs to laughter because, when her amiable face lights up from something I said, it means all the world to me, whether she knows it, or not. I have many such connections with other people from both sexes, but none so much as hers. I worked hard to build connections with other people because they would make life that mach easier, and that much more enjoyable. In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 their are no exclusive social groups, or roving bands of football players ready to pick out the weakest of the student population. We are all friends, we are all one community, we all belong, and that is due, in part, by laughter. Laughter connects people from around the world, it is the universal language every race, skin color, and religion all speak. It can bring us together or it can tear us apart, but in life, the medicine most prescribed, is laughter.	20	20	40
21615	8	"                              @ORGANIZATION1                                    @DATE1 for my @CAPS1 birthday we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for a week, @CAPS16 was so much fun when we got there but the drive was not fun at all. When we got to the house that @TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS16 was coming down so hard @CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS16 seriously looked like @CAPS16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS9 get @CAPS16 because my @CAPS17 was ""too tired"" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like ""@CAPS2 who are these boys?"" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS16 was my cousin @PERSON1, his best friend @PERSON2 and his other friend @CAPS3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS16 was funny because my whole @CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled""@CAPS4"" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like ""@CAPS5 great she is out here"". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON2 knew why i was doing @CAPS16 but @CAPS3 and @PERSON1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them ""@CAPS7"" and that irritated them so @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you"", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS16 so i told him ""@CAPS9 ahead"" @PERSON1 started to @CAPS9 but then @PERSON2 grabbed him,@CAPS10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS11 the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME1 and @PERSON1@NUM1 and @CAPS3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS11 @PERSON2 and @CAPS3 screaming at @PERSON1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE1 old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME1 they were not home @CAPS14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS15 and @LOCATION3, @CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS17, @CAPS18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS16 kind of sucked but @CAPS16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS16 was not fun at all but my @CAPS17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS16 was so fun being at @LOCATION1 we have made @CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS9 this @DATE1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE1 and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!"	15	17	32
